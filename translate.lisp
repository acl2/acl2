(defvar **1*-as-raw*

; When a *1* function is called and this variable is true, that function should
; behave as its corresponding raw Lisp function, except that critical guards
; for stobj updaters are checked.  We can live with that rather vague
; specification because this variable is nil unless we are under the call of a
; program mode function.

; For the sake of simplicity in the discussion below, we ignore the possibility
; that guard-checking is set to :none or :all and we ignore safe-mode.  Also,
; we assume that the value of state global 'check-invariant-risk is non-nil, as
; should always be the case unless someone is hacking; otherwise, the effect of
; this variable is defeated.

; Oneify-cltl-code uses this variable, **1*-as-raw*, to arrange that when a
; *1* :logic-mode function that calls mbe is itself called under a *1*
; :program-mode function, then the :exec code of that mbe call is evaluated,
; not the :logic code.  Our approach is basically as follows.  Globally,
; **1*-as-raw* is nil.  But we arrange the following, and explain below.
; 
; (a) The *1* code for an invariant-risk :program mode function binds
;     **1*-as-raw* to t.
; 
; (b) The *1* code for an mbe call reduces to its :exec code when **1*-as-raw*
;     is true.
;
; (c) Raw-ev-fncall binds **1*-as-raw* to nil for :logic mode functions.
;
; (d) Oneify binds **1*-as-raw* to nil when ec-call is applied to a :logic
;     mode function.

; Without invariant-risk, none of this would be necessary: a :program mode
; function call would lead to raw Lisp evaluation, where each mbe call
; macroexpands to its :exec code.  But with invariant-risk, we need to stick
; with *1* execution in order to avoid making ill-guarded stobj updater calls,
; in which case (a) and (b) save us from execution of :logic code from an mbe
; call.  Note that the use of :exec code from mbe calls can be important for
; performance, as pointed out by Jared Davis.

; To see why we need (c), consider the following example.

;   (defstobj st (fld :type integer :initially 0))
;   
;   (defun lgc (st)
;     (declare (xargs :mode :logic
;                     :stobjs st
;                     :verify-guards nil))
;     (mbe :logic (prog2$ (cw "@@@LOGIC@@@~%")
;                         (update-fld 3 st))
;          :exec (prog2$ (cw "@@@EXEC@@@~%")
;                        (update-fld 4 st))))
;   
;   (defun foo (state st)
;     (declare (xargs :mode :program :stobjs (state st)))
;     (let ((st (update-fld 7 st)))
;       (mv-let (erp val state)
;               (trans-eval
;                '(thm (equal (with-local-stobj
;                              st
;                              (mv-let (val st)
;                                      (let ((st (lgc st)))
;                                        (mv (fld st) st))
;                                      val))
;                             4)) 'top state t)
;               (mv erp val state st))))

; The proof should fail when calling (foo state st), since logically, the value
; of the with-local-stobj form is 3, not 4.  But since foo has invariant-risk,
; **1*-as-raw* is bound to t when calling *1*foo, so we might expect that
; evaluation of the mbe form under (lgc st) would use the :exec form, leading
; erroneously to a successful proof!  However, we bind **1*-as-raw* to nil in
; raw-ev-fncall precisely to avoid such a probem.

; To see why we need (d), see the example in a comment in oneify that starts
; with "(defun f-log".

; Essay on EV

; Ev, below, will take the following arguments:

; (ev form alist state latches hard-error-returns-nilp aok)

; It returns (mv erp val latches').

; Ev is actually defined in terms of ev-rec, an analogous function that
; takes the ACL2 world rather than state.

; Hard-error-returns-nil is explained in the comment in hard-error.
; We do not deal with it further below.

; Aok is short for "Attachments are OK", and as the name suggests,
; allows the use of attachments when non-nil.  This parameter is discussed at
; some length near the end of this Essay.  Till then, we assume that its value
; is nil.

; Imprecise Spec: If erp is t, some evaluation error occurred (e.g.,
; an unbound variable was encountered).  Otherwise, erp is nil, val is
; the value of form under alist, and latches' is the final value of
; all the single-threaded objects after the evaluation of form.

; But there are many subtle issues here having to do with the handling
; of single-threaded objects.  In the following discussion we use
; (bump state) as a generic function that changes state, as by
; incrementing a global variable in state and returning the modified
; state.

; Assumptions on the input to EV:

; (0) If latches is nil, then either form is known not to modify any
;     stobjs (in which case it really doesn't matter what latches is) or
;     else there are no live stobjs in alist.  In short, if latches is
;     nil, we don't keep track of the current values of the stobjs but you
;     better not ev a form on a live object (because it will actually
;     change the object but not record the new current value on latches).

; (1) If latches is non-nil, then if a stobj name, such as STATE, is bound
;     in alist to some value s then
;     (1a) s is of the correct shape for that stobj and
;     (1b) that stobj name is bound in latches to s.
;     Informally, the initial values of the stobjs in alist are identical
;     to their initial current values and consistent with the stobj
;     definitions.

; (2) If alist binds a stobj name to a live object, then form must be
;     single-threaded.

; Clarification of the output spec:

; If no stobj names are bound in alist to live objects, then the
; latches on input may be nil and the final latches may
; be ignored.

; If form is not single-threaded, the meaning of the final latches
; is essentially random.

; In the most common case (where we are using ev to evaluate a form
; typed by the user at the top-level), state is *the-live-state*, all
; the stobj names are bound in alist to their current live objects
; (including 'state to *the-live-state*), and form is single-threaded.

; Observations about the Assumptions

; The only way alist can bind a stobj name to a live object is if we
; did that in our own source code.  In particular, a user cannot write
; (list (cons 'state state) (cons '$s $s)), unless the user has access to
; something like coerce-state-to-object.  These comments assume such
; magic functions have been made untouchable.

; No live object can be in the final latches unless they were
; there to begin with.  If a live object is in the final current
; stobjs, then it was put there by a stobj producing fncall.  But that
; would mean there was a live stobj in alist.  That, in turn, means
; the same live object was originally in the initial current stobjs.

; Thus, the only time live objects appear in the final latches
; is if we're in our own source code.

; We guarantee, via functions like trans-eval, that assumptions (1)
; and (2) are met in all our calls of ev.

; Further Discussion of the Assumptions:

; Suppose that the symbol 'state is bound in alist to s.  Suppose the
; value of the formal parameter state is d.  Both s and d are
; state-ps.  We call the latter state d because it is the state from
; which ev obtains the definitions of the functions.  We also use d to
; determine whether guards should be checked.  D is not changed in ev,
; except to decrement the big clock in it to ensure termination.

; By assumption (1), we know that the binding of state in
; latches is s, initially.  But in general, the two bindings
; can differ: the binding of state in alist is the initial value of
; state and the binding in the final latches is the final value
; of state.

; Generally speaking, d is *the-live-state*.  Indeed, at one point we
; believed:

; The Bogus Live State Claim for :Program Mode Functions: If a
; :program mode function takes STATE as an argument then the function
; can only be evaluated on the live state.

; Below I give a ``proof'' of this claim, for a call of ev stemming
; from a legal form typed by the user to the top-level ACL2 loop.
; Then I give a counterexample!

; ``PROOF:'' The call was translated.  Since ev is a :program mode
; function, the call cannot appear in a theorem or other context in
; which the stobj restrictions were not enforced.  Hence, the only
; allowable term in the state slot is state itself.  Hence, state must
; be *the-live-state*, as it is at the top of LP.

; Now here is a way to run ev from within the loop on a state other
; than the live state: Ev a call of ev.  Here is a concrete form.
; First, go outside the loop and call (build-state) to obtain a dummy
; state.  I will write that '(NIL ... NIL).  At present, it has 15
; components, most of which are nil, but some, like the initial global
; table, are non-trivial.  Then inside the loop execute:

; (let ((st (build-state)))
;    (ev `(ev 'a '((a . 1)) ',st 'nil 'nil 't) nil state nil nil t))

; The outermost state above is indeed the live one, but the inner ev is
; executed on a dummy state.  The computation above produces the result
; (NIL (NIL 1 NIL) NIL).

; The inner state object has to pass the state-p predicate if guard
; checking is enabled in the outer state.  If guard checking is turned
; off in the live state, the following example shows the inner ev
; running on something that is not even a state-p.  To make this
; example work, first evaluate :set-guard-checking nil.

; (ev '(ev 'a '((a . 1)) '(nil nil nil nil nil 0) 'nil 'nil 't)
;     nil state nil nil t)

; The 0, above, is the big-clock-entry and must be a non-negative
; integer.  The result is (NIL (NIL 1 NIL) NIL).

; Finally, the example below shows the inner ev running a function,
; foo, defined in the dummy world.  It doesn't matter if foo is
; defined in the live state or not.  The example below shows the state
; returned by build-state at the time of this writing, but modified to
; have a non-trivial CURRENT-ACL2-WORLD setting giving FORMALS and a
; BODY to the symbol FOO.

; The output of the ev above is (NIL (NIL (DUMMY-FOO . 1) NIL) NIL).

; The above example can be made slightly more interesting by replacing
; the three occurrences of FOO by EV.  It still produces the same
; thing and illustrate the fact that EV doesn't mean what you might
; think it means once you get into an EV!

; The intuition that ``d must be *the-live-state*'' is only true at
; the outermost call of EV.  But things take care of themselves inside
; subsequent calls because, if d is not *the-live-state*, EV just runs
; as defined, whatever that means.

; Stobj Latching:  How Do We Compute the Final Latches?

; This is simpler than it at first appears: First, we map over the
; term in evaluation order.  Every time we apply a function symbol to
; a list of (evaluated) terms, we ``latch'' into latches each of
; the stobj values indicated by the symbol's stobjs-out.

; The order of the sweep is controlled by ev and ev-lst.  But all the
; latching is done by ev-fncall.  This is surprising because ev-fncall
; does not handle LAMBDAs and translation has entirely eliminated all
; MV-LETs and MVs.

; Let us consider some examples to see why this works -- and to drive
; home some points it took me a while to see.  In the following,

; (defun bump (state) (f-put-global 'bump (@ bump) state))
; (defun bump3 (x state) (let ((state (bump state))) (mv nil x state)))

; Consider the translate (==>) of

; :trans (let ((state (bump state)))
;             (mv a state b))
; ==>
; ((LAMBDA (STATE B A)
;          (CONS A (CONS STATE (CONS B 'NIL))))
;  (BUMP STATE)
;  B A)

; Sweep order is (BUMP STATE), B, A, and then the CONS nest.  Of these, only
; the BUMP has a non-trivial stobjs-out.  We latch the state coming out of
; (BUMP STATE).

; :trans (mv-let (erp val state)
;                (bump3 x state)
;                (mv (and erp val) (cons erp val) state))

; ==>
; ((LAMBDA (MV)
;          ((LAMBDA (ERP VAL STATE)

;           (MV-NTH '2 MV)))

; We latch the third value of (BUMP3 X STATE), when we ev-fncall BUMP3.
; The next non-trivial stobjs-out function we ev-fncall is the BUMP.
; We latch its result, which gives us the final latches.

; The restrictions imposed by translate ensure that we will never
; encounter terms like (fn a (bump state) b (bump state) c) where
; there is more than one latched stobj coming out of an arglist.  But
; we do not exploit this fact.  We just latch every stobj-out as we go
; across the args.  Similarly, the translate restrictions ensure that
; if a stobj is returned by some function, then it gets out.  So we
; can latch it when it is returned by the function, even though it
; apparently goes into a CONS nest, say, from which it may not, a
; priori, get out.

; We close with a discussion of the final argument of ev and many other
; evaluator functions, aok.  In short: The safe value for aok is nil, but it is
; more powerful (fewer aborts) to use t rather than nil for aok, if that is
; sound.  Unless you are writing ACL2 system code, it probably is sound to use
; t.  But now we discuss in more depth the question of assigning a value to
; aok.

; Most or all of the evaluator functions (ev, ev-fncall, trans-eval,
; simple-translate-and-eval, etc.) have a final argument called aok, which is
; mnemonic for "attachments OK".  The conservative value to use is nil, which
; means that no attachments (in the sense of defattach) will be used by the
; evaluator.  But if you want attachments to be allowed by the evaluator, then
; use aok = t.

; In ACL2's own source code, aok is usually t, but it is (and must of course,
; be) nil whenever we are simplifying terms during a proof.  See the Essay on
; Defattach for related discussion.

; Here, in brief, is the logical story (which is important to understand when
; deciding to use aok=t).  The evaluator functions can all be thought of as
; producing a result that is provably equal to a given term.  But the question
; is: Provably equal in what formal theory?  The "official" theory of the
; current ACL2 world has nothing to do with attachments, and is the theory for
; which we have a prover.  So if the rewriter, say, wants to use ev-fncall to
; replace one term by another, the input and output terms should be provably
; equal without attachments, which is why we use aok=nil in the call of
; ev-fncall under rewrite.  On the other hand, in the top-level loop we
; presumably want to use all attachments -- the whole point of (defattach f g)
; for an encapsulated f and defined g is to evaluate under the equation (equal
; (f x) (g x)).  So the call of trans-eval under ld-read-eval-print has aok=t.

; Thus, if you are calling simple-translate-and-eval for something like hints,
; then probably it's fine to use aok=t -- hints don't affect soundness and one
; might want to take advantage of attachments.  As ACL2 evolves, many of its
; system functions may be encapsulated with default attachments, so one will
; want to use aok=t whenever possible in order to avoid an "undefined function"
; error when such a system function is called.

; Event Tuples

; Every time an event occurs we store a new 'global-value for the
; variable 'event-landmark in stop-event.  The value of
; 'event-landmark is an "event tuple."  Abstractly, an event tuple
; contains the following fields:

; n:     the absolute event number
; d:     the embedded event depth (the number of events containing the event)
; form:  the form evaluated that created the event.  (This is often a form
;        typed by the user but might have been a form generated by a macro.
;        The form may be a call of a primitive event macro, e.g., defthm,
;        or may be itself a macro call, e.g., prove-lemma.)
; type:  the name of the primitive event macro we normally use, e.g.,
;        defthm, defuns, etc.
; namex: the name or names of the functions, rules, etc., introduced by
;        the event.  This may be a single object, e.g., 'APP, or "MY-PKG",
;        or may be a true list of objects, e.g., '(F1 F2 F3) as in the case
;        of a mutually recursive clique.  0 (zero) denotes the empty list of
;        names.  The unusual event enter-boot-strap-mode has a namex containing
;        both symbols and strings.
; symbol-class:
;        One of nil, :program, :ideal, or :compliant-common-lisp, indicating
;        the symbol-class of the namex.  (All names in the namex have the same
;        symbol-class.)

; All event tuples are constructed by make-event-tuple, below.  By searching
; for all calls of that function you will ascertain all possible event types
; and namex combinations.  You will find the main call in add-event-landmark,
; which is used to store an event landmark in the world.  There is another call
; in primordial-world-globals, where the bogus initial value of the
; 'event-landmark 'global-value is created with namex 0 and event type nil.
; Add-event-landmark is called in install-event, which is the standard (only)
; way to finish off an ACL2 event.  If you search for calls of install-event
; you will find the normal combinations of event types and namex.  There are
; two other calls of add-event-landmark.  One, in in primordial-world where it
; is called to create the enter-boot-strap-mode event type landmark with namex
; consisting of the primitive functions and known packages.  The other, in
; end-prehistoric-world, creates the exit-boot-strap-mode event type landmark
; with namex 0.

; As of this writing the complete list of type and namex pairs
; is shown below, but the algorithm described above will generate
; it for you if you wish to verify this.

; To save space we do not actually represent each event tuple as a 6-tuple but
; have several different forms.  The design of our forms makes the following
; assumptions, aimed at minimizing the number of conses in average usage.  (1)
; Most events are not inside other events, i.e., d is often 0.  (2) Most events
; use the standard ACL2 event macros, e.g., defun and defthm rather than user
; macros, e.g., DEFN and PROVE-LEMMA.  (3) Most events are introduced with the
; :program symbol-class.  This last assumption is just the simple observation
; that until ACL2 is reclassified from :program to :logic, the ACL2
; system code will outweigh any application.

(defun make-event-tuple (n d form ev-type namex symbol-class skipped-proofs-p)

; An event tuple is always a cons.  Except in the initial case created by
; primordial-world-globals, the car is always either a natural (denoting n and

; symbol-class is :program and that the namex can be recovered from the form,
; or else the cadr is the pair (ev-type namex . symbol-class) signalling that
; the form is the cddr.

; Generally, the val encodes:
;  n - absolute event number
;  d - embedded event depth
;  form - form that created the event
;  ev-type - name of the primitive event macro we use, e.g., defun, defthm, defuns
;  namex - name or names introduced (0 is none)
;  symbol-class - of names (or nil)
;  skipped-proofs-p - t when the symbol-class is not :program (for simplicity
;                     of implementation, below) and skipped-proofs-p is t; else

;                     events that cannot perform proofs (see install-event) and

; Command Tuples

; When LD has executed a world-changing form, it stores a "command tuple" as
; the new 'global-value of 'command-landmark.  These landmarks divide the world
; up into "command blocks" and each command block contains one or or event
; blocks.  Command blocks are important when the user queries the system about
; his current state, wishes to undo, etc.  Commands are enumerated sequentially
; from 0 with "absolute command numbers."

; We define command tuples in a way analogous to event tuples, although
; commands are perhaps simpler because most of their characteristics are
; inherited from the event tuples in the block.  We must store the current
; default-defun-mode so that we can offer to redo :program functions after ubt.
; (A function is offered for redoing if its defun-mode is :program.  But the
; function is redone by executing the command that created it.  The command may
; recreate many functions and specify a :mode for each.  We must re-execute the
; command with the same default-defun-mode we did last to be sure that the
; functions it creates have the same defun-mode as last time.)

; reasons, e.g., to compute something, then hard-error should probably
; signal an error, because something is wrong.  In that case,
; hard-error-returns-nilp should be set to nil.  Nil is the

; Sketch: We know that form is a termp wrt w and that it is recognized by
; translated-acl2-unwind-protectp.  We therefore unpack it into its body and
; two cleanup forms and give it special attention.  If the body evaluates
; without either an abort or any kind of "evaluation error" (e.g., ubv, udf, or
; guard error) then we return exactly what we would have returned had we
; evaluated form without special treatment.  But if body causes an evaluation
; error we run the cleanup1 code, just as Common Lisp would had the body been
; compiled and caused a hard lisp error.  Furthermore, if the evaluation of
; body is aborted, we ensure that the cleanup1 code is EV'd upon unwinding.

; See the Essay on Unwind-Protect in axioms.lisp.

; This code implements our unwind-protection from aborts.  Intuitively, we wish
; to push the cleanup form onto the unwind-protect stack provided the STATE
; being modified is the live state.  It is possible that STATE is not bound in
; alist.  If this happens then it is certainly not the live state and we do not
; push anything.

; The next problem, however, is what do we push?  In normal circumstances --
; i.e., body terminating without an evaluation error but signalling an error --
; cleanup1 is evaluated by ev.  But cleanup1 is evaluated in w, which may or
; may not be the installed world.  Hence, the meaning in w of the function
; symbol in the car of cleanup1 may be different from the raw lisp definition
; (if any) of that symbol.  So we can't do the usual and just push the car of
; cleanup1 and the values (in alist) of the arguments.  Furthermore, there is
; delicacy concerning the possibility that not all of the argument variables
; are bound in alist.  To make matters slightly worse, we can't cause any
; errors right now, no matter how screwed up cleanup1 might be, because no
; abort has happened and we are obliged to respect the semantics unless an
; abort happens.  To make a long story short, we do what is pretty obvious: we
; push onto the undo stack a form that calls EV to do the cleanup!  We use
; FUNCTION to capture the local environment, e.g., alist, which contains the
; values of all the variables occurring in the cleanup form.

; The Essay on Unwind-Protect says that we have the freedom to give arbitrary

; Lisp code, we take the liberty of binding *ev-shortcut-okp* to t even though
; when this cleanup code is executed, we may violate the requirement that the
; values of state globals guard-checking-on and safe-mode are respected in the
; arguments to ev-rec when *ev-shortcut-okp* is t.  This seems like quite a

(defun untranslate1 (term iff-flg untrans-tbl preprocess-fn wrld)

; Warning: It would be best to keep this in sync with
; obviously-iff-equiv-terms, specifically, giving similar attention in both to
; functions like implies, iff, and not, which depend only on the propositional
; equivalence class of each argument.

; Warning: Consider keeping in sync with community book
; books/misc/rtl-untranslate.lisp.

; We return a Lisp form that translates to term if iff-flg is nil and
; that translates to a term iff-equivalent to term if iff-flg is t.
; Wrld is an ACL2 logical world, which may be used to improve the
; appearance of the result, in particular to allow (nth k st) to be
; printed as (nth *field-name* st) if st is a stobj name and
; field-name is the kth field name of st; similarly for update-nth.
; It is perfectly appropriate for wrld to be nil if such extra
; information is not important.

; Note: The only reason we need the iff-flg is to let us translate (if
; x1 t x2) into (or x1 x2) when we are in an iff situation.  We could
; ask type-set to check that x1 is Boolean, but that would require
; passing wrld into untranslate.  That, in turn, would require passing
; wrld into such syntactic places as prettyify-clause and any other
; function that might want to print a term.

; Warning: This function may not terminate.  We should consider making it
; primitive recursive by adding a natural number ("count") parameter.

; Essay on Other Worlds

; In Version 1.7 and earlier, ev and its supporters were coded so that
; they took both a world and a state as input.  The world supplied the
; definitions of the functions.  The state was used for nothing but a
; termination argument -- but we did slip into raw Lisp when that was
; thought appropriate.  The code was was (supposed to be) sound when
; evaluated on states other than the live state.  This was imagined to
; be possible if ground calls of ev-fncall arose in terms being
; proved.  The raw lisp counterpart of ev verified that the world in
; the given state is properly related to the world in the live state.

; The following pre-Version 1.8 comment addresses concerns related to
; the evaluation of a fn in a world other than the one installed in
; state.  These comments are now outdated, but are left here because
; we gave the issue some careful thought at the time.

;   We wish to jump into Common Lisp to compute the value of fn on
;   args.  We know that fn is a function symbol in w because the guard
;   for ev requires that we only evaluate terms.  But the Common Lisp
;   state reflects the definitions of the currently installed world,
;   inst-w, while we have to compute fn by the definitions in world w.
;   In addition, we can use the Common Lisp code only if the guards
;   have been verified.  So we need to know two things: (a) that the
;   two worlds w and inst-w are in an appropriate relationship, and
;   (b) that the guards for fn are all satisfied.

;   We address (a) first.  It is clear that inst-w can be used to
;   compute fn in w if every function ancestral to fn in w is defined
;   exactly the same way in inst-w.  When this condition holds, we say
;   "inst-w is sufficient to compute fn in w."  This sufficiency
;   condition is too expensive to check explicitly.  Note, however,
;   that if inst-w is an extension of w, then inst-w is sufficient.
;   Note also that if w is an extension of inst-w and fn is defined in
;   inst-w, then inst-w is sufficient.  Now if w is an extension of
;   inst-w and fn is defined in w then it is defined in inst-w iff it
;   is fboundp.  Proof: Suppose fn is not defined in inst-w but is
;   fboundp.  Then fn is some function like RPLACA or LP.  But in that
;   case, fn couldn't be defined in w because to define it would
;   require that we smash its symbol-function.  Q.E.D.  So in fact, we
;   check that one of the two worlds is an extension of the other and
;   that fn is fboundp.

;   Now for (b).  We wish to check that the guards for fn are all
;   valid.  Of course, all we can do efficiently is see whether the
;   'guards-checked property has been set.  But it doesn't matter
;   which world we check that in because if the guards have been
;   checked in either then they are valid in both.  So we just see if
;   they have been checked in whichever of the two worlds is the
;   extension.

; Essay on Context-message Pairs

; Recall that translate returns state, which might be modified.  It can be
; useful to have a version of translate that does not return state, for example
; in development of a parallel version of the waterfall (Ph.D. research by
; David Rager ongoing in 2010).  Starting after Version_4.1, we provide a
; version of translate that does not return state.  More generally, we support
; an analogy of the "error triples" programming idiom: rather than passing
; around triples (mv erp val state), we pass around pairs (mv ctx msg), as
; described below.  If foo is a function that returns an error triple, we may
; introduce foo-cmp as the analogous function that returns a message pair.  We
; try to avoid code duplication, for example by using the wrapper
; cmp-to-error-triple.

; An error is indicated when the context (first) component of a context-message
; pair is non-nil.  There are two possibilities in this case.  The second
; component can be nil, indicating that the error does not cause a message to
; be printed.  Otherwise, the first component is a context suitable for er and
; such, while the second component is a message (fmt-string . fmt-args),
; suitable as a ~@ fmt argument.

; Essay on STOBJS-IN and STOBJS-OUT

; Once upon a time, before user-defined single-threaded objects came along,
; every function symbol had four aspects to its syntactic character:
; * its arity
; * which of its inputs was STATE
; * its multiplicity (how many results it returns)
; * which of its outputs was STATE
; These were coded on the property list in a somewhat optimized way involving
; the four properties FORMALS, STATE-IN, MULTIPLICITY, and STATE-OUT.  If
; STATE-IN was absent or NIL, then STATE was not a formal.  Otherwise, STATE-IN
; indicated the position (1-based) of STATE in the FORMALS.  If MULTIPLICITY
; was absent, it was implicitly 1.  If STATE-OUT was T then multiplicity was 1
; and STATE was the single result.  We review these old characteristics because
; they were generalized when we introduced single-threaded objects, or
; ``stobjs''.

; Since the introduction of stobjs, every function has four aspects to its
; syntactic character:

; * its arity
; * which of its inputs are stobjs
; * its multiplicity
; * which of its outputs are stobjs

; This is coded on the property list as follows.  First, a ``STOBJ flag'' is
; either NIL or the name of a stobj (including STATE).  A list of n STOBJ flags
; can thus indicate which elements of another list of length n are stobjs and
; which stobjs they are.

; FORMALS gives the list of formals.

; STOBJS-IN is a list of STOBJ flags that is interpreted in 1:1 correspondence
; with the formals.  Every function symbol must have a STOBJS-IN property.  We
; do not support space-efficient coding of any special cases.  Each formal must
; be the corresponding stobj.

; STOBJS-OUT is a list of stobj flags indicating both the multiplicity and
; which outputs are stobjs, and the correspondence between output stobjs and
; input stobjs.  For example, if the STOBJS-IN property is (nil $s1 $s2 nil)
; and the STOBJS-OUT property is (nil $s2), then two values are returned, where
; the second value returned is the same stobj as the third input (labeled $s2
; above).  Every function must have a STOBJS-OUT property, with the effective
; exception of return-last: an error is caused if the function stobjs-out is
; applied to return-last, which always returns its last argument (possibly a
; multiple value) and should generally be considered as not having STOBJS-OUT.

; We now consider translation performed on behalf of evaluation (as opposed to
; translating only for the logic, as when translating proposed theorems).
; During translation of each argument of a function call, we generally have a
; stobj flag associated with the term we are translating, indicating the
; expected stobj, if any, produced by the term.  Consider a stobj flag, $s,
; that is non-nil, i.e., is a stobj name.  Then the term occupying the
; corresponding slot MUST be the stobj name $s, except in the case that
; congruent stobjs are involved (see below).  We think of the stobj flags as
; meaning that the indicated stobj name is the only term that can be passed
; into that slot.

; We mentioned a relaxation above for the case of congruent stobjs.  (See :DOC
; defstobj for an introduction to congruent stobjs.)  Consider again a function
; call.  Each argument corresponding to a non-nil stobj flag should be
; a stobj that is congruent to that flag (a stobj).  Moreoever, no two such
; arguments may be the same.

; We turn now from translation to evaluation in the logic (i.e., with *1*
; functions that might or might not pass control to raw Lisp functions).

; Our stobj primitives are all capable of computing on the logical objects that
; represent stobjs.  But they give special treatment to the live ones.  There
; are two issues.  First, we do not want a live one ever to get into a
; non-stobj slot because the rest of the functions do not know how to handle
; it.  So if the actual is a live stobj, the formal must be a stobj.  Second,
; if the ith element of STOBJS-IN is a stobj, $s, and the jth element of
; STOBJS-OUT is also $s, and the ith actual of a call is a live stobj, then the
; jth return value from that call is that same live stobj.  This is the only
; way that a live stobj can be found in the output (unless there is a call of a
; creator function, which is untouchable).

(defun compute-stobj-flags (lst known-stobjs w)

; This function is used both in the definition of the stobj-let macro and, in
; translate11, to translate stobj-let forms.  This function is not responsible
; for all error checking, as some checks take place in translate11, which must
; ensure that x and its oneification will execute correctly.  Nevertheless, the
; error checking done in this function is useful for giving feedback on misuses
; of stobj-let in contexts such as theorems in which translate11 will not
; insist on correctness for execution, such as single-threadedness.  Of course,
; users who have a specific reason for "misusing" stobj-let in such contexts
; are welcome to avoid stobj-let and write let-expressions instead.

; X is a stobj-let form.  We return (mv erp bound-vars actuals stobj
; producer-vars producer updaters corresponding-accessor-fns consumer), where
; erp is either a msg or nil, and when erp is nil:
; - bound-vars is a list of symbols, without duplicates;
; - actuals is a corresponding list of untranslated field accessors;
; - stobj is the stobj accessed by those field accessors;
; - producer-vars is the true-list of producer variables
; - producer is an untranslated expression that returns values corresponding to
;   producer-vars;
; - updaters is a list of stobj updaters, obtained from producer-vars, actuals,
;   and any updaters specified explicitly in the first argument of the
;   stobj-let;
; - corresponding-accessor-fns is a list of accessor functions that corresponds
;   positionally to updaters; and
; - consumer is an expression that provides the return value(s).

; For example, if x is

;   (stobj-let
;    ((st1 (fld1 st+))
;     (st2 (fld2 st+) update-fld2)
;     (st3 (fld3i 4 st+)))

; Should we allow trans-eval under a stobj-let?  We decided not to, for two

; reference (which in the trans-eval case is to the value in the
; *user-stobj-alist*, not to the value bound by a superior stobj-let); and
; second, difficulty in getting the implementation right!  The following
; example illustrates how trans-eval would operate, were we to allow it in such
; a circumstance.  Note that the trans-eval call below updates the global
; stobj, sub1, not the locally bound sub1 that is a field of top1.

;   (defstobj sub1 sub1-fld1)

;      ((sub1 (top1-fld top1)))

;      (mv-let (erp val state)

;   ; NOTE: The reference to sub1 inside the following trans-eval call is
;   ; actually a reference to the global sub1 from the *user-stobj-alist*, not
;   ; to the sub1 bound by stobj-let above.
;
;              (trans-eval `(update-sub1-fld1 ',x sub1) 'my-top state t)
;              (declare (ignore erp val))
;              (mv sub1 state))

; Thus, in the code below, we bind the live var for each bound stobj so that we
; will get the error "It is illegal to run ACL2 evaluators...." when attempting
; to call trans-eval (as trans-eval calls ev-for-trans-eval, which calls
; user-stobj-alist-safe, which calls chk-user-stobj-alist, which checks the
; global *user-stobj-alist* against the live stobj values).

; Another reason to bind the-live-stobj is in case we need to print the stobj
; during guard violations or tracing, in which case we can distinguish it from
; the global stobj with the same name.  See for example stobj-print-symbol,
; which is used during tracing.

; Warning: Keep this in sync with macroexpand1*-cmp.

; Bindings is an alist binding symbols either to their corresponding
; STOBJS-OUT or to symbols.  The only symbols used are (about-to-be
; introduced) function symbols or the keyword :STOBJS-OUT.  When fn is
; bound to gn it means we have determined that the STOBJS-OUT of fn is
; that of gn.  We allow fn to be bound to itself -- indeed, it is
; required initially!  (This allows bindings to double as a recording
; of all the names currently being introduced.)

; Stobjs-out is one of:

; t              - meaning we do not care about multiple-value or stobj
;                  restrictions (as when translating proposed theorems).
; (s1 s2 ... sk) - a list of 1 or more stobj flags indicating where stobjs
;                  are returned in the translation of x
; fn             - a function name, indicating that we are trying to deduce
;                  the stobjs-out setting for fn from some output branch, x,
;                  of its body, as we translate.  We also enforce prohibitions
;                  against the use of DEFUN, IN-PACKAGE, etc inside bodies.
; :stobjs-out    - like a function name, except we know we are NOT in a defun
;                  body and allow DEFUN, IN-PACKAGE, etc., but restrict certain
;                  calls of return-last.

; See the essay on STOBJS-IN and STOBJS-OUT, above.

; When stobjs-out is a symbol, it must be dereferenced through bindings
; before using it.  [One might think that we follow the convention of keeping
; it dereferenced, e.g., by using the new value whenever we bind it.
; But that is hard since the binding may come deep in some recursive
; call of translate.]

; T always deferences to t and nothing else dereferences to t.  So you
; can check (eq stobjs-out t) without dereferencing to know whether we
; care about the stobjs-out conditions.

; Known-stobjs is a subset of the list of all stobjs known in world wrld (but
; may contain some NIL elements, to be ignored; see "slight abuse" comment in
; chk-acceptable-defuns1) or else known-stobjs is T and denotes all the stobjs
; in wrld.  A name is considered a stobj iff it is in known-stobjs.  This
; allows us to implement the :STOBJS declaration in defuns, by which the user
; can declare the stobjs in a function.

; The cform argument is a form that provides context -- it is the one to be
; printed by trans-er+ when there isn't another obvious contextual form to
; print.  (Often x carries enough context.)

; Keep this in sync with oneify.

; the documentation for syntaxp and bind-free as appropriate.  But before
; making such a change, consider this: no live user-defined stobj will ever

; (1) stobjs-out must be either t, nil, or list of stobj flags.
;     It CANNOT be a function name (``an unknown'').
; (2) If stobjs-out is nil, it is treated as though it were a list of
;     nils as long as lst.

; If stobjs-out is t, we translate each element of lst (with stobjs-out t)
; and return the resulting list.

; If stobjs-out is not t, it is a list of stobj flags as long as lst.
; We consider each element, x, of list in correspondence with each
; flag, flg.  If flg is nil, we insist that the translation of x
; return one non-stobj result.  If flg is a stobj, we insist that x BE
; flg -- except that x ``is'' a stobj, flg, only if x is flg and x is
; among known-stobjs (with proper treatment of known-stobjs = t).

; Msg is used to describe the form that contains the list, lst, of
; forms being translated.  It is only used if an error is caused when
; some element of lst violates the stobj restrictions of stobjs-out.
; If msg is nil, no allusion to the containing form is made.  If msg
; is a symbol, we describe the containing form as though it were a
; call of that function symbol.  Otherwise, we print msg with ~@ in
; ``the form x is being used, @msg, where a stobj...''.

; The cform argument is a form that provides context -- it is the one to be
; printed by trans-er+ when there isn't another obvious contextual form to
; print.  (Often x carries enough context.)

; See also translate1 for a corresponding version that also returns state.

; Stobjs-out should be t, a proper STOBJS-OUT setting, a function symbol, or
; the symbol :stobjs-out.

; Stobjs-out t means we do not enforce mv-let or stobjs restrictions.  A proper
; STOBJS-OUT setting (a list of stobj flags) enforces the given restrictions.
; A function symbol means we enforce the rules and determine the stobjs-out,
; binding the symbol in the returned bindings alist.  In addition, a function
; symbol tells us we are in a definition body and enforce certain rules
; prohibiting calls of functions like DEFUN and IN-PACKAGE.  The symbol
; :stobjs-out -- which is not a function symbol -- has the same meaning as a
; function symbol except that it tells us we are NOT processing a definition
; body.  As is noted below, if the initial stobjs-out is :stobjs-out, bindings
; MUST be '((:stobjs-out . :stobjs-out)) and we use (eq (caar bindings)
; :stobjs-out) to determine that we are not in a definition.

; CAUTION: If you call this function with stobjs-out being a symbol, say fn,
; make sure that

; (a) fn is bound to itself in bindings, e.g., bindings = ((fn . fn)), and
; (b) fn is not an existing function name in w, in particular, it must not have
;     a STOBJS-OUT setting, since that is what we use fn to compute.

; In general, bindings is a list of pairs, one for each fn in the clique being
; introduced, and each is initially bound to itself.  If a function symbol is
; not bound in bindings, its STOBJS-OUT is obtained from w.

; Known-stobjs is either a list of stobj names (but may contain some NIL
; elements, to be ignored; see "slight abuse" comment in
; chk-acceptable-defuns1) or T (meaning, all stobj names in world w).  A name
; is considered a stobj only if it is in this list.

; State-vars is a state-vars record, typically (default-state-vars t) unless
; one does not have state available, and then (default-state-vars nil).

; We return (mv erp transx bindings), where transx is the translation and
; bindings has been modified to bind every fn (ultimately) to a proper stobjs
; out setting.  Use translate-deref to recover the bindings.

; This case can happen because x is the call of a non-executable function.  We

; A Note on the Reason this Function Exists:

; This function is a cousin of trans-eval that is much easier to use
; in simple cases.  Trans-eval can handle any well-formed term.  Thus,
; it must have a way to communicate to the caller how many results are
; being returned and what they are.  The obvious thing for trans-eval
; to do is to list the results.  But if one of them is STATE or some
; other stobj, it cannot.  So trans-eval has a rather complicated
; interface that permits the caller to determine the mulitplicity of
; the result and whether and where the stobjs appear (or, more precisely,
; are supposed to appear) in the output vector.  See the documentation
; of trans-eval for its specification.

; This function, simple-translate-and-eval, is designed to handle more
; simply the most common case, namely, when x is supposed to be a term
; that returns one result and that result is not state or any other
; stobj.  In that case, we can return the result directly.

; While trans-eval may be used whenever translation and evaluation are
; needed, we recommend using simple-translate-and-eval if the given
; term returns a single, non-stobj result, simply because the
; interface is simpler.

; The Spec of SIMPLE-TRANSLATE-AND-EVAL: We translate x, requiring
; that it be a term that returns one non-stobj result.  We verify that
; the translation mentions no variables other than those bound in
; alist and the stobj names listed in ok-stobj-names.  We then
; evaluate the translation of x under alist', where alist' is obtained
; from alist by appending the bindings of 'state to state and
; (user-stobj-alist state).  (The extra bindings can't hurt.  The
; bindings of alist have priority.)  If no errors arise, we return a
; pair, (term .  val), where term is the translation of x and val is
; its value under alist'.

; Msg is a ~@ message that should describe x and begin with a capital
; letter.  For example, msg might be the string "The second argument
; to foo".

; Note that we call translate with logic-modep nil.  Thus, :program
; mode functions may appear in x.

; Keep in sync with simple-translate-and-eval@par.

  (er-let* ((term (translate x '(nil) nil t ctx wrld state)))

; known-stobjs = t.  We expect simple-translate-and-eval to be used
; only when the user is granted full access to the stobjs in state
