; Essay on the APPLY$ Integration

; For an explanation of the logical foundations of apply$, see the paper
; ``Limited Second Order Functionality in a First Order Setting''.  We assume
; here that you are familiar with that paper and the terminology it uses.

; The basic logical development of apply$ proceeds in three steps: (i) defining
; apply$-prim, etc., to interpret built-in symbols like CONS and BINARY-+, (ii)
; constraining badge-userfn and apply$-userfn which will be connected to
; user-defined functions via warrants, and (iii) defining badge, tamep, apply$,
; and defwarrant in terms of the functions in (i) and (ii).

; The paper above explains how an ordinary certified book could be used to
; introduce apply$ into an ACL2 without native support for apply$ -- with one
; ``minor'' exception.  Indeed, that is how apply$ was developed (during the
; period 2015-2017 with ACL2 Versions 7.2 through 7.4).  Each of the three
; steps was carried out in its own certified book, appropriately named
; apply-prim, apply-constraints (aka ``constraints''), and apply.  We preserved
; that file basic structure when we integrated apply$ into the ACL2 source
; code.

; The ``minor'' exception noted above is that without native support it is
; impossible to execute apply$: apply$-userfn is constrained.  Only by
; implicitly assuming warrants can apply$ run a user-defined function, and the
; implicit extension of the ``evaluation theory'' to include all warrants
; required changes to ACL2 itself.  Our desire to support execution naturally
; meant we had to make those changes and upon completion of that integration
; task we named the resulting ACL2 Version_8.0.

; Ground apply$ terms can only be executed at the top-level because execution
; implicitly assumes warrants.  Conservativity forces us to require that
; warrants be explicit in proofs.  Thus, execution of apply$ is via attachments
; to badge-userfn and apply$-userfn and the concrete functions used must be
; built into ACL2's sources since they must ``magically'' determine whether the
; corresponding function symbols have warrants in the current world.

; Below is a guide to the files primarily related to the integration of apply$
; into our source code.  Of course, the name ``APPLY$'' and related symbols are
; sprinkled throughout the ACL2 source files now, e.g., in
; *initial-logic-fns-with-raw-code*, but these are the main files and books
; and we list them in four groups explained below.

; Foundations:
;  books/projects/apply-model/
;    apply-prim.lisp
;    apply-constraints.lisp
;    apply.lisp
;    ex1/*
;    ex2/*

; Source Code:
;  other-events.lisp
;  apply-prim.lisp
;  apply-constraints.lisp
;  apply.lisp
;  apply-raw.lisp

; Bootstrapping:
;  books/system/apply/apply-prim.lisp
;  books/system/apply/apply-constraints.lisp
;  books/system/apply/apply.lisp

; User:
;  books/projects/apply/base.lisp
;  books/projects/apply/report.lisp

; * The Foundations Group preserves the original construction of apply$ by
; defining it exactly as in the paper ``Limited Second Order Functionality in a
; First Order Setting'' but in a different symbol package (since functions of
; those names are now defined in ACL2).  The subdirectories ex1/ and ex2/
; illustrate the claim (proved in the paper) that for any set of functions
; accepted by defwarrant it is possible to define badge-userfn and
; apply$-userfn so that all warrants are valid.  We regard the Foundation books
; as a historic record and thus static; the books correspond to the paper.

; * The Source Code Group contains the five files that introduce apply$, et al,
; into the source code.  The first one listed above, other-events.lisp, just
; introduces two partially constrained functions, doppelganger-badge-userfn and
; doppelganger-apply$-userfn, that play a role in the implementation of the
; evaluation theory for apply$.  We do not discuss that file further here since
; it is overwhelmingly concerned with events not related to apply$, but we
; discuss the concrete functions extensively in apply-raw.lisp.

; The next three files, apply-prim, apply-constraints, and apply, correspond to
; their Foundations counterparts except they only contain the defuns and
; constraints but not the machinery needed to prove termination and guards.

; The fourth, apply-raw, defines the ``magic'' concrete functions that will be
; attached to badge-userfn and apply$-userfn to enable top-level execution of
; apply$.  It also implements a fast version of apply$-lambda that involves
; compilation and a cache.  And finally, perhaps incongruously, it includes, at
; the very end, a 1500 line Essay on Admitting a Model for Apply$ and the
; Functions that Use It.  That essay is mentioned in the above cited paper,
; ``Limited Second Order Functionality in a First Order Setting,'' which
; explains that we can can build a model of apply$ and all warranted functions
; so that all warrants are valid, but the paper only sketches the proof that
; the model can be admitted.  The essay contains the full proof.

; At the time apply$ was integrated (Version_8.0) the relevant definitions in
; the Source Code Group files were the same (modulo some bootstrapping issues
; noted below) as their counterparts in the Foundations files.  However, over
; time we imagine the support for apply$ in ACL2 will go beyond what is
; described in the paper, e.g., we might enlarge or shrink the set of
; primitives, extend the syntactic class of tame expressions, or make
; defwarrant able to handle mutual recursion.

; * The Bootstrapping Group contains the definitions of the Source Code group
; but also contains the measures and other machinery needed to prove
; termination and guards.  For example, the apply$ clique in the Foundations
; group is justified by a well-founded lexicographic relation, but such
; relations are not available in ACL2 until after the ordinals/ books have been
; certified.  So apply$ cannot be admitted in the Source Code group the way it
; was in the Foundations group.  Similar problems are encountered several times
; during the build of ACL2, specifically when the :acl2-devel feature is set.
; For documentation of the acl2-devel process, see :DOC
; verify-guards-for-system-functions, or see the comment in source constant
; *system-verify-guards-alist*.

; (The basic story is that we first introduce such functions in :program
; mode, build an ``:acl2-devel'' image of the system, redundantly define the
; functions we wish to upgrade in various systems/ books, certify all those
; systems/ books with the :acl2-devel image, check that the data in
; *system-verify-guards-alist* is justified by the books just certified, and
; then build the public image of ACL2 in which we trustingly use
; *system-verify-guards-alist* to assert that the functions terminate and are
; guard verified.  The books in the Bootstrapping group must track the
; definitions in the Source Code group: changing one without the changing the
; other will probably result in the failure of the :acl2-devel certification of
; the system/ books.)

; * The User Group contains lemmas and examples that will probably be of value
; to ACL2 users wishing to prove things about functions that use apply$.

; End of Essay on the APPLY$ Integration

; The Maximal Defun of Apply$-Prim

; We define *apply$-primitives*, apply$-primp, and apply$-prim to include
; almost all functions in the bootstrap world that could have badges.  We
; intentionally skip a few problematic or silly primitives, like wormhole1
; which has some syntactic restrictions on how it can be called -- restrictions
; that would complicate or confuse any attempt to apply$ 'wormhole1.

; Historical Note: Before apply$ was integrated over 800 symbols satisfied
; apply$-primp.  After integration, that number dropped to slightly fewer than
; 800 because at the time this file is processed as part of the build not quite
; all primitives have been introduced.  (Indeed, this is one of the reasons we
; process this file rather late in the build.)  As a consequence, we have
; changed occurrences of ``800+'' to ``~800'' and recognize that the exact
; number may vary as the sources and build process change.
