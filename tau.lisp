(in-package "ACL2")

; In this file we define the Tau system, a collection of data structures and
; algorithms for reasoning quickly about monadic predicates.  However, we need
; certain basic facilities from the rest of ACL2's sources and we have put them
; all in the following ``prelude.''  See the Essay on the Tau System below for
; a discussion of the tau design.

; Prelude:  General-Purpose Functions Having Nothing Specific to do with Tau

; A ``singleton evg list'' is a singleton list with an evg in it.  A ``neg-evg
; list'' is a duplicate-free list of singleton evg lists, ordered ascending
; almost according to lexorder.  The ``almost'' is due to the fact that we let
; the singleton list containing NIL be the smallest thing in our ordering.  So
; a typical neg-evg list might be ((NIL) (0) (1) (2) (A) (B) (C)).
; Foreshadowing: a neg-evg list represents the evgs ruled out by a tau.  If a
; tau were to contain the neg-evgs above, then the tau would include the
; conjuncts (not (equal x 'NIL)), (not (equal x '0)), ..., and (not (equal x
; 'C)).  We want NIL in the front so that we can rapidly answer the question
; ``does this tau mean the subject is non-NIL?''

; We define the ``almost-lexorder'' function as well as functions for
; determining whether a singleton is a member of a neg-evg list and for
; inserting a singleton into such a list.  These functions are optimized
; exploiting the fact that every item compared is known to be a singleton, so
; instead of using lexorder on (x) and (y) we use it on x and y, i.e., we
; always compare just the cars of the lists.

(defun almost-lexorder-singletons (x y)
  (cond ((eq (car x) nil) t)
        ((eq (car y) nil) nil)
        (t (lexorder (car x) (car y)))))

; We actually don't use almost-lexorder-singletons in the membership and
; insertion functions because we make special cases for nil.

; In forming rules from terms we often strip out individual branches of the

; except after distributing the IMPLIES over the concluding ANDs, we do not
; form a term but just traffic in list of pairs (((h1 h2) . c1) ((h1 h2 h3)
; . c2)).  This is called ``unprettyifying.''

(defun unprettyify/add-hyps-to-pairs (hyps lst)

(defun unprettyify (term)

; This function returns a list of pairs (hyps . concl) such that the
; conjunction of all (implies (and . hyps) concl) is equivalent to
; term.  Hyps is a list of hypotheses, implicitly conjoined.  Concl
; does not begin with an AND (of course, its a macro, but concl
; doesn't begin with an IF that represents an AND) or IMPLIES.
; In addition concl doesn't begin with an open lambda.

; This function is used to extract the :REWRITE rules from a term.
; Lambdas are sort of expanded to expose the conclusion.  They are not
; expanded in the hypotheses, or within an function symbol other than
; the top-level IFs and IMPLIES.  But top-level lambdas (those enclosing
; the entire term) are blown away.

; Thus, if you have a proposed :REWRITE rule
;    (implies (and p q) (let ((x a)) (equal (f x) b)))
; it will be converted to
;    (implies (and p q) (equal (f a) b)).
; The rule
;    (let ((x a)) (implies (and (p x) (q x)) (equal (f x) b))) [1]
; will become
;    (implies (and (p a) (q a)) (equal (f a) b)).              [2]
; But
;    (implies (let ((x a)) (and (p x) (q x)))                  [3]
;             (equal (let ((x a)) (f x)) b))
; stays untouched.  In general, once you've moved the let into a
; hypothesis it is not seen or opened.  Once you move it into the
; equivalence relation of the conclusion it is not seen or opened.
; Note that this processing of lambdas can cause terms to be duplicated
; and simplified more than once (see a in [2] compared to [3]).

; Rockwell Addition:  A major change is the removal of THEs from
; many terms.

; Essay on the Removal of Guard Holders

; We now develop the code to remove certain trivial calls, such as those
; generated by THE, from a term.  Suppose for example that the user types (THE
; type expr); type is translated (using translate-declaration-to-guard) into a
; predicate in one variable.  The variable is always VAR.  Denote this
; predicate as (guard VAR).  Then the entire form (THE type expr) is translated
; into ((LAMBDA (VAR) (THE-CHECK (guard VAR) 'type VAR)) expr).  The-check is
; defined to have a guard that logically is its first argument, so when we
; generate guards for the translation above we generate the obligation to prove
; (guard expr).  Furthermore, the definition of the-check is such that unless
; the value of state global 'guard-checking-on is :none, executing it in the
; *1* function tests (guard expr) at runtime and signals an error.

; But logically speaking, the definition of (THE-check g x y) is y.  Hence,
;   (THE type expr)
; = ((LAMBDA (VAR) (THE-check (guard VAR) 'type VAR)) expr)
; = ((LAMBDA (VAR) VAR) expr)
; = expr.
; Observe that this is essentially just the expansion of certain non-rec
; functions (namely, THE-CHECK and the lambda application) and
; IF-normalization.

; We belabor this obvious point because until Version_2.5, we kept the THEs in
; bodies, which injected them into the theorem proving process.  We now remove
; them from the stored BODY property.  It is not obvious that this is a benign
; change; it might have had unintended side-effects on other processing, e.g.,
; guard generation.  But the BODY property has long been normalized with
; certain non-rec fns expanded, and so we argue that the removal of THE could
; have been accomplished by the processing we were already doing.

; But there is another place we wish to remove such ``guard holders.''  We want
; the guard clauses we generate not to have these function calls in them.  The
; terms we explore to generate the guards WILL have these calls in them.  But
; the output we produce will not, courtesy of the following code which is used
; to strip the guard holders out of a term.

; Starting with Version_2.8 the ``guard holders'' code appears elsewhere,
; because remove-guard-holders needs to be defined before it is called by
; constraint-info.

(defun remove-guard-holders1 (changedp0 term ilk wrld)

; Warning: If you change this function, consider changing :DOC guard-holders.

; We return (mv changedp new-term), where new-term is provably equal to term,
; and where if changedp is nil, then changedp0 is nil and new-term is identical
; to term.  The second part can be restated as follows: if changedp0 is true
; then changedp is true (a kind of monotonicity), and if the resulting term is
; distinct from the input term then changedp is true.  Intuitively, if changedp
; is true then new-term might be distinct from term but we don't know that
; (especially if changedp0 is true), but if changedp is nil then we know that
; new-term is just term.

; Note: wrld is normally a world, but may be nil, in which case ilk is ignored
; and thus guard holders are not removed from quoted lambdas.  Use nil for wrld
; when the notion of provable equality of the input and output terms must not
; rely on how quoted lambdas are handled in ilk = :fn (or :fn?) argument
; positions.

; See the Essay on the Removal of Guard Holders.

; WARNING: The resulting term is in quote normal form.  We take advantage of
; this fact in our implementation of :by hints, in function
; apply-top-hints-clause1, to increase the chances that the "easy-winp" case
; holds.  We also take advantage of this fact in
; interpret-term-as-rewrite-rule, as commented there.

; WARNING.  Remove-guard-holders is used in
; induction-machine-for-fn1, and termination-machine, so (remove-guard-holders1
; term ilk w) needs to be provably equal to term, for every term and suitable
; ilk, in the ground-zero theory.  In fact, because of the use in
; constraint-info, it needs to be the case that for any axiomatic event e,
; (remove-guard-holders e w) can be substituted for e without changing the
; logical power of the set of axioms.  Actually, we want to view the logical
; axiom added by e as though remove-guard-holders had been applied to it, and
; hence RETURN-LAST, MV-LIST, and CONS-WITH-HINT appear in
; *non-instantiable-primitives*.

(defrec type-set-inverter-rule ((nume . ts) terms . rune) nil)

; A type-set-inverter-rule states that x has type-set ts iff the conjunction of
; terms{X/x} is true.  Thus, for example, if :ts is *ts-integer* then :terms is
; '((INTEGERP X)).

; WARNING:  See the warning in convert-type-set-to-term if you are ever
; tempted to generalize type-set-inverter-rules to allow hypotheses that
; may be FORCEd or CASE-SPLITd!

; A type-set, s, is a disjunction of the individual bits in it.  Thus, to
; create a term whose truth is equivalent to the claim that X has type-set s it
; is sufficient to find any type-set-inverter-rule whose :ts is a subset of s
; and then disjoin the :term of that rule to the result of recursively creating
; the term recognizing s minus :ts.  This assumes one has a rule for each
; single type bit.

; The following is the initial setting of the world global variable
; 'type-set-inverter-rules.  WARNING: EACH TERM IN :TERMS MUST BE IN TRANSLATED
; FORM.  The list is ordered in an important way: the larger type-sets are at
; the front.  This ordering is exploited by convert-type-set-to-term-lst which
; operates by finding the largest recognized type set group and knocks it out
; of the type set.

;; Historical Comment from Ruben Gamboa:
;; I added a rule for realp, non-zero real, non-negative real,
;; non-positive real, positive real, negative real, irrational,
;; negative irrational, positive irrational, and complex.

; equivalent, in w, to "x has type set ts".

; E.g., if x is the term (FN X Y) and ts is *ts-rational* then our output will
; be (RATIONALP (FN X Y)), whether flg is t or nil.  We return (mv term ttree),
; where term is the term and ttree contains the 'lemmas used.  We do not use
; disabled type-set-inverters.

; The only time flg matters is the case that flg is true, term is known to be
; Boolean, and ts is *ts-t*.  In that case we return x instead of the provably
; equivalent (equal x 'T).  If you're trying to explain or show what a type-set
; means, you need to use flg = nil.  But if you're trying to assume or prove
; that x has the given type-set, you may use flg = t.  See the comment where
; flg is used below for an explanation of why this feature matters.

; Note: This function is just a helper function for convert-type-set-to-term.
; That function is called in several places in the ACL2 code and in a couple of
; books.  To save the bother of changing those calls, we named this function
; convert-type-set-to-term1.  Convert-type-set-to-term calls it with flg=nil.
; The only place that this function is called directly (and with flg=t) is
; clausify-type-alist, which is used by clausify-assumption.

; Note:  It would be a major change to make this function force assumptions.
; If the returned ttree contains 'assumption tags then the primary use of
; this function, namely the expression of type-alists in clausal form so that
; assumptions can be attacked as clauses, becomes problematic.  Don't glibly
; generalize type-set-inverter rules to force assumptions.

; We commented out this case for Version_3.5 because of a soundness issue that
; no longer exists (because we don't create type-prescription rules for

; commented out because we thought it was an unimportant case that hasn't been
; missed.  But, while working with Version_6.4, we encountered a proof in a
; script from Warren Hunt that sped up from 77 seconds to 16 seconds when
; including this case.  That script generated a lot of forced assumptions, and
; this code is responsible for creating the clauses proved in the forcing
; round.  In particular, if a lemma is forced in a context in which one of the
; governing assumptions is (< alpha beta), then that assumption is encoded as
; (equal (< alpha beta) t) in the clause attacked by the forcing round -- if
; those clauses are generated by the code in Version_3.5 through Version_6.4,
; i.e., if flg=nil.  But that means the inequality is hidden until the EQUAL is
; rewritten, delaying, for example, tau.  In the Hunt script, tau can prove the
; clauses generated with flg = t.  So, after Version_6.4 we restored this case,
; conditional on flg.

; On Tau-Like Terms

; The Tau system is a collection of data structures and algorithms for
; reasoning quickly about the things we know to be true about a term.  It was
; motivated by our frustration over the time it took ACL2 to do elementary
; guard-like proofs -- ``proofs'' that could be almost instantaneous in a
; strongly typed language.  A tau is a representation of a set of ``tau
; recognizers'' denoting the function obtained by conjoining the recognizers.
; To say that e has a given tau is to say that the function denoted by the tau
; is true of e.  Informally, ``the'' tau of a term is all the tau-like things
; we know to be true about the term.  The tau recognizers include all the named
; Boolean functions of one argument, their negations, and all the functions
; (lambda (x) (EQUAL x '<evg>)) and (lambda (x) (< x '<evg>)), and their
; negations.

; On the Name ``tau''

; ``Tau'' might stand for ``Types Are Unnecessary'' and if it did the name
; would be ironic because this whole idea is a tribute to type checking!  The
; truth is that ``tau'' doesn't stand for anything!  When we designed this
; system we needed a name for the meta objects denoting the set of monadic
; predicates (``signed tau recognizers'') that we know to hold about a term in
; a given context.

; We were tempted to call such a set a ``type'' of the term but felt that was
; inappropriate because the literature on types is so extensive and we have no
; interest in defending the proposition that our objects are ``types''.  We
; really don't think of them as anything more than sets of recognizers known
; known to be true.  We could not use the words ``sorts'' or ``kinds'' for
; similar reasons.  So we temporarily adopted the name ``recognizer sets''
; abbreviated ``rs.''  But this was an unfortunate acronym for two reasons:
; typically pronounced ``are ess'' it was unclear whether to write ``given an
; rs'' or ``given a rs'' since the former ``sounds right'' when ``rs'' is
; pronounced ``are ess'' but wrong when ``rs'' is read ``recognizer set.''
; Furthermore, is ``rs'' singular or plural?  Did we really want to write
; ``Given a set of rses?''  Nevertheless, we got this idea working, in a
; stand-alone way, under the name rs.  Only when it was integrated into ACL2
; proper did adopt the name ``tau'' for these objects.  We chose ``tau''
; because it had no fixed connotation in the literature, it is short, and it
; started with a pronounced consonant.  We use ``tau'' as both a singular noun
; and a plural one.  We might say ``t1 is a tau'' and we might say that the
; ``tau of x and y are t1 and t2 respectively''.

; On Some Basic Ideas

; We identify certain expressions as primitive ``tau recognizers'' and then
; develop a data structure, tau, to represent conjunctions of these tau
; recognizers.  Speaking precisely in the language of metamathematics, tau
; recognizers and tau are predicates in the semantic sense.  In particular in
; ACL2's terms, they represent not function SYMBOLS or TERMS but FUNCTIONS.
; They can be applied to any single object and yield T or NIL to indicate
; whether the object has the property or not.  For example, we might wish to
; express the property of being a natural number between 1 and 7, or of being
; an alist mapping 32-bit integers to 32-bit integers.  The whole idea of the
; tau system is that by representing primitive tau recognizers as objects and
; allowing the representation of the conjunction and negation of these objects
; we can precompute the implications of some thing having a given property
; independently of whatever thing we might be talking about.

; This leads to another basic idea in the tau system: these precomputed
; relationships between tau properties are stored in a database, so that upon
; learning that an object has one of the properties we can rapidly determine
; all of the tau recognizers it satisfies.

; A third basic idea is that the tau database will not be deduced
; automatically but will be derived from rules proved by the user.  The tau
; system mines rules as they are proved and builds its database.  Several
; forms of theorems are of interest.

; Boolean:
; (booleanp (f v))

; Eval:
; (p 'const)

; Simple:
; (implies (p v) (q v))

; Conjunctive:
; (implies (and (p1 v) (p2 v) ...) (q v))

; On Tau Recognizers -- Part 1

; So what are the tau recognizers?  They are the following functions:

; (i)   named, monadic Boolean, non-constant functions, both built-in and
;       defined, such as NATP, INTEGERP, CONSP, ALISTP, etc., including
;       user-defined ones, and their negations, e.g., (lambda (x) (NOT (NATP
;       x))); see what we mean by ``non-constant, non-equality'' below.

; (ii)  all functions (lambda (x) (EQUAL x 'evg)) and their negations,
;       where we also accept EQ, EQL, and = in place of EQUAL, and

; (iii) all functions (lambda (x) (< x '<evg>)) or (lambda (x) (< '<evg> x)),
;       for rational <evg>, and their negations, where we also accept > in
;       place of <.  Note that <= and >= are ACL2 macros, not function symbols,
;       so there is no point in accepting them.  When mining ACL2 terms for tau
;       recognizers (i.e., tau-like-term) and encountering (> x y), we act as
;       though we'd just seen (< y x).

; If sign is T or NIL and r is a tau recognizer, then by sign/r we mean r if
; sign is T and the negation of r of sign is NIL.  Think of the positive sign
; being T and the negative sign being NIL.  Thus, (sign/r e) is (NOT (EQUAL e
; 'ABC)) if sign is NIL and r is (lambda (x) (EQUAL x 'ABC)).

; The Non-Constant Non-Equality Premise: No function symbol is defined or
; constrained to be constantly T or constantly NIL, and no function symbol is
; defined or constrained to be equivalent to (EQUAL v 'evg) or (NOT (EQUAL v
; 'evg)).  Thus, we don't expect to handle functions like:

; (defun everywhere-true (x) (declare (ignore x)) T)

; or

; (defun is-loadp (x) (eq x 'LOAD))

; A user wishing to test equality-with-constant should use EQUAL (or one of its
; variants) and the constant, not hide it inside a monadic Boolean function.
; Our code is sound in the presence of such pathological defuns, but it is not
; ``as complete'' as it would be if they were avoided.  These restrictions
; could be dropped by extending the form of Synonym theorems so that the tau
; system understood these symbols.  But equalities like (eq x 'LOAD) are so
; useful it is hard to make sure the rest of the theorem prover is aware of
; them except by leaving them out in the open.

; One implication of the Non-Constant Non-Equality Premise is that we will
; never see (or in any case, take no note of) theorems of the form (fn x) -->
; (equal x 'evg), because such a theorem implies that fn violates the premise.

; (encapsulate ((fn (x) t))
;              (local (defun fn (x) (equal x '23)))
;              (defthm fn-constraint (and (booleanp (fn x))
;                                         (implies (fn x) (equal x '23)))
;                :rule-classes nil))
; (thm (or (equal (fn x) nil)
;          (equal (fn x) (equal x '23)))
;      :hints (("Goal" :use fn-constraint)))

; We discuss how tau recognizers are represented in our code in ``On Tau
; Recognizers -- Part 2'' below.

; On the Tau Database and General Design

; It is possible to turn the tau reasoning engine on or off, by toggling the
; enabled status of the rune for TAU-SYSTEM.

; Our design allows for theorems to enter the tau database in either of two
; ways, explicitly (because they have rule-classes :tau-system) or implicitly
; (because they are of the right syntactic shape).  Non-:tau-system theorems
; are swept up into the database implicitly only when the tau system is in
; ``automatic mode.''

; The two modes just mentioned -- whether tau reasoning is used in proofs
; and whether the tau database is extended implicitly -- are independent.

; The tau system does not track the rules it uses.  This design decision was
; motivated by the desire to make tau reasoning fast.  The tau database does
; not record which tau facts come from which theorems or runes.  It is
; impossible to prevent tau from using a fact in the database unless you
; disable TAU-SYSTEM altogether.  However, there is a facility for regenerating
; the tau database with respect to a given enabled structure.

; Thus, the tau database may be built incrementally as each event is processed
; or may be built in one fell swoop.  In the early implementations of the tau
; system the various modes and features were scattered all over our source
; code.  For example, we found ourselves possibly extending the tau database:
; (a) when :tau-system rules are added by add-x-rule
; (b) when any non-:tau-system rule is added (e.g., by add-rewrite-rule)
; (c) when a defun or constraint added a Boolean type-prescription rule to
;     a monadic function
; (d) when an explicit regenerate event is triggered.

; This became too complicated.  We have therefore moved all the tau database
; extension code into this file and invoke it only two places: in install-event
; and in the regeneration event (which mimics the sequential invocation on
; successive events in the world).

; One odd aspect of this implementation is that add-x-rule, which ``ought'' to
; know how to add every kind of rule class, does NOT add :tau-system rules.
; Instead, it is just a quiet no-op on :tau-system rules and those rules are
; handled by the centralized tau facility developed here.  To do otherwise
; would mean that :tau-system rules must be added both by add-x-rule and by
; regeneration of the tau database.

; Another oddity is that it is difficult to check that certain ``syntactic''
; criteria are met because the criteria are really dependent on previously
; proved and exported theorems.  For example, if p and q are monadic Boolean
; functions,

; (defthm p-implies-q (implies (p x) (q x)) :rule-classes :tau-system)

; is a legal tau rule.  But now imagine that p and p-implies-q are introduced
; inside an encapsulate constraining p.  Then if the encapsulation fails to
; export the fact that p is Boolean, the second pass will fail because
; p-implies-q is not a tau rule.  The ``syntactic'' check that it is a legal
; rule, made in the first pass, is actually not quite enough to ensure
; legality.  We cause a hard error in the second pass when this occurs.  This
; is not unprecedented; see the hard error caused by
; add-type-prescription-rule.  But there is a similar but more common and
; insidious problem arising from regeneration.  Forget about encapsulation;
; let p, q, and p-implies-q just be top-level events.  But imagine we're
; regenerating the tau database under an ens in which the Boolean nature of p
; is disabled.  Then p-implies-q is no longer a legal :tau-system rule even
; though it was legal when checked.  Had p-implies-q just been a :rewrite rule,
; say, and swept into the tau database by auto mode, it would make sense to
; quietly ignore this situation (and not add a tau rule).  But if p-implies-q
; is an explicit :tau-system rule it seems glib to ignore it in the
; reconstruction of the database but harsh to cause a hard error because of
; the disabled status of a :type-prescription rule.  So instead, we collect a
; list of all the explicit :tau-system rules excluded by the user's chosen ens
; and report it at the end of the regeneration process.  We call these ``lost
; tau rules.''

; On Tau Recognizers -- Part 2

; Recall that a tau is a set of tau recognizers representing their conjunction
; and denotes a monadic Boolean function.  We describe how we represent tau
; below.  But a basic idea is that we'll group all the positive recognizer
; symbols into one list representing their conjunction and all the (positive
; versions of the) negative ones in another list representing their
; disjunction.  Thus, we really only represent positive tau recognizers and use
; the sign convention (or the location of the recognizer in some data
; structure) to negate them.

; To make such lists of function symbols easier to search for a given symbol
; we order them and assign each monadic Boolean function symbol a unique
; natural number called its tau index.  The index of each such function will be
; stored on its property list under the property tau-pair, in a pair containing
; the index and function symbol.  Thus, one might find under 'symbolp 'tau-pair
; the pair (7 . SYMBOLP), or whatever the index for symbolp is.

; Note: When constants in this code refer to the indices of specific functions,
; we have a check in check-built-in-constants that insures that the index is
; still correct, since they may shift as Boolean functions are added.

; As noted, we use the notation sign/r to denote a signed tau recognizer, where
; sign = T means the recognizer is positive and sign = NIL means it is
; negative.  Often in our code r is actually a tau-pair.  That is, we might
; write sign/r in a comment but in the code r is (7 . SYMBOLP).  If the
; associated sign were NIL, this would denote (lambda (x) (not (symbolp x))).

; This raises the question of how we represent the unnamed tau recognizers as
; ACL2 objects?  We certainly do not want to represent the function (lambda (x)
; (equal x 'abc)) as the list object '(lambda (x) (equal x 'abc))!  We need a
; succinct and cheap representation for ``equalities with constants'' and
; ``arithmetic inequalities with rationals'' that correspond to the role played
; by tau pairs for those recognizers with symbolic names like SYMBOLP.

; In general our code uses two variables, e.g., sign and r, in tandem to
; represent a signed recognizer sign/r.  We only represent positive
; recognizers, r, and use the sign part of the sign/r notation to handle the
; negatives.

; The equality tau recognizers, (lambda (x) (equal x '<evg>)), are represented
; by a singleton list containing the <evg>, i.e., (<evg>).  This is cheap
; because it is just the cdr of the (QUOTE <evg>) inside the equality term.  It
; is convenient because to apply a named tau recognizer to an evg (to see
; whether it is true or false) we apply the named function to a singleton list
; containing the evg in question, so this notation facilitates that application
; without consing.  We can tell whether an r in the sign/r notation is a
; tau-pair (representing a named recognizer) or a singleton <evg> (representing
; an equality with that <evg>) by testing (cdr r).  If (cdr r) is non-nil, it
; is the function symbol naming the recognizer, otherwise r is a singleton evg.

; The arithmetic inequality tau recognizers, (lambda (x) (< x 'k)) and (lambda
; (x) (< 'k x)), are represented by (k . :lessp-x-k) and (k . :lessp-k-x)
; respectively.  Note that this might look like a tau pair but :lessp-x-k and
; :lessp-k-x are keywords and hence not function symbols.  Note also that
; putting the keyword in the cdr of the cons rather than in the car was a
; deliberate decision, even though it is sort of backward if the keyword is
; thought of the ``function symbol'' and the k is a ``parameter.''  By putting
; the keyword in the cdr we can tell what sort of recognizer r represents by
; using eq tests on the cdr only.

; Thus, the following test can determine what kind of tau recognizer r
; represents.  (Technically, the terms shown in the comments below are
; the BODIES of the (lambda (x) ...) expression r represents.)

; (cond ((eq (cdr r) nil)
;        (let ((evg (car r)))
;          ...                  ; r represents (EQUAL x 'evg), furthermore r
;                               ; is a singleton list containing evg suitable
;                               ; for using ev-fncall-w to apply some monadic
;                               ; function.
;          ))
;       ((eq (cdr r) :lessp-x-k)
;        (let ((k (car r)))
;          ...                  ; r represents (< x 'k), where k is a RATIONALP.
;          ))
;       ((eq (cdr r) :lessp-k-x)
;        (let ((k (car r)))
;          ...                  ; r represents (< 'k x), where k is a RATIONALP.
;          ))
;       (t (let ((p (cdr r))
;                (i (car r)))
;            ...                ; r represents (p x), furthermore, i is the
;                               ; tau index of monadic function symbol p.
;            )))

; Note that tests in CCL show that is sped up (by perhaps 10%) by binding the
; variable symbol discriminator to (cdr r) and using discriminator everywhere
; (cdr r) appears above.

; On Tau Intervals and < versus <=

; The tau data structure is defined below.  But it contains another data
; structure called a tau-interval, which represents a function that bounds its
; argument to an interval between two rationals.  Its argument need not be
; a rational, indeed, its argument need not even be an acl2-numberp.
; For example, every non-numeric ACL2 object x satisfies (-2 < x < 2)!

(defrec tau-interval (domain (lo-rel . lo) . (hi-rel . hi)) t)

; where

; * domain is INTEGERP, RATIONALP, ACL2-NUMBERP, or NIL and indicates the
;   domain of the interval.  That is, it is either the integer line, the
;   rational line, the acl2-numberp line, or the entire ACL2 universe ``line''.
;   (The ACL2 universe ``line'' is not quite a line: the acl2-numbers are laid
;   out linearly as one would expect, and all the non-acl2-numbers are in an
;   equivalence class with 0.)  If the domain is INTEGERP, we impose additional
;   invariants on the other components as described below.

; * lo-rel and hi-rel are T or NIL and indicate whether the corresponding
;   relation is < or <= (T is strict; nil is weak inequality); if the domain
;   is INTEGERP, we always use weak inequalities; and

; * lo and hi are either NIL or rationals and represent the lower and upper
;   bounds, with NIL being the corresponding infinity.  If the domain is INTEGERP,
;   we squeeze the bounds to be integers.  Thus, while it is technically
;   possible to create a tau-interval with
;   (make tau-interval
;         :domain 'INTEGERP
;         :lo 1/2
;         :lo-rel t
;         :hi-rel t
;         :hi 5/2)
;   we prefer to round the bounds up and down (respectively) and weaken the
;   relations, converting 1/2 < x < 5/2 to 1 <= x <= 2.  This adjustment
;   is done with the function squeeze-k.

;   Technically there is no reason to exclude the bounds from being
;   complex-rationals.  <= is a non-strict total order on acl2-numberp.  For
;   example, it is a theorem that if (<= #c(1 2) x) and (<= x #c(1 2)) then x =
;   #c(1 2).  So we could allow the bounds to be complex-rationals and continue
;   more or less as we do here.  However, (a) it gets a little more complicated
;   because in squeezing intervals around integers we'd have to take the
;   realpart of the bounds, e.g., to raise a strict lower bound on an integer
;   we'd use (+ (floor (REALPART lo) 1) 1) instead of (+ (floor lo 1) 1) if lo
;   can be complex, and (b) complex bounds probably never occur!  So the little
;   added complexity probably wouldn't buy us anything.

; Terminology: A ``bound'' is determined by a pair, namely a ``relation''
; (coded as a Boolean flag) and an ``extent'' (coded as either a NIL --
; representing an infinity -- or a rational).  Which infinity nil represents
; depends on whether we're talking about an upper or lower bound.

; We sometimes use the following notation:

;   (defun <? (rel x y)
;     (if (or (null x) (null y))
;        t
;         (if rel
;             (< x y)
;             (<= x y))))

; This function implements the notion of rel being a boolean encoding of strong or
; weak inequality and nil representing the ``appropriate'' infinity.  So for
; example, (<? t 5 7), (<? t nil -1000), (<? t 1000 nil).  When stating theorems
; in our specifications below we tend to use the <? function but to restrict one of
; x or y to being non-nil because our theorems are not meant to allow the user
; to compare infinities.

; We sometimes write (x <? y) meaning (<? rel x y) for some rel.  We sometimes
; even write (lo <? x <? hi) meaning (and (<? lo-rel lo x) (<? hi-rel x hi)).
; Note that this is an abuse of notation!  The two occurrences of the symbol
; ``<?'' denote different relations!

; We sometimes write (rel x y) to mean (<? rel x y).

; Thus, with appropriate interpretation of the flags and infinities, a
; tau-interval denotes the function:

; (lambda (x) (and (,domain x) (,lo-rel ',lo x) (,hi-rel x ',hi)).

; Note that even though we only provide signed < as a tau recognizer, we allow
; either < or <= to be used in bounding an interval.  If we did not allow <= we
; could discard the lo-rel and hi-rel -- they would both always be < -- but
; we'd have to add two signs.  We think <= encourages more reliable thinking.
; The only reason we don't consider signed <= as a tau recognizer above is that
; <= is not a function symbol in ACL2, it is a macro that expands into negative
; <.

; Convention:  When using the (make tau-interval ...) idiom we tend to
; list the parameters in the order shown below:

; (make tau-interval :lo k :lo-rel t :hi-rel nil :hi d)

; because it is suggestive of k < ...  <= d.

; However, when we pass around bounds and relations as arguments, we tend to
; list the relation first (befitting its role of denoting a function symbol)
; and then the bound, thus writing (positive-lower-boundp rel k) rather than
; (positive-lower-boundp k rel).

; Note that the universal tau-interval (where all components are nil)

; (make tau-interval
;       :recog  nil  ; not known to be a number
;       :lo     nil  ; negative infinity
;       :lo-rel nil  ; <=
;       :hi-rel nil  ; <=
;       :hi     nil  ; positive infinity
;       )

; makes absolutely no restriction on the subject.  We use nil to represent this
; tau-interval (and the variants with strict relations) rather than create and
; subsequently test against (nil (nil . nil) . (nil . nil)).  However, we
; exploit the fact that (access tau-interval nil :hi-rel), for example,
; computes to nil.  (Tests show that it is faster to execute (access
; tau-interval x :hi-rel) than (if x (access tau-interval x :hi-rel) nil) even
; when x is nil.)

; If an interval's domain is the integers, we narrow the bounds to integers and
; weaken the relation.  For example, instead of creating

; (lambda (x) (and (integerp x) (< 1/2 x) (< x 5/2)))

; we use

; (lambda (x) (and (integerp x) (<= 1 x) (<= x 2)))

; Aside: This treatment of INTEGERP is an example of a much more general idea
; we're not prepared to implement.  Suppose DIV4P recognizes integers divisible
; by 4.  Then if DIV4P is in the pos-pairs of a tau with interval 1 <= ... <=
; 30, we could shrink the interval to 4 <= ... <= 28.

; To do this we'd need, for selected recognizers, a pair of ``generators:''

; - generate the least y such that y > x and (DIV4P y)
; - generate the greatest y such that y < x and (DIV4P y)

; The infrastructure to support this is tedious.  One would have to prove rules
; characterizing the correctness of such generators and then use such rules to
; build a data structure that would be used when new pos-pairs are added or
; when bounds are changed.  Perhaps somebody would like a project?  End of Aside.

; We use tau-intervals to say everything they can.  This is a strange remark that
; bears explanation.  For example, a tau might say that its subject is a natural
; number (in addition to having many other properties).  Should the interval in that
; tau redundantly be the tau-interval equivalent to NATP,

; (lambda (x) (and (integerp x) (<= 0 x)))

; or should we just store NIL as the tau-interval for this tau on the grounds
; that the NATP property is stored elsewhere?  In short, should the
; tau-interval in a tau be allowed to be redundant?  Our answer is yes: we use
; tau-intervals to say everything they can.  The idea is the linear arithmetic
; facts about the subject will be found in the tau-interval -- even if they are
; pretty unrestrictive like INTEGERP or RATIONALP without any bounds.  We will
; arrange to adjust the tau-interval (shrinking it) whenever we learn anything
; that allows that.

; Perhaps the strangest implication of this decision is that a tau-interval can
; say that its subject is equal to a particular rational constant, by weakly
; bounding the subject above and below by that rational constant.  In the case
; that the constant is 0, one must add that the subject is rationalp.  This all
; follows from a theorem shown among the ``helpful reminders about ACL2
; arithmetic'' below.

; A further implication is that if we are using a tau to represent a
; conjunctive rule and we wish to represent the conjunct (equal e 5) we will
; get the same thing as the tau for (and (equal e 5) (<= 5 e) (<= e 5)).

; Finally, some intervals are contradictory and are never built; we try to
; signal contradiction instead of creating empty intervals like:

; (lambda (x) (and (rationalp x) (< 10 x) (< x 5))).

; However, in the event that we need a canonical empty interval, here is the
; one we use.

(defconst *tau-empty-interval*
  (make tau-interval
        :domain nil
        :lo-rel t
        :lo 0
        :hi-rel t
        :hi 0))

; Because we do not guarantee always to construct the canonical empty interval,
; we test for it with this more general function.  This function recognizes
; *tau-empty-interval* and also has the property that if int is an interval
; that passes this test, then no x is in it.

(defun tau-empty-intervalp (int)
  (and int
       (access tau-interval int :lo)
       (access tau-interval int :hi)
       (if (or (access tau-interval int :lo-rel)
               (access tau-interval int :hi-rel))
           (<= (access tau-interval int :hi)

; On the Tau Data Structure

; So finally, the tau data structure itself:

(defrec tau
  ((pos-evg . neg-evgs) interval . (pos-pairs . neg-pairs))
  t)

; where the shape of each component is as follows:

; pos-evg:   nil or a singleton list containing an evg
; neg-evgs:  list of singleton lists of evgs, duplicate-free, suitably ordered
; interval:  nil or a tau-interval
; pos-pairs: list of tau-pairs, duplicate-free, ordered descending
; neg-pairs: list of tau-pairs, duplicate-free ordered descending

; Note: The ordering on neg-evgs is ascending ``almost'' lexorder, except that
; NIL is the smallest element.  The ordering on the pairs is descending by tau
; index of the pairs.  There is no reason for the opposite orders except for
; the pre-existence of certain sort functions.  There are additional
; restrictions on these fields so that a tau is kept in a normal form.  See
; below.

; Note: It might be wise to add another slot to tau: :neg-nil.  This would be
; equivalent to having (nil) in :neg-evgs except we'd never delete it as
; subsumed and we wouldn't have to search or eval for it to test whether a tau
; is non-nil.  But unless the tau system is too slow, we won't add this
; optimization.

; Note: For the full hons regression suite (3,117 certified books as of Feb,
; 2013) the longest :neg-evgs seen was 254, the longest :pos-pairs was 30, and
; the longest :neg-pairs was 181.

; Roughly speaking, the fields of a tau contribute conjunctions to its overall
; meaning, which we state below in terms of some object e to which it is applied:

; pos-evg:   e is equal to the given evg [if pos-evg is not nil]
; neg-evgs:  e is equal to none of the listed evgs
; pos-pairs: e satisfies all of the function symbols (actually, tau pairs) listed
; neg-pairs: e satisfies none of the function symbols (actually, tau pairs) listed
; interval:  e falls in the given interval

; Some redundancy is allowed between the interval and the rest of a tau, but
; nowhere else.  For example both the pos-pairs and the interval may say that e
; is an INTEGERP.  The motto on the interval is that everything that can be
; said with the interval is said.  The motto on the rest of tau is that the
; only redundancy is in the interval.  See On the Additional Restrictions on
; Tau Fields.

; Here, for example, is a tau constructed during the computation of

; (tau-term '(if (integerp x)
;                (if (equal x '2)
;                    'hello
;                    (if (equal x '3)
;                        'hello
;                        x))  ; <--- the tau below is the tau of x here
;                'bye)
;          nil nil nil (ens state)(w state))

; in a Version_4.3 boot-strap world.  The tau for the indicated x, constructed
; by repeated tau-assumes and extracted from the resulting alist at the
; location marked above, is:

; ((NIL                                 ; pos-evg
;   .
;   ((2) (3)))                          ; neg-evgs
;  (INTEGERP (NIL) NIL)                 ; interval
;  .
;  (((18 . O-FINP)                      ; pos-pairs
;    (9 . EQLABLEP)

;    (4 . INTEGERP)
;    (0 . ACL2-NUMBERP))

; If you (decode-tau * 'x) you get the body of the lambda expression it represents, which is

;       (NOT (READ-FILE-LISTP1 X))
;       (NOT (WRITABLE-FILE-LISTP1 X))
;       (NOT (BAD-ATOM X))))

; Of course, this will change if additional recognizers or new relations
; between existing recognizers are added to the boot-strap.  But it illustrates
; the structure of an actual tau.

; That is, if we say x has that tau, then we know x is an INTEGERP other than 2
; and 3, and ``everything'' that implies about other tau recognizers.

; Note that the meaning of a tau is the CONJUNCTION of its elements.  We
; sometimes write M[tau] to mean the meaning of tau.

; Note: This interpretation of sets of recognizers is exactly the OPPOSITE of
; type-set!  For example, if we say x has type-set {p q} we mean x either
; satisfies p or satisfies q.  But if that same set is interpreted as a tau, we
; are saying that x satisfies both p and q.  Of course, some tau are
; inconsistent which is why we place additional restrictions (see below) on
; tau.

; We sometimes informally exhibit a tau as a set in notation like this:

; {/=2, /=3, integerp, rationalp, ..., -characterp, ...}

; or obvious variants like

; {nil/2, nil/3, t/integerp, t/rationalp, ..., nil/characterp, ...}.

; and if the interval is interesting we may include elements like 0<= or <=45.

; On the Built-in Tau and the Abuse of Tau Representation

; Below is a well-formed but empty tau.  It says we don't know anything about
; the term to which it is associated.

; Abuse of Tau Representation: Nil is synonymous with *tau-empty* as a

; result as applying them to *tau-empty*.  We actually do this in one place: In
; ok-to-fire-signature-rulep we are supposed to pass in a list of recognizer
; sets in 1:1 correspondence with the formals of a function.  Sometimes we pass
; in nil instead, knowing that every ``element'' of nil is nil and that those
; nils will be treated like *tau-empty*.

; On the Additional Restrictions on Tau Fields

; We enforce restrictions on the tau fields to minimize redundancy and shorten
; the lists involved.  The motto here is ``The only redundancy in a tau is in
; the interval.''

; Restriction 0: No tau should be ``obviously contradictory''.

;  Restriction 0.1:  The intersection of pos-pairs and neg-pairs is empty.

;  Restriction 0.2: When pos-evg is non-nil, no pos-pair evaluates to false on
;  that evg and no neg-pair evaluates to true on it.

; Restriction 1: If pos-evg is non-nil, neg-evgs must be nil.

; Restriction 2: If pos-evg is non-nil, pos-pairs (and neg-pairs) should be as
; short as possible, i.e., not contain recognizers that evaluate to true (false)
; on that evg.  That means when pos-evg is non-nil the only elements in
; pos-pairs and neg-pairs are recognizers that cannot be evaluated.

; Restriction 3: Neg-evgs is duplicate-free and ordered ascending by ``almost''
; lexorder (NIL is the smallest item in our ordering).  Pos-pairs and neg-pairs
; are duplicate-free and ordered by their indices.

; Restriction 4: Neg-evgs should be as short as possible given pos-pairs,
; neg-pairs, and the interval.  It is illegal to have an evg in :neg-evgs such
; that some p in :pos-pairs evaluates to false on evg or some p in :neg-pairs
; evaluates to true on evg or is outside the given interval.  For example, if
; :pos-pairs includes NATP, it is illegal to include (the singleton list
; containing) LOAD in :neg-evgs.  That inequality is implied by :pos-evgs.

; Restriction 5: The interval of a tau has as its domain one of INTEGERP,
; RATIONALP, ACL2-NUMBERP, or NIL; if INTEGERP both relations are nil (<=) and
; both extents are integers (or nil).  Otherwise, extents are rational (or
; nil).  When a tau is an equality with a rational constant, the accompanying
; interval is the singleton interval containing that constant.  Intervals are
; never empty.

; It is sometimes convenient to think in terms of the set comprehending the
; meaning of a tau.  S[tau] = {x | (M[tau] x)}.  Thus, S[{NATP}] = the set of
; all naturals.  If tau has :neg-evgs '((-23)(-24)), :pos-pairs '((1
; . integerp)) and :neg-pairs '((0 . NATP)), then S[tau] is the set of all
; non-natural integers other than -23 and -24.

; A tau is ``obviously contradictory'' if (a) there is a non-nil
; intersection between the pos-pairs and neg-pairs, or if (b) pos-evg is a
; singleton evg and either (b1) the recognizer of some pos-pair evaluates to nil
; on that evg, or (b2) the recognizer of some neg-pair evaluates to t on that
; evg.  If tau is obviously contradictory it is clear that M[tau] is nil.
; However, the converse is not necessarily true.  For example, one might define
; two tau recognizers:

; (defun IS-NATP (x) (NATP x))
; (defun IS-NOT-NATP (x) (not (NATP x)))

; and then the meaning of the recognizer set containing both in pos-pairs is nil
; but the tau is not obviously contradictory.  More complicated examples can be
; constructed involving the evgs and the pairs.  Pragmatically, the user should
; not define predicates as the negations of other predicates nor should
; equality-with-constants be ``hidden'' as predicates.  But we do not enforce
; this and draw no logical conclusions from the fact that a tau is NOT
; obviously contradictory.

; We often return the keyword :contradiction instead of a tau when we have
; detected that tau is obviously contradictory.  That is, if a variable in our
; code is said to be a tau it may be an instance of the tau record class above
; or it may be the symbol :contradiction.  Generally speaking we try to avoid
; even constructing obviously contradictory recognizer sets.

; In order to highlight when :contradiction is being used as a tau, we define
; the following constant.  However, our code assumes the value of this constant
; is a symbol (e.g., we use EQ to test against it).  It is sometimes convenient
; to think of *tau-contradiction* as a recognizer set that contains every
; tau recognizer in both its positive and negative fields.  That's a little
; misleading because the representation of tau do not allow more than one
; :pos-evg, but if it did (e.g., if we had :pos-evgs instead of :pos-evg), the
; canonical *tau-contradiction* contains all the evgs in :pos-evgs and in
; :neg-evgs and has all the recognizers in :pos-pairs and in :neg-pairs.

          :interval *tau-empty-interval*))

; The above tau is contradictory on its face: it specifies an empty interval,
; so if (h x) has this tau as its pos-implicants, for example, then (h a)
; implies 0 < a < 0.  A way to create an h with this property is shown in the
; example (sent by Grant Passmore) in add-tau-simple-rule below.

; Note on contradictionp versus :contradiction versus the *contradictory-tau*:
; When a tau is being returned we signal contradictions by using the bogus
; ``tau'' *tau-contradiction*; we could have chosen to return
; *contradictory-tau* instead but that would then require testing for EQUAL
; rather than EQ and we test for *tau-contradiction* quite a lot especially in
; tau-term and tau-assume, which are used a lot during proofs involving big
; terms.  So we wanted to make testing fast.  When we're trafficking in other
; objects, e.g., the property list world, we signal contradictions with the
; familiar (mv contradictionp ...) convention because the contradiction
; detected may be deeply buried in the world.  We do not ever put
; *tau-contradiction* into objects containing tau data structures.  However,
; when we are trafficking in the property list world (meaning we might have
; updated various parts of the tau database, including the pos- or
; neg-implicants of a symbol) we might store the contradictory tau,
; *contradictory-tau*, in the database, as happens when we build the
; pos-implicants, for example, of a predicate that is identically nil.  (See
; the example in add-tau-simple-rule.)

; It would clearly be better to have a single way to denote a contradictory
; tau, e.g., to allow the symbol :contradiction to be treated like a tau but
; tested with eq.  But that would require testing for that symbol in the tau
; accessors which would slow us down.

; We will be more precise about the database later, but Simple rules are used
; to populate the database, storing all the implications of a given
; recognizers truth or falsity.  These implications are just tau representing
; the set of all truths that follow.  For example, under NATP we will store the
; tau of all known recognizers implied by t/NATP, as well as all known
; recognizers implied by nil/NATP.  The database is used to collect known
; truths about a term, by unioning together the sets implied by everything we
; know about the term and then augmenting that set with Conjunctive rules that
; may tell us other things given the particular combination of things we know.

; Conjunctive rules are formulas that tell us that certain combinations of
; recognizers imply other recognizers.  For example, if a Conjunctive rule says
; that p and q imply r, and we have deduced a tau that contains p and contains
; q, then we add r to tau.  This is called ``completing'' the tau.  It happens
; that Conjunctive rules are represented as sets of recognizers, so we use the
; same tau datastructure to represent them but we do not interpret them with M.
; The rule (p & q) --> r is represented by the set C = {-p -q -r}.  To use C as
; a conjunctive rule we ask whether some tau, just derived, contains all but
; one of the elements of C and if so we can add the negation of the omitted
; element of C.

; This brings us to Signature rules of both forms.  Signature rules tells us
; facts about the value of a function given facts about its inputs.  Signature
; rules play the primary role in determining the tau of a term (or of its
; MV-NTH components) given tau assumptions about subterms.

(defrec signature-rule (input-tau-list
                        (vars . dependent-hyps)
                        output-sign output-recog) t)

; Signature rules are hung on some n-ary function symbol.  The formula from
; which such a rule is derived is:

; (implies (and (tau_1 v1) ... (tau_n vn)
;               (dhyp_1 v1 ... vn) ... (dhyp_k v1 ... vn))
;          (tau (fn v1 ... vn)))

; modulo several obvious generalizations of the form and arbitrary ordering and
; mixing of the hypotheses.  The representation of such a formula as a
; signature-rule is:

; :inputs-tau-list  - (tau_1 ... tau_n) -- required tau of corresponding vars
; :vars             - (v1 ... vn) -- the vars used in the conclusion
; :dependent-hyps   - list of terms in vars ((dhyp_1 v1 ... vn) ...)
; :output-sign      - T (positive) or NIL (negative)
; :output-recog     - tau, i.e., tau-pair or singleton evg list

; Foreshadowing: We use this same record for both forms of signature rules.
; Under the SIGNATURE-RULES-FORM-1 property of a function symbol fn we will
; find a list of these records, interpreted in the obvious way about calls of
; fn: if the actuals satisfy their respective tau in :inputs-tau-lst and the
; :dependent-hyps are relieved, then the output of fn satisfies the output-sign
; and output-recog.  Under the SIGNATURE-RULES-FORM-2 property of a fn with
; output arity m we may find a list of length m, each element being a list of
; these same records.  The interpretation of the records in slot i is that the
; ith value returned by fn has the indicated tau.  We will allow both
; properties to exist for a function symbol.  That is, one might prove that (fn
; x y) is a true-list of length 3 and might also characterize the tau of
; (mv-nth '0 (fn x y)), (mv-nth '1 (fn x y)), and (mv-nth '2 (fn x y)).  When
; trying to determine the tau of an (mv-nth 'i (fn a b)) expression we use only
; the rules in the ith slot of the form 2 rules for f.  When trying to
; determine the tau of (fn a b) we use only the form 1 rules for fn.

; Finally, when we are processing terms, either to find their tau or to assume
; them true, we may do a small amount of rewriting.  In particular, we expand
; so-called big switch function calls.  Roughly speaking, a ``big switch''
; function is a nonrec function that is initially controlled entirely by the
; tau of a single formal variable.  For example, (little-switch key x) defined
; to be (symbolp x) if key is 'SYMBOLP, (natp x) if key is 'NATP, and (consp x)
; otherwise, is a big switch function with the variable key as its ``switch
; variable.''

; If fn is a big switch function, then we can partially evaluate a call of that
; function efficiently under some tau assumptions.  In particular, we do not
; need to instantiate the entire body of the definition.  If we know enough
; about the switch actual to navigate past all those tau tests on the switch
; formal, we can reach a ``leaf'' and instantiate just it.  If we cannot
; navigate to a leaf, we do not expand the big switch function at all.

; If a theorem, (EQUAL (fn . formals) body), defines a big switch function we
; make a big switch rule of the form:

(defrec big-switch-rule (formals switch-var switch-var-pos body) nil)

; where switch-var is the switch var and switch-var-pos is its position in
; formals.  That rule will be stored under fn on the property 'big-switch.

; Obviously Contradictory Recognizer Sets

; We define make-tau which takes the four components of a tau and returns the
; corresponding instance of tau, unless that tau is obviously contradictory, in
; which case we return *tau-contradiction*.  The four arguments are assumed
; individually to be well-formed, e.g., duplicate-free and ordered
; appropriately.

        (t nil)))

(defun tau-pair-member (pair pairs)

; This function determines whether (car pair) is a member of (strip-cars
; pairs), but assumes that pairs is ordered descending on the cars, as enforced
; by merge-sort-car->.  Note that it is tempting to think this function
; determines whether pair is a member of pairs, but in fact the cdrs of the
; pairs are totally ignored.  Thus, (tau-pair-member '(1 . A) '((1 . B))) is
; true!

  (tau-pair-member1 (car pair) pairs))

; On the Use of ENS by Function Evaluation in the Tau System

; The following function is used throughout the tau system to determine whether
; a recognizer will accept (recognize) a given constant or not.  In an earlier
; incarnation of the function, it was not sensitive to the enabled status of the
; executable-counterpart of the tau recognizer fn.

; One argument for making the tau system respect the current enabled structure
; is that some authors disable :executable-counterparts in their proofs and if
; tau does not respect the disabling, it is behaving contrary to the author's
; wishes.  This happens in the file Proof-Of-Equiv-From-M-Corr.lisp of
; community book books/workshops/1999/embedded/Proof-Of-Contribution/ by
; P.G. Bertoli and P. Traverso (which is a chapter in the ACL2 Case Studies
; book), where the authors execute (in-theory (current-theory 'ground-zero))
; near the top of the book, thus disabling almost everything.  The hypothesis
; (rel-prime-moduli '(11 13 15 17 19)) is used frequently and proofs break if
; it is evaluated.  This particular book is not a very good argument for
; respecting ens, since the script could probably have been developed without
; this Draconian disabling.  A better reason to make tau respect ens is that
; some executable-counterparts could be so inefficient to compute that the user
; would prefer that they never be run.  But tau would run them and lose.  In
; fact, in that earlier incarnation just mentioned, tau did run them and did
; lose.  See the example below.

; On the other side, however, is the tau system convention that if a recognizer
; in the pos-pairs of a tau accepts a given evg, then that evg is not included
; in the neg-evgs.  For example, suppose we want to construct the tau that
; denotes (lambda (v) (and (not (equal v 23)) (foop v))).  But suppose that
; (foop 23) is false.  Then there is no point in including the ``(not (equal v
; 23))'' since is implied by the (foop v).  Indeed, we'd represent this tau as
; the set {foop}.  Suppose that tau were stored as the positive implicants of
; some recognizer in the database.  Now imagine the user disables the
; executable-counterpart of foop.  Are we to recompute the normal form of all
; the stored taus?  We just can't bear the thought!

; So we have adopted a slightly inelegant approach: Tau is sensitive to the
; enabled status of the executable-counterparts of the tau recognizers it needs
; to evaluate but suffers unnecessary incompleteness as a result.  For example,
; one might build a tau in the database that contains foop and that (at the
; time it was built) also records that 23 is not in the tau.  But then one
; disables foop and thereafter it is unknown whether 23 is in the tau or not.

; The second occurrence of a local LEMMA4 in the community book
; unicode/utf8-decode.lisp provides an interesting test of the available
; strategies for dealing with expensive calls of ev-fncall-w-tau-recog.

; If the tau-system is disabled, that LEMMA4 takes only about 0.06 seconds to
; prove (on a 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 with 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 Macbook Pro).  But
; if tau-system is enabled and no special steps are taken, it takes 5.91
; seconds.  The problem is that the tau recognizer TEST-UTF8-COMBINE4 is
; evaluated several times by the tau system as it computes the tau for various
; terms, and TEST-UTF8-COMBINE4 is very expensive to compute.  Tau evaluates
; this user-defined predicate a total of 11 times in all, on 0, NIL, and T.

; This raises two problems: how do you discover the source of this slowdown,
; and what do you do about it after discovering it?  It was discovered by
; noticing the time difference for the utf8-decode book in two successive
; regressions and then using the Allegro profiler to identify the *1* function
; for TEST-UTF8-COMBINE4 as the culprit.  Once that was confirmed, experiments
; were done to determine all the calls of ev-fncall-w-tau-recognizer in the
; entire book (just to see if it got excessive).  It turns out it is called a
; total of 102,004 times to evaluate 96 different tau recognizers on these
; constants: (-1 244 240 237 224 1 4 3 2 0 T NIL).  A total of 480 distinct (fn
; 'evg) are involved and about 5.8 seconds is consumed in these.

; But by far the most expensive calls are the 11 calls of TEST-UTF8-COMBINE4:

; (evg val n secs)

; (0   T   7 0.180351)
; (T   T   2 1.152991)
; (NIL T   2 1.163224)

; E.g., TEST-UTF8-COMBINE4 is called 7 times on 0 and the first call took
; 0.180351 seconds.  Note how expensive T and NIL are.

; After the defun of ev-fncall-w-tau-recog, below, we include a comment that
; shows the raw Lisp code used to accumulate such information.  This is
; preserved here for future reference and may be advertised to some users
; suffering slowdowns.  NOTE: After these notes were written, we implemented
; the time-tracker mechanism as a way of diagnosing such slowdowns.

; There are four mechanisms in tau for dealing with this.  Mechanism A is to do
; nothing and suffer the slowdown.  Mechanism B is to disable the tau-system!
; Mechanism C is to prove the ``mechanism-c-lemma,'' characterizing the value
; of the expensive recognizer on the constants in question, provided one can
; determine what those constants are.  Mechanism D is to disable the expensive
; recognizer and perhaps lose some completeness.

; Mechanism             LEMMA4 Proof Time Reported in Summary
; A [do nothing]                 5.91 seconds
; B [disable tau]                0.07 seconds
; C [build in expensive calls]   0.07 seconds
; D [disable expensive calls]    0.07 seconds

; Here is the lemma used in Mechanism C:
; (local (defthm mechanism-c-lemma
;          (and (test-utf8-combine4 0)
;               (test-utf8-combine4 nil)

;          :rule-classes :tau-system))
; Time:  2.50 seconds (prove: 2.50, print: 0.00, other: 0.00)

; This lemma stores the value of the recognizer on its property list and it is
; looked up instead of computed.

; Note that while the lemma allows the fast proof of LEMMA4, the lemma itself
; takes 2.5 seconds to prove.

;   ; Ev-fncall-w-tau-recog, above, is used to evaluate tau predicates on

; On the Most Basic Implications of Being in an Interval

; Suppose x is in an interval (lo <? x <? hi).  Suppose k is some rational.  What
; does the interval tell us about (x <? k)?

; Below are four theorems, labeled A, B, C, and D.  A tells us that (< x k) is
; true and B tells us that it is false.  C tells us that (<= x k) is true, and
; D tells us that it is false.  Of course, the tests comparing x to the
; endpoints of its interval are really just tests on the strengths of the
; applicable relations:

; test in       test in
; theorem       code

; (< x hi)      hi-rel = t
; (<= x hi)     hi-rel = nil
; (< lo x)      lo-rel = t
; (<= lo x)     lo-rel = nil

; Furthermore, the first conjuncts in the hypotheses for B and C

; test in theorem                          test ``in'' code

; (or (< lo x) (<= lo x))                  (or lo-rel (not lo-rel)) = t
; (or (< x hi) (<= x hi))                  (or hi-rel (not hi-rel)) = t

; are propositionally and so may be ignored.

; (thm (and
;       (implies (or (and (<  x hi) (<= hi k))   ; A
;                    (and (<= x hi) (<  hi k)))
;                (< x k))
;
;      (implies (and (or (< lo x) (<= lo x))     ; B

;                    (<= hi k))
;               (<= x k))
;
;      (implies (or (and (< lo x) (<= k lo))     ; D
;                   (and (<= lo x) (< k lo)))
;               (not (<= x k)))))

; These four theorems could be coded this way to determine that (<? rel x k) is
; known true, known false, or unknown given the interval:

; (if rel
;     (cond ((if hi-rel (<= hi k) (< hi k)) t)   ; A

;           ((if lo-rel (<= k lo) (< k lo)) nil) ; D
;           (t '?)))

; However, this analysis ignores the infinities.  If x has no upper bound
; (hi=nil), it will be impossible to show that k is an upper bound, i.e., that
; either (< x k) or (<= x k) is true.  Similarly, if x has no lower bound
; (lo=nil), it will be impossible to show that k is a lower bound, i.e., that
; (<= k x) or (< k x) is true, i.e., that (< x k) or (<= x k) is false.  Thus,
; we must return ?  on any branch that involves testing an infinity.

(defun interval-decider (lo-rel lo hi-rel hi rel k)

; Lo-rel, lo, hi-rel and hi are the bounds on an interval containing some
; unknown x.  Either or both of lo and hi may be nil denoting their respective

; i.e., (< x k) or (<= x k), depending on rel.  The question is: if we know

; On Firing Signature Rules

; Consider a term like (fn a).  Suppose tau1 is the tau for a.  Suppose the
; signature for fn is fn: tau2 --> tau3.  To fire this rule we will need to
; determine whether S[tau1] \subset S[tau2].

; To think about this, ignore the concrete structure of a tau, including the
; signs of things; think a tau as a set of recognizers (!).  The meaning of a
; recognizer set is the conjunction of its elements -- so bigger sets of
; recognizers comprehend smaller sets of objects.  In particular, S[tau1]
; \subset S[tau2] if tau2 \subset tau1.  (Of course, it is possible for S[tau1]
; to be a subset of S[tau2] under other conditions, but this one is
; sufficient.)

; Let tau1 = {p1 ... pn} and tau2 = {q1 ... qk}.  We want to know whether
; S[tau1] \subset S[tau2], which is equivalent to M[tau1] --> M[tau2], which is

; (implies (and (p1 x) ... (pn x)) (and (q1 x) ... (qk x))).

; Note that one way to prove this conjecture would be to show that each qi is
; some pj.

; Because of the concrete structure of tau we need only compare them
; component-wise.  For example, if q is among the :neg-pairs of one we need to
; search for it only among the :neg-pairs of the other.  This holds for the
; four components pos-evg, neg-evgs, pos-pairs, and neg-pairs.  We have to
; handle intervals specially.

(defun every-neg-evg-in-tau-p1
  (neg-evgs1 neg-evgs2 pos-pairs2 neg-pairs2 interval2 ens wrld)

; Neither neg-evgs1 nor neg-evgs2 contains (NIL).  This function is just an
; efficient way of checking that every element of neg-evgs1 is (a) in
; neg-evgs2, or (b) subsumed by the tau-interval interval2, (c) subsumed by an
; element of pos-pairs2, or (d) subsumed by an element of neg-pairs2.  For
; example, if an element of neg-evgs1 is /=7 then it might be subsumed in
; another tau by with an explicit /=7 in it, or by an interval not including 7,
; or by some sign/recognizer in the other tau being false on it.  We could do
; this by mapping over neg-evgs1 and just check member-neg-evgs and the other
; checks each element.  But that method is quadratic in the lengths of the two
; neg-evgs, since member-neg-evgs would repeatedly search neg-evgs2.  Instead,
; we exploit the fact that both neg-evgs are ``almost'' lexordered ascending.

; We will return to the issue of firing signature rules after we've dealt with
; intervals.

; On Comparing Bounds

; We now define four functions for comparing bounds:
; lower-bound-<=
; lower-bound->
; upper-bound->=
; upper-bound-<

; All four take the specification of two bounds, a-rel a and b-rel b, which are
; each upper or lower bounds of two intervals over the same domain and decide
; whether the first bound is in the given relation to the second one.  For
; example, (upper-bound-< a-rel a b-rel b) decides whether the upper bound
; a-rel a is strictly below the upper bound b-rel b.

; These functions are complicated by the fact that they compare bounds not
; merely numbers (we must take into account the strengths of the
; inequalities), that the domains are the same, that for INTEGERP domain the
; bounds are in our normal form (rel = nil and extent is an integer or NIL), and
; that a and/or b may be NIL, indicating the appropriate infinity.
; Nevertheless, the functions are very simple.  We first define all four and
; then we exhibit a big comment specifying one of them and proving it correct.

; The two lower-bound functions are actually the negations of each other, as
; are the two upper-bound functions.

; (lower-bound-<= a-rel a b-rel b) <--> (not (lower-bound-> a-rel a b-rel b))

; (upper-bound->= a-rel a b-rel b) <--> (not (upper-bound-< a-rel a b-rel b))

; a is NIL or a rational and b is NIL or a rational.

; Why define all four if two of them are the negations of the other two?  The
; answer is the same as to the question, ``why define ``>='' if it is just the
; negation of ``<''?  Answer: it clarifies thinking if one doesn't introduce
; negations.  We sometimes need ``>='' and sometimes need ``<''.

; Specification of Bound Comparisons

; We specify all four in terms of (implicit) intervals A and B because all
; our applications involve intervals and we find it clearer to think about
; relations on intervals than on bounds.  The (upper or lower, as appropriate)
; bounds on A are given by a-rel and a, and those on B are b-rel and b.  For
; brevity in our comments, we use LA(x) to mean that x satisfies the lower
; bound on A.  For example, if A's lower bound is given by arel=t and a = 5,
; then LA(x) means (< 5 x).  Similar conventions are made for LB(x), UA(x), and
; UB(x).

; We assume that the domains of both A and B are the same.  We furthermore
; assume that if the domain is INTEGERP, then a-rel and b-rel are both nil (<=)
; and that a and b are integers if they are non-nil.

; We describe the meaning of each of our four functions in three ways: an
; informal English sentence, a formula, and a picture.  In the pictures we use
; parentheses to mark the bounds of each interval.  But we do not mean to
; suggest that the intervals are open at that end.

; LOWER-BOUND-<=

;  Informally: lower bound of A is weakly below the lower bound of B, by which
;  we mean that anything satisfying the lower bound of B will also satisfy that
;  for A

;  Formally:   [all x : LB(x) ---> LA(x)]

;  Picture:    A   B
;              (---(---...

;  Informally: upper bound of A is weakly above the upper bound of B by which
;  we mean that anything satisfying the upper bound of B will also satisfy the

;  Picture:         B   A
;             ...---)---)

; LOWER-BOUND->

;  Informally: lower bound of A is strictly above the lower bound of B, by
;  which we mean not only that anything satisfying the lower bound of A
;  satisfies the lower bound of B but also that there is an element of the
;  domain which satisfies the lower bound of B but not that of A

;  Formally:  [all x : LA(x) ---> LB(x)] & [exists z : dom(z) & LB(z) & -LA(z)]

; We will prove that upper-bound-< is correct wrt our specification.

; Theorem:  Correctness of upper-bound-<.

; Suppose you have two intervals, A and B, over the same domain and suppose
; that a-rel a and b-rel b specify the bounds, respectively. Either or both of
; a and b may be NIL, denoting positive infinities.  If either is non-NIL, it
; is a rational.  Furthermore, if the domain in question is INTEGERP, both
; a-rel and b-rel are nil (<=) and a and b are integers unless they are NIL
; (infinity).

; We are to return T iff

; The picture:
;  Picture:         A   B
;             ...---)-z-)

; [i]                        & [ii]
; [all x : UA(x) ---> UB(x)] & [exists z : dom(z) & UB(z) & -UA(z)]

; Proof Sketch: Step 1.  We first deal with the two infinities.  Step 2.  Then
; we show, for rational a and b, that if we return T, conjuncts [i] and [ii]
; above both hold.  Step 3.  Then we show, for rational a and b, that if we
; return nil, at least one of the conjuncts fails to hold.

; Step 1: Suppose a is positive infinity.  Then upper-bound-< returns nil.  To
; see that this is correct, case split on whether b is positive infinity.  Then
; there can be no z such that UB(z) but such that -UA(z), so [ii] fails.  If b
; is finite, then [i] fails: let x be b+1 and observe that UA(x) holds but
; UB(x) requires (<? b-rel (+ b 1) b) which is nil.

; If on the other hand, a is finite but b is infinite, upper-bound-< returns t.
; But observe that UB(x) holds for everything, so [i] is true.  And [ii] is
; shown true by letting z be a+1, something in the domain such that UB(z) holds
; but (<? a-rel (+ a 1) a) does not.

; So henceforth we may assume both a and b are finite rationals.

; Step 2.  Next we show that if the code returns T then [i] and [ii] both hold.
; Consider the cases.  If (and a-rel (not b-rel)) is true and we return T, then
; (<= a b).  Thus, [i] is shown by:

; (thm (implies (and (rationalp a)

; Furthermore, given (and a-rel (not b-rel)) we know the domain is not just
; INTEGERP, so it includes all the rationals.  Our existential witness for z is
; the rational given in the let binding below:

; (thm (let ((z (+ a (/ (- b a) 2))))
;        (implies (and (rationalp a)
;                      (rationalp b)

; On the other hand, if (and a-rel (not b-rel)) is false, and we return T
; then (< a b).  We can prove [i] with

; (thm (implies (and (rationalp a)

;                    (< a b))
;               (implies (<? a-rel x a) (<? b-rel x b))))

; But to prove [ii] we must consider whether the domain is INTEGERP or not.  If
; it is INTEGERP, we know a-rel = b-rel = nil and that a and b are integers.
; Thus, [ii] becomes the formula below, with our existential witness being the
; integer shown:

; (thm (let ((z (+ a 1)))

;                      (not (<? a-rel z a))))))

; If on the other hand, the domain is not INTEGERP, then it includes all the
; rationals and we can prove:

; (thm (let ((z (+ a (/ (- b a) 2))))
;        (implies (and (rationalp a)
;                      (rationalp b)
;                      (not (and a-rel (not b-rel)))

;                      (not (<? a-rel z a))))))

; That finishes Step 2.

; Step 3.  Finally, we show that if we return NIL, one of [i] or [ii] fails.
; Again, we consider whether (and a-rel (not b-rel)) holds.  If it does and we
; return NIL then we know (NOT (<= a b)) and we observe that [i] fails for the
; case where x = (+ b (/ (- a b) 2)):

; (thm (implies (and (rationalp a)

; On the other hand, if (and a-rel (not b-rel)) is nil and we return NIL, we

; will first check that the evg in question is not already ruled out by the
; other components.  Then we add it to the neg-evgs.  But what about the
; interval?

; The most general rule is this:

; If the domain is ACL2-NUMBERP and the excepted evg is equal to one of the
; endpoints (meaning the evg is the bound and the corresponding rel is weak),
; we can strengthen the rel.  For example, the interval over the ACL2-NUMBERPs
; such that 5 <= x < 10, when conjoined with x /= 5, produces 5 < x < 10.  (Of
; course, INTEGERP intervals are a special case discussed below.)  The
; following theorem justifies this for ACL2-NUMBERP intervals and the lo bound
; and the symmetric theorem holds for the hi bound.  Since it holds for
; ACL2-NUMBERP, it holds for RATIONALP and INTEGERP intervals too.  However, it
; does not hold for unrestricted intervals.  For example, if the domain is
; unrestricted and 0 <= x < 10, and we add x/=0, we cannot change the lower
; bound to 0 < x < 10, since x='NAN is in the original interval and satisfies
; x/=0 but is not in the changed interval.

; For the defun of <? above:

; (thm (implies (and (rationalp lo)
;                    (rationalp hi)
;                    (<? (or lo-rel hi-rel) lo hi) ; non-empty

;                         (<? hi-rel x hi)))))

; There is an easy-to-fall-for fallacy near here: ``If the domain is
; unrestricted but the tau excludes 0, then the domain ACL2-NUMBERP may be
; added.''  This is based on the valid observation that both (< 0 x) and (< x
; 0) imply (acl2-numberp x).  So if we knew lo < x < hi but x /= 0 then don't
; we know (< 0 x) or (< x 0)?  No!  For example, lo might be -5 and hi might be
; +5.  Now let x be 'NAN.  Then -5 < 'NAN < +5 and 'NAN /= 0, but (acl2-numberp
; 'NAN) is false.

; The special case for INTEGERP intervals should be handled specially.

; If the domain of interval is INTEGERP and the evg is one of the endpoints, we
; can shrink the interval to exclude it.  Recall that the relations for
; INTEGERP intervals are always weak.  Adding x/=5 to the interval over the
; integers 5 <= x <= 10 will turn the interval into 6 <= x <= 10.  (One can see
; this as first 5 < x <= 10 and then shrinking to 6 <= x <= 10, but we'll do it
; in one step.)

; But the INTEGERP case should go on to confirm that the NEW endpoint is not
; excluded.

; For example, the tau:
;   ((integerp x) & 0 <= x <= 10 & x/=2 & x/=1)
; can't be represented any other way.  But if we add x/=0, we
; should produce:
;   ((integerp x) & 3 <= x <= 10)
; and not the more verbose:
;   ((integerp x) & 1 <= x <= 10 & x/=2 & x/=1)
; That is, when shrinking an INTEGERP interval in a tau, continue
; shrinking past all excluded endpoints.

; This function tightens the domain and/or an upper or lower bound on the
; interval in a tau, adjusting the tau's :neg-evgs appropriately.  However, as
; a precondition, we insist that the new domain is either (a) implied by some
; recognizer already in the :pos-pairs or :neg-pairs of tau or (b) implied by
; the existing bounds on the interval, or (c) implied by the new upper-boundp,
; rel, and k.  We return the new tau.  K may be nil (denoting the appropriate
; infinity) or a rational.  It will be adjusted to an integer if the relevant
; domain is INTEGERP.

; Note that using k=nil or domain=nil is a way of saying ``no change of this
; parameter'' since they place no new restrictions and we'll use the existing
; parameter.

; Programming note: We don't explicitly filter :neg-evgs for the new domain, we
; just filter it for the new upper-bound, rel, and k.  This is correct because
; of our precondition.  If condition (a) holds, we know that every element of
; tau's :neg-evgs already satisfies the existing (stronger) recognizer and
; hence must satisfy domain.  (For example, perhaps we are adding domain =
; INTEGERP in response to add-to-tau1 t/POSP.  In adding t/POSP, we will filter
; out of :neg-evgs all those elements that are not POSP, and so we will have
; filtered out all non-INTEGERPs before calling tighten-bound to add INTEGERP
; to the interval.)  Alternatively, if condition (b) holds, the pre-existing
; bounds on the interval imply the domain and hence :neg-evgs are already
; appropriately filtered.  Finally, if condition (c) holds, there may be
; illegal elements of :neg-evgs but they will be removed here when we enforce
; upper-boundp, rel, k.  (For example, we may be adding domain = ACL2-NUMBERP
; in response to adding lower-bound 0 <.  In this case, we'll remove from
; :neg-evgs all non-numeric elements because they fail 0 <.)

; Reminder: This is not all that must be done when adjusting a bound in a tau!
; For example, if the interval is bounded above 0, we could add ACL2-NUMBERP
; (or perhaps POSP), but we don't make ``non-local'' inferences here.  That is
; saved for add-to-tau.

; :neg-pairs (without violating our rule that no recognizer is just a hidden
; equality-to-constant).  Nor will it change the (empty) :pos-evg field.  But
; it might change the interval!  For example, if we have an INTEGERP interval
; with 0 <= x <= 10 and we know x/=8 and x/=9, and we add x/=10, we get the
; interval 0 <= x <= 7 and must eliminate the now redundant elements of
; neg-evgs.  If the interval is merely RATIONALP and we exclude 10, we'd
; strengthen the upper bound to x < 10.  Note that the neg-evgs and the
; interval must be consistent initially, so neg-evgs contains no element
; outside the interval.  So the only way a new neg-evg can affect the interval
; is if the evg is ``equal to one of the endpoints,'' which means that the evg
; is a rational, one of the bounding relations is weak (<=), and the evg is

; to x < 1/2.  (We have already dealt with strengthening integral bounds).
; But this strengthening is only legal if either (a) the domain of the

; we get /= k, we can change the bound to < k only if k/=0.  In particular, if

; example, t/NATP sets the domain to INTEGERP and without this rule we would
; not detect a contradiction from then adding nil/RATIONALP.  One might think
; that there is no way to get a RATIONALP domain except to explicitly add
; t/RATIONALP, so one could argue that the second rule noted above:

; nil/RATIONALP     RATIONALP domain   contradiction [See Note 2 below]

; is unnecessary because we will detect the contradiction in :pos-pairs.
; But it is possible to get a RATIONALP domain without adding t/RATIONALP!

; only element of the first set not in the second is B.  The concept is used in
; firing conjunctive rules.  The conjunctive rule (A & B) --> C is stored as
; the tau {A B -C}.  If we ever encounter a tau such that some conjunctive rule
; is a near subset of it, we can assert the negation of the missing element.
; For example, given the conjunctive rule {A B -C} and tau {A -C D E F G}, we
; can assert -B, to get {A -B -C D E F G}.  Think of the conjunctive rule being
; stated in the contrapositive: (A & -C) --> -B, and the tau as describing some
; object with properties A and -C (among others).  Then the object also has
; property -B.

; Note that if we regard the objects in our sets as terms, we really want to
; know whether the conjunction of the terms in set2 imply all (subset) or all
; but one (near-subset) of the terms in set1.  Typically, set2 describes the
; context we're in and set1 represents a bunch of hypotheses we'd like to
; relieve.  For all the elements but the interval bounds, we just look for
; membership, but for the bounds we look for implication.

; Our functions for checking this property (across various data structures like
; almost lexordered lists, tau-pairs, tau, etc) all follow the convention that
; they return t if every element of the former is in the latter (i.e., the
; subset relation holds), nil if more than one element fails to occur, and the
; unique missing element otherwise.  We are careful that the sets to which we
; apply this concept never contain nil as an element.

; We wish to check the near-subset relation between the neg-evgs of two tau,

; exactly one element of lst1 that is not in lst2.  Our convention is that
; ``near-subset'' functions return t to indicate that every element of the one
; is in the other, nil to indicate that more than one element is missing, and
; otherwise returns the missing element.)  However, suppose x /= 23 is in tau1
; by being in its neg-evgs, while it is not in the neg-evgs of tau2 because
; that evg is ruled out by some pair.  For example, tau1 might be the integers
; except 23, while tau2 might be the even integers.  If the assumption that x =
; 23 allows us to falsify some pos-pair in tau2, then x = 23 isn't really
; missing from tau2, it is swept up by the pos-pairs.  Neg-pairs are, of

; On the Near-Subset Relation for Intervals

; We now develop the code for checking the near-subset relation for intervals.
; However, it is useful to recap why we care about near-subsets.

; Each conjunctive rule is stored as a tau: the rule p1 & ... & pn --> q is
; stored as the tau p1 & ... & pn & -q.  Suppose we have some facts about x,
; expressed as a tau for x, and wish to try to fire a conjunctive rule.  If
; each of the conjuncts in the rule tau are in the factual tau, then we have a
; contradiction.  But if all but one of the conjuncts of the rule are among the
; facts, then we may add the negation of the missing predicate to the facts.
; For example, if we know p1 & ... & pn then we can add q.  More interestingly,
; if we know p1 & ... pn-1 & -q, we can add -pn.  So it is important to be able
; to determine if all but one of the conjuncts of a tau are in another tau.  We
; call this relation ``near subset.''  We will check the near-subset relation
; essentially component-wise, comparing pos-pairs to pos-pairs, neg-evgs to
; neg-evgs, etc.

; But what does it mean to be a near subset if intervals are involved?  Think
; of an interval coding at most two more recognizers, zero or one chosen from
; group LO below and zero or one chosen from group HI:

; LO: (lambda (x) (<= 'lo x))
;     (lambda (x) (<  'lo x))
; HI: (lambda (x) (<= x 'hi))
;     (lambda (x) (<  x 'hi))

; Of course, if there is no upper or lower bound (i.e., the interval is somehow
; infinite) it just means that no recognizer is chosen.

; Now, consider the conjunctive rule: (integerp x) & 0 <= x <= 100 --> (Q x)
; coded as a tau-like object:

; Rule:  (integerp x) & (<= 0 x) & (<= x 100) & -(Q x)

; and a set of known facts:

; Facts:  (integerp x) & (<= x 100) & -(Q x)

; we see that the Rule is a near-subset of the Facts.  One Rule hypothesis is
; missing: (<= 0 x).  That means we can augment the facts with its negation: (<
; x 0).

; Now what if we have even stronger Facts than the Rule requires?

; Rule:  (integerp x) & (<= 0 x) & (<= x 100) & -(Q x)
; Facts: (integerp x) & (<= x 75) & -(Q x)

; Clearly, if x is below 75, it is below 100.  So we can add (< x 0) here too.

; Finally, what if a fact actually contradicts the missing hypothesis?
; Suppose we have:

; Rule:  (integerp x) & (<= 0 x) & (<= x 100) & -(Q x)
; Facts: (integerp x) & (< x -100) & -(Q x)

; Again, the Rule is a near subset of the Facts.  In particular, we know
; (integerp x), we know (<= x 100) -- indeed, x is negative, and we know -(Q
; x).  The missing hypothesis is (<= 0 x).

; But this hypothesis is actually contradicted by (< x -100).  So we shouldn't
; add its negation.  Why?  What if we did?  What if we added the "new" fact (<
; x 0).  We haven't helped.  We already know (< x -100).

; So we need to be able to compare the inequality hypotheses of a rule with
; some inequality facts and determine whether (a) all the hypotheses are true
; according to the facts -- in which case we have a contradiction since
; conjunctive rules are stored the way they are, or (b) there is exactly one
; hypothesis missing from the facts and it is not contradicted by the facts --
; in which case we can add its negation to the facts, or (c) multiple
; hypotheses are missing and we do nothing.

; So now we need to be able to answer the question: given a single inequality
; fact can we determine whether a single inequality hypothesis is true? Is
; false? Is unknown?

; We next define tau-interval-endpoint-implication which takes a ``fact,'' A, a
; ``hypothesis,'' B, and decides whether the hypothesis is true given A, false
; given A, or undecided.  Below is a macro definition used solely to justify
; the definition of this function.

; The macro contains a table with columns labeled (A x), (B x), C, and Z.  The
; meaning of each row in this table is:

; ``Thm:  C <--> [forall x : (A x) --> (B x)]

;   Proof: C --> ((A x) --> (B x)) is obvious.  The other direction is proved by
;   first instantiating the universal x with Z and then proving ((A Z) --> (B Z))
;   --> C.  Q.E.D.''

; The commented-out code below actually checks these entries.

; The success of confirm-ABC-table means that the entries in the above table
; are correct.  Thus, we know that

; [forall x : (A x) --> (B x)]

; is a theorem if the condition in column C is true.

; For example, consider a function call (fn a) and imagine that we know that
; the actual, a, has tau A.  But imagine that the signature of fn requires B.
; Then if C is true, the signature requirement is satisfied.  Alternatively, we
; might have a Conjunctive Rule, which when applied to the term a, produces the
; literal (B a).  If we know (A a) then we know (B a) holds, provided C is
; true.

; We are also interested in the situation in which (A x) means that (B x) is
; false.  That can be investigated by considering:

; For example, suppose we have a lower bound, A: (< 20 a), among our facts.
; Suppose the rule has the hypothesis B: (<= 15 a).  We want to know whether
; the hypothesis, B, follows from the fact A.  These two choices of A and B
; correspond to line 2 in the table, with k = 20 and d = 15.  So we ask
; question C, (<= 15 20).  The answer is T, so we know that the hypothesis B is
; satisfied.  However, if B were (<= 25 a), then C would become (<= 25 20) and
; we could not relieve B.

; Note that every row contains a NIL in C or C'.  So if we index into the table
; for a given A and B and find a non-NIL comparison term in C, then the table
; might tell us that B is true (if C evaluates to true), but cannot tell us
; that B is false (because C' will be NIL).

; If on the other hand we index into the table for a given A and B and find a
; NIL in C, the table cannot tell us that B is true but it MIGHT be able to
; tell us that it is false, by checking the condition in the C' column.

; For example, consider A: (<= x 20) and B: (< 25 x).  This is line 9.  Here, C
; = NIL, so the table cannot tell us that B is true.  However, looking at the
; C' column we see the test (<= 20 25), which is true.  So we know B is false.

; Finally notice that the A in lines 1-8 are lower bounds and those in lines
; 9-16 are upper bounds.  Similarly, every block of B has two lower bound cases
; (e.g., lines 1 and 2 in the first block) and two upper bound cases (lines 3
; and 4).  A lower bound can sometimes establish that another lower bound
; holds; a lower bound can never establish that an upper bound holds but can
; sometimes show that an upper bound is false.  The situation is symmetric with
; respect to upper bounds.  These remarks only apply to finite (i.e., rational)
; bounds; if the bound in the conclusion is infinite, of course the implication
; holds.

(defun tau-interval-endpoint-implication (ap arel k bp brel d)

; Ap and bp should be named ``a-upper-boundp'' and ``b-upper-boundp''

; This function takes the interval-level descriptions of the endpoints of two
; intervals.  The first three formals, ap, k, and arel, describe one bound of
; an interval and the next three, bp, d, and brel, describe another.  We call
; these two bounds A and B respectively.  The coding is

; Finally, a literal translation of the table, say for lines 16 and 15 below would
; ask whether brel is t or nil and test (<= k d) for the one and (<= k d) for

(defun tau-interval-near-subsetp (interval1 interval2)

; This is loosely analogous to tau-pairs-near-subsetp, but for the interval
; components.  This function returns (mv sign k rel), where rel = T means
; both bounds of interval1 are implied by those of interval2, rel=NIL means
; neither bound is implied (or one is definitely false), and otherwise rel is
; :lessp-x-k or :lessp-k-x and sign, k, and rel represent the missing element.

; Recall that one set is a near subset of another if all but one element of the
; first is a member of (is implied by) the second.  Here we're not interested
; in membership but in implication.  For example, the lower bound 0 < ...  is
; implied by the lower bound 100 < ...

; We ignore the domain of interval1 and just try to establish the bounds of
; interval1 from those of interval2.  Why?  We assume that interval1 comes from
; some tau, say tau1, which corresponds to a theorem in the sense that we code
; conjunctive rules as tau.  The domain in the interval of tau1 is implied
; either by other recognizers in tau1 or by the bounds themselves.  Thus, if we
; have a tau representing a conjunctive rule and we were to add the domain in
; as a conjunct, we could remove it from the theorem.  I.e., the domain really
; is irrelevant to conjunctive rule firings.

; So we may think of an interval as representing just (at most) two conjuncts,
; two imaginary ``tau-pairs'', one recognizing (<? lo x) and the other
; recognizing (<? x hi).  These recognizers exist only if their respective
; bounds are non-nil.  So we just need to check whether (<? lo x), if present
; in interval1, is implied by interval2, and similarly for (<? x hi).  If we
; find exactly one missing, we return ``it.''

; (Unlike the near-subset comparison for neg-evgs, this function can confine its
; attention to the intervals of the two taus in question:  only an inequality can
; establish an inequality.)

; Our convention for other ``near-subset'' functions is that they return t (to
; indicate that every element of the first is in the other), nil (to indicate
; that more than one element is missing), or the missing element.  That would
; be inefficient here because the missing ``tau pair'' is represented by three
; objects that we'd have to cons up, e.g., a missing upper bound (<= ... k) is
; represented as a negatively signed (k . :lessp-k-x).  So this function
; ``accumulates'' and returns three things, the missing sign, k, and token.  If
; the returned token is t is means we found all of interval1 in interval2.  If
; the returned token is nil both bounds were missing.

; Also unlike the others, an interval can actually say more than just
; that a bound is ``missing'', it can say the bound is false.  We
; treat the discovery of a false bound as we would the discovery that
; multiple elements are missing, so as to avoid the application of
; the rule.

; In terms of tau-interval-endpoint-implication, the endpoints of interval1
; provide our Bs, the endpoints of interval2 provide our As, and we are trying
; to decide the questions A --> B and A --> -B for each combination.  If any B
; comes back false or multiple Bs come back unknown, we quit with NIL (which
; might always be interpreted by our caller to mean ``multiple recognizers are
; unknown'' but, when discovered meant ``one recognizer is simply false and so
; you can't productively assume its negation''), if every B comes back true, we
; report T (meaning all the hypotheses are true), and otherwise, exactly one B
; is unknown and we return ``it.''  But what we actually return is (mv
; missing-sign missing-k missing-token) where if missing-token is t or nil we
; mean ``all found'' or ``multiple missing'' (or ``one false''), and otherwise
; missing-token is :lessp-x-k or :lessp-k-x and missing-sign and missing-k are
; the other pieces of the missing sign/recog.

; In the following we use ``A lo'' to mean the lower bound of interval2, ``B
; lo'' to mean the lower bound of interval1, etc.  We use ``A lo --> B lo'' to
; mean the question: ``does A lo imply B lo (t), the negation of B lo (nil), or
; is it unknown (?)?''

; If that returns t, we're done and return t (in a triple).  If either test
; returns nil, we return nil (in a triple).  But if ``A lo --> B lo'' returns
; ?, we have to try ``A hi --> B lo'' because it might report that B lo is
; false.  (For example, A might be [15 <= ... <= 20] and B might be [30 <=
; ... ...].  (<= 15 x) does not establish that (<= 30 x), so we get ? on the
; ``A lo --> B lo'' comparison.  But we get NIL on ``A hi --> B lo'' because
; (<= x 20) means (<= 30 x) is false.)  Similar remarks apply if ``A hi --> B

; element.  We return (mv contradictionp sign recog), where the last two are
; nil when contradictionp is t.

; Some of the possibilities below don't really make sense -- we'd never be
; presented with a Conjunctive rule tau1 consisting of a :pos-evg.  But we
; behave as per the spec above just to keep the interface clean.  The main
; thing to remember is that we need only look for :neg-evgs, :pos-pairs,
; neg-pairs, and :interval bounds of tau1 in the corresponding components of
; tau2.

; Imagine computing the five component-wise near-subsetp answers.  For each
; obtain a signed answer, sign1/temp1, sign2/temp2, etc, where if tempi = t,

; contradiction: (mv t nil nil).  If exactly one tempi is the missing element
; and other tempi are t, we won: (mv nil signi tempi) for the i that was
; witnessed.  Otherwise, we fail.

; Efficiency considerations: By cascading the (null tempi) checks we avoid even
; computing tempi for those i beyond the first failure.  Furthermore, if any
; tempi is nil, temp4 is nil.  And we don't actually have to remember most

; On the Tau Database

; We build a database from certain kinds of theorems, as shown below.  In the
; forms shown, p, q, p1, p2, ..., are all understood to be tau recognizers (and
; thus may be (fn x), (EQUAL x 'evg), (< x 'rational), or (< 'rational x),
; and/or their negations.

; Simple:
; (implies (p v) (q v))

; Conjunctive:
; (implies (and (p1 v) (p2 v) ...) (q v))

; Signature [form 1]
; (implies (and (p1 x1) (p2 x2) ...)

; The first three properties are called ``tau recognizer properties'' and the
; other fn specific properties are called ``tau function properties.''  A
; recognizer symbol may have both kinds of properties, e.g., it may be
; unevalable-but-known and may be a big-switch.

; Closure of Simple Rules under Contraposition and Transitivity

; We now turn to implementing the closure operations.  We close the simple
; rules under contraposition and transitivity.  The function tau-put, given for
; example, (p x) --> (q x), will store it by adding q to the pos-implicants of
; p.  Since q is just a signed tau recognizer and the pos-implicants of p is
; just a tau, tau-put uses add-to-tau1 to store q in the pos-implicants of p.

; The driver and main function of simple rule storage is tau-put*, which (i)
; uses tau-put to handle (p x) --> (q x), then (ii) uses tau-put to handle the
; contrapositive -(q x) --> -(p x), then (iii) calls itself recursively to
; propagate the addition of q to pos-implicants of p, and then (iv) calls
; itself recursively again to propagate the addition of -p to neg-implicants of
; q.

; This note concerns how tau-put handles p-->q, for arbitrary signed tau
; recognizers.  It may update the tau database or not, depending on the
; formula.  It may also signal that a contradiction has been detected.  But
; things may get complicated when p and/or q is either an
; equality-with-constant or one of the two inequalities-with-constants,
; :lessp-x-k or :lessp-k-x.

; For example, x='A --> (p x) usually tells us nothing because (a) if we ever
; compute that a term has the tau {'A} then we will use evaluation to determine
; what other tau predicates it satisfies, and (b) most predicates are evalable
; and so (p 'A) either evaluates to T or to NIL.  So tau-put uses evaluation to
; determine whether there is anything to store.  If (p 'A) computes to T,
; tau-put stores nothing; in the case where it computes to NIL, tau-put signals
; a contradiction.  But there is a third case: x='A --> (p x) could be provable
; but (p 'A) might not be evalable.  In this third case, tau-put would add (p
; 'A) = T to the UNEVALABLE-BUT-KNOWN property of p.

; Tau-put's treatment of p-->q is asymmetric. Even though p-->q and its
; contrapositive, -q-->-p are logically equivalent, we may do something in
; response to the one and do nothing in response to the other.  For example, (p
; x) --> (q x) causes updates to p's pos-implicants and its contrapositive
; causes updates to q's neg-implicants.  But there is only one thing we can
; learn from x='A --> (p x) and that is, at most, that p is unevalable but true
; on 'A.  There is no point in attempting to store that fact for both x='A -->
; (p x) and its contrapositive -(p x) --> x/='A.  So tau-put does not always
; act on every version of every formula.

; To make sure we cover all the cases, we build a table of possibilities and
; describe the appropriate action by tau-put.

; How we build the Tau-Put Table

; We consider all the formulas of the form p-->q, where p and q are any of the
; signed tau recognizers.  For each choice of p and q, we determine what we can
; learn (i.e., store in the database) from the discovery that p-->q is a
; theorem.  To make it easier to think about, we let p take on the following
; four forms (handling both signs explicitly later below).
;
; (p x)    ; p represents some arbitrary monadic Boolean function symbol
; (= x a)  ; = represents EQUAL and a stands for an arbitrary quoted constant
; (< x i)  ; i represents an arbitrary quoted rational constant
; (< i x)  ; i represents an arbitrary quoted rational constant

; Similarly, we let q take on

; (q x)
; (= x b)
; (< x j)
; (< j x)

; where b and j are constants analogous to a and i above.  For each choice of p
; and each choice of q, we will consider

;  p -->  q
;  p --> -q
; -p -->  q
; -p --> -q

; This methodology produces a ``contrapositive variant'' for each formula but
; assures that we cover all the cases.  For example, formulas 1 and 4 of the
; table below are contrapositive variants of each other.  In the table this is
; noted this way:

; 1 ( 4)   (p x) -->  (q x)
; 4 ( 1)  -(p x) --> -(q x)

; because if we take the contrapositive of either and swap the roles of the
; symbols p and q we get the other formula.  More interestingly, formulas 8 and
; 17 are contrapositive variants, where here we also swap the roles of a and b.

; 8 (17)  -(p x) --> -(= x b)
;17 ( 8)   (= x a) -->  (q x)

; The contrapositive variants noted in the table below were mechanically
; identified, so you may assume it is a complete and accurate identification.

; Why is this notion relevant?  First, contrapositives are, of course,
; equivalent formulas.  Furthermore, p, q, a, b, and i, and j merely represent
; arbitrary examples of symbols or terms of certain syntactic classes.  If our
; analysis calls for the same action on a formula as on its contrapositive,
; then there is no point in coding tau-put to recognize and act on both forms.
; So for example, our reaction to formula 8 above is to try to evaluate the
; function symbol bound to the pattern variable P on the constant bound to the
; pattern variable b and if it is unevalable we store the fact that the
; function is unevalable but true on that constant.  This is the same thing
; we'd do on formula 17, where we'd name the function and constant q and a but
; then carry out the same actions.  So we do not do anything on formulas of
; form 17 because we know we will deal with the contrapositive sometime.

; On the other hand, if our analysis calls for different actions on the
; different forms, then the fact that one is the contrapositive variant of
; another is irrelevant.  (Note that 22, 23, 42, 43, 62 and 63 are their own
; contrapositive variants and are marked with ( *).)

; We indicate actions in the table as follows:

; code    action                                                        update?

; S       store the obvious add-to-tau1 into the database              yes
; U       may tell us some fn is unevalable but known                   maybe
; V       violates Non-Constant Non-Equality                            no
; N       no action     (mv Nil nil wrld)                               no
; T       contradiction (mv T   nil wrld)                               no
; W       wait for contrapositive                                       no
; if ...  describes one of two outcomes, either N or T                  no

; Apology: It may seem odd to use N to code for no action (e.g., the formula is
; trivially true) and T to code for contradiction, but those action codes make
; it easier to reconcile the table entries with the code because no action (N)
; is coded as (mv Nil ...) and contradiction (T) is coded as (mv T ...).

; We sometimes use an if in the table.  For example, x=a --> x=b is either
; trivial (N) or contradictory (T), depending on whether constants a and b are
; equal.  But sometimes we use arithmetic inequalities in these tests.  For
; example, x=a --> x < j is trivial if a < j but contradictory otherwise.
; However, when coding these comparisons remember that while i and j are known
; to be rational constants, a and b are not and the proper interpretation of
; ``a<j'' is (< (fix a) j).

; We had to think about some of the actions and so put justifying notes or
; references to proofs or demonstrations of unsatisfiability in brackets.  For
; example,

; 23 ( *)  -(= x a) -->  (= x b)    T [demo: let x=(cons a b)]

; means that the formula is unprovable in a consistent theory, as can be
; demonstrated by proving the negation of an instance:
; (thm (let ((x (cons a b)))
;        (not (implies (not (equal x a)) (equal x b)))))

; Some other lines have notes like ``[pf 5]'' referencing proofs (enumerated by
; the line number of the formula in question) presented at the end of the
; table.  In these demonstrations and proofs, A, B, I, and J are not
; instantiable!  They're constants!

; -----------------------------------------------------------------

; A coding question: The table above guides our coding of tau-put below.  But
; when we say ``signal contradiction'' we mean we are logically justified in
; signaling a contradiction.  We are also logically justified in just ignoring
; the situation: if the theory is inconsistent, it is still sound to not report
; it!  For example, consider lines 21--24.

; 21 (24)   (= x a) -->  (= x b)    if a=b, N else T
; 22 ( *)   (= x a) --> -(= x b)    if a=b, T else N
; 23 ( *)  -(= x a) -->  (= x b)    T [demo: let x=(cons a b)]
; 24 (21)  -(= x a) --> -(= x b)    W -- wait for (21)

; We get to these lines if both p and q are signed equalities -- conditions we
; check by observing that (cdr p-recog) and (cdr q-recog) are both nil.  Lines
; 21 and 22 would have us test whether the two constant arguments of the
; equalities are equal, and either do nothing or signal a contradiction.  Line
; 23 would have us signal a contradiction.  And line 24 would have us do
; nothing.  To determine which action to take, we have to test the signs and
; the constants.  But just doing nothing in all four cases is sound and faster.
; On the other hand, the situation will probably never arise since the user is
; not likely to prove any formula of these forms so the efficiency is of little
; concern.  Really, how likely is it that we'll see theorems like (implies
; (equal x 23) (equal x 27)) or (implies (equal x 23) (equal x 23)) proved as
; rules?

; Is the danger of bugs in our code worth the extra robustness of testing for
; explicit contradictions?

; After some consideration of this issue, we decided to code the table
; precisely, if only to document the analysis and make the case analysis
; uniform.

; Now, regarding the order in which we enumerate the cases.  The table suggests
; that we look first for recognizer function applications, then equalities,
; then the two inequalities.  But recall the concrete representation of tau
; recognizers as shown in tau-like-term and consider programming the necessary
; tests.  Efficiency suggests we test for equality first, then the two
; inequalities, and handle function applications as the final case.  The basic
; decoding of a concrete tau recognizer, recog, is as follows:

; Tests in order tried          term represented by recog     evg var name

; (eq (cdr recog) nil)         `(EQUAL X ',(car recog))       a or b
; (eq (cdr recog) :lessp-x-k)  `(< X ',(car recog))           i or j
; (eq (cdr recog) :lessp-k-x)  `(< ',(car recog) X)           i or j
; otherwise                    `(,(cdr recog) X)              p or q

; Note that as we try the tests we bind variables a, b, i, and j to the
; corresponding evgs and we bind p and q to the corresponding function symbols
; to make our code match the names used in our table.

; Note: while our table shows ``terms'' like (= x a) the corresponding term is
; `(EQUAL x ',a).  That is the variable a in our code corresponds to the evg of
; quoted constant denoted by a in our table.

(defun tau-put (p-sign p-recog q-sign q-recog ens wrld)

; Each of p-recog and q-recog is a concrete tau recognizer with the
; corresponding sign.

; Think of the two signs and two recognizers as representing signed recognizers
; p and q.  This function is called on every simple tau rule, p --> q.  It will
; also be called on the contrapositive.  We implement the actions listed in the
; Tau-Put Table and we reproduce lines from that table to document what we're

; On Closing the Database under Conjunctive Rules

; At one point we considered closing the database under the conjunctive rules,
; in so far as we could.  We knew that we had to keep conjunctive rules around
; anyway and use them at query time because at query time we are given a list
; of knowns and must consider what the conjunctive rules tell us about that
; particular combination of recognizers.  But it seemed like possibly a good
; idea to also use the rules on the database itself.  But that is very
; complicated.  Suppose we have a db closed under everything (including
; conjunctive rules).  Then we add p-->q.  This will touch the implicants of p
; (to add q and all the things q implies), -q (to add -p and all the things -p
; implies), and for every r in the implicants of q, -r (to add -p), and for
; every s in the implicants of -p, -s (to add q), and so on.  Every one of
; those implicant lists has to be closed again under conjunctive rules.  So we
; would need to track all the recs we change, not just whether we changed
; anything.

; Furthermore, if a conjunctive rule is added, we have to close every implicant
; list in the world again.

; Finally, how common will it be for the user to have told us that (a & b) -->
; c, and then told us that p --> a and p --> b?  Certainly it will happen,
; e.g., if p is added after the primitive types a, b, and c, have been defined.

; It turns out that this happens a lot.  For example, in the Rockwell benchmark
; used to test early versions of this (in which all :type-prescription and
; :forward-chaining rules were interpreted as :tau-system rules) we mapped over
; all the tau recognizers and asked how often does a conjunctive rule fire on
; the implicants (positive and negative).  The answer was that of 11,940
; implicants stored in the database, 4,640 of them could be extended with
; conjunctive rules.

; -----------------------------------------------------------------
; On Converting Theorems in the World to Tau Rules

; We populate the database by processing certain theorems.  However, we do
; this both when an event is first processed (in install-event) and also when
; the tau database is regenerated (regenerate-tau-database).  We call this
; ``visiting'' the event; obviously, there is a first visit.  That is,
; sometimes when we visit an event we've already processed it once.

; Recall also that theorems are added to the tau database either because they
; are explicitly labeled :tau-system rules or because we are in automatic mode
; and the theorems are of the appropriate form.  This is also done when we
; visit an event, rather than in the core code for each event.  This is a
; deliberate design decision to bring all the tau database updates into one
; place so we can implement regenerate-tau-database more robustly.

; The following code deals with recognizing the shapes of theorems that can be
; represented as tau rules and adding those rules to the database.  We
; ultimately define the function for visiting an event (tuple) and adding its
; rules.

; Tau Boolean rules tell us that a function symbol is a monadic Boolean and
; thus should be tracked by the tau system.  These rules cause the function
; symbol to get a tau-pair and cause its pos- and neg-implicants to be
; appropriately set.  However, when in automatic mode, tau also automatically
; recognize monadic Boolean functions introduced by defun (or
; mutual-recursion).  For that reason, we first define the function that visits
; a function symbol after its introduction and sets up its tau properties.
; We'll then use that function to add Boolean tau rules.

; On Tau-Like Terms

; We need to recognize terms that are suitable applications of signed tau
; recognizers.  We call these ``tau-like'' terms.  Technically, a term is
; ``tau-like'' if it is either (pred e) or (NOT (pred e)) where pred is a tau
; recognizer.  Recall that to be a tau recognizer, pred must be a function
; symbol with a tau-pair or be one of the built-in variants of EQUAL or <.  If
; a term is tau-like, then the ``subject'' of that tau-like term is e.

; For later work we need to identify when a list of terms are all tau-like (and
; perhaps about a common subject or about various subjects but all of which are
; variable symbols).  Our code is simpler if we elaborate the tau-like check
; with certain criteria on the subject.

; criteria          meaning
; :VARIOUS-ANY      subjects may vary and may be any term
; :SAME-ANY         subjects must all be the same but may be any term
; :VARIOUS-VAR      subjects may vary but must all be variable symbols
; :SAME-VAR         subjects must all be the same variable symbol
; term              subjects must be term

; The way we enforce a criterion across a list of terms is to change certain
; of the keyword criteria into term criteria as we go.  For example, to check
; that a list of terms satisfy :VARIOUS-ANY we check that criterion for each
; term, but to check that a list of terms satisfies :SAME-ANY or :SAME-VAR we
; shift the criterion from the input one to whatever subject we find in the
; first term we check.

(defun tau-like-subject-criterion (criterion x)

; Criterion is one of the criteria above and x is a term that is the subject of
; a tau-like term.  We return nil if x does not meet criterion; else we return
; the next criterion to use in checking subsequent allegedly tau-like terms with
; this same criterion.  Thus, this function is both a predicate indicating
; whether x meets the criterion, and a function used to select the next
; criterion when mapping across a list of terms.

  (case criterion
    (:VARIOUS-ANY :VARIOUS-ANY)
    (:SAME-ANY    x)
    (:VARIOUS-VAR (if (variablep x) :VARIOUS-VAR nil))
    (:SAME-VAR (if (variablep x) x nil))
    (otherwise (if (equal criterion x) criterion nil))))

;     (equiv x '1))                      equiv-terms are swapped.)

; To be ``tau-like'' term must be a possibly negated term of one of the forms

; terms.  The returned e is the subject of the term and meets the input

; list of terms to determine if they are all tau-like in the given sense.

; Warning: This function could treat (IFF x NIL) like (NOT x).  It could treat

; expand-tau-like-proposition where also consider looking into IFF and EQUAL.

;     the only variable free in x, and v is a switch for both y and z, or

; Note that any variable that does not occur freely in term is (pathologically)
; a switch for the term.  But let's confine our attention to variables that
; occur freely in term.

; If v occurs freely in term and is a switch for term, then term must begin
; with an IF and the test must be a recognizer on v.  Thus, at most one
; variable occurring freely in term is a switch for term.

; We say an unconditional equation defines a ``big switch function'' if the
; equation is of the form

; (equal (fn v1 ... vk) body)

; where fn is a function symbol, fn is not a tau recognizer, the vi are
; distinct variables, the free vars of body are a subset of the vi, and one of
; the vi is free in body and is the switch for body, and body does not call fn.
; The largest subterms of body that do not contain the switch var are called
; the ``leaves'' of the switch.

; Note that it is possible for a big switch equation to define a function fn
; about which we also have signatures.  In this case, the tau mechanism will
; ignore the big switch definition.  That is, the presence of a signature in
; tau overrides the possibility of expanding the function.

; A bounder correctness theorem is parsed into the following
; record:

(defrec bounder-correctness
  ((subject-fn . acceptable-domains)
   .
   (bounder-fn . bounder-args))
  t)

; Here, subject-fn is the function symbol whose value is constrained to the
; interval computed by bounder-fn.  Both are function symbols.
; Acceptable-domains codes the domain requirements on the arguments to
; subject-fn; it is a list of elements in 1:1 correspondence with the actuals
; of subject-fn: each element is a list of interval domain recognizers,
; indicating that the corresponding actual must lie in an interval over one of
; the listed domains or that no restriction is made.  The last field of a
; bounder-correctness record is a list of numbers, in 1:1 correspondence with
; the arguments of bounder-fn, indicating which actual interval is to be passed
; to bounder-fn in each position.

; For example, here is a bounder correctness theorem for the function fn:

;  (implies (and (tau-intervalp int1)
;                (tau-intervalp int3)
;                (or (equal (tau-interval-dom int1) 'integerp)
;                    (equal (tau-interval-dom int1) 'rationalp))
;                (equal (tau-interval-dom int3) 'integerp)
;                (in-tau-intervalp x int1)
;                (in-tau-intervalp z int3))
;           (and (tau-intervalp (bounder int3 int1))
;                (in-tau-intervalp (fn x y z) (bounder int3 int1))))

; and here is the corresponding bounder-correctness record which
; represents this theorem:

; (make bounder-correctness
;       :subject-fn         'fn
;       :acceptable-domains '((INTEGERP RATIONALP)
;                             (INTEGERP RATIONALP ACL2-NUMBERP NIL)

;       :bounder-fn         'bounder
;       :bounder-args       '(2 0))

; If tau-term sees a call of fn, it determines the tau of the arguments (or at
; least those with non-T acceptable-domains) and checks that each tau contains
; an interval with an acceptable domain.  If so, it collects the intervals of
; the tau in the positions listed in :bounder-args (in the order listed) and
; applies bounder to that list of arguments to get an interval known to contain
; the fn term.

; Note for future improvement: When we check whether a rule (of any class) is

;  remove-guard-holders
;  unprettyify
;  strip-force-and-case-split-in-hyps-of-pairs
;  split-on-conjoined-disjunctions-in-hyps-of-pairs

; to get a list of (hyps . concl) pairs that we then inspect for suitability
; under the tau constraints.  This is done in three places.  The places are
; shown below and the notation ``fn < gn'' should be read as ``fn is called by
; gn'':

; chk-acceptable-tau-rule < chk-acceptable-x-rules (on :tau-system rules only)

; add-tau-rule <
;  tau-visit-defthm1 < tau-visit-defthm < TAU-VISIT-EVENT < [see below]

; tau-rules-from-type-prescriptions <
;   tau-visit-defuns1 < tau-visit-defuns < tau-visit-defun < TAU-VISIT-EVENT
;                                        < TAU-VISIT-EVENT

; Note that add-tau-rule and tau-rules-from-type-prescriptions are essentially
; only called from TAU-VISIT-EVENT, which is called by install-event (and
; during regenerate-tau-database, which is so rare we will ignore it).  Recall
; that while one might expect add-tau-rule to be called by add-x-rule it is
; not: tau rules are added by the install-event.

; It is of some concern that the nest of preparatory functions (like
; strip-force-and-case-split-in-hyps-of-pairs and
; split-on-conjoined-disjunctions-in-hyps-of-pairs) causes too much consing.
; So there are two questions: (a) Can we prepare the hyps for the tau
; constraint checks without repeatedly copying them?  (b) Do we prepare the
; hyps multiple times for the same rule?

; When a :tau-system rule is proposed, we prepare the hyps for each rule twice:
; once when we check that the rule is an acceptable tau-system rule and then
; again when we store it in install-event.  We cannot avoid this unless we save
; the prepared (hyps . concl) pairs from before the proof and feed them to
; install-event.  But this is quite a paradigm shift from the current and
; widely used interface with install-event so we chose not to do it.  On the
; other hand, when a :rewrite or other class of rule is proposed, we prepare
; the hyps only once: when we try to add it (optionally) as a tau rule.

; Since the vast majority of rules are presumably not :tau-system rules, we're
; willing to live with the current redundancy for :tau-system rules.  If we
; come to believe that the preparatory processing of rules for tau is costing
; too much, it is probably best to focus first on question (a) above: preparing
; more efficiently (or checking without preparing).

; A useful little test is to define foo, trace one of the preparatory functions,
; and then add a rule, either as a :tau-system rule or as a :rewrite rule.  Note
; how many times we prepare the rule for checking.

; On the Tau Msgp Protocol

; Several of the functions that add tau rules obey the Tau Msgp Protocol.  In
; that protocol, we return (mv msgp wrld), where msgp is either nil or an error
; message to be handled (signaled) by some caller of the function in question.
; When msgp is nil, wrld is the properly extended wrld.  When msgp is non-nil,
; wrld is the original wrld passed into the function, not some partially
; updated extension.  That is, functions obeying the msgp protocol are No
; Change Losers on wrld.  Most functions following the protocol take an
; additional argument, wrld0, as the ``good'' wrld to preserve.

; The reason we have the protocol is that we cannot always make tau rules out
; of previously approved :tau-system formulas because the ens has changed and
; some previously identified tau recognizers are no longer identified as tau
; recognizers.  This may or may not be an error, depending on lost-rune-action.
; When not an error, we just accumulate those lost runes on the global value of
; 'tau-lost-runes.  The possibility that we should actually signal an error
; arises when we are processing the original introduction of the :tau-system
; rule, where the explanation of the inadequacy of the syntactic check is due
; to it having been done in the first pass of an encapsulate that failed to
; export the Boolean property to the second pass where the error is to be
; signaled.

(defun add-tau-rule1 (lost-rune-action rune pairs ens wrld wrld0)

; We try to convert each (hyps . concl) pair in pairs to a tau rule and extend
; wrld accordingly.  We obey the Tau Msgp Protocol and return (mv msgp wrld').
; Wrld0 is the original world we started with and will be returned in the error
; case, as per the protocol.  Pairs was derived by unprettyify from some
; :corollary for a rule named rune.

; Lost-rune-action determines what we do if we encounter a term that cannot be
; coded as a tau rule.  If lost-rune-action is IGNORE, we quietly ignore such
; terms.  If lost-rune-action is REPORT, we return a non-nil error message.
; This can happen if we're in the second pass of an encapsulate and discover
; that a function that was Boolean during the first pass is no longer known to
; be Boolean.  If lost-rune-action is ACCUMULATE then we add the rune of the
; lost rule to the 'tau-lost-runes list in wrld.

; We now turn to the topic of ``visiting'' events and building up the tau

; chronological sweep of the world to regenerate the tau database under a
; different enabled structure.  But from tau's perspective, every visit to an
; event is (almost) like the first time.  This means that it must essentially
; erase any tau properties before starting to add the ``new'' ones.

; We have already defined tau-visit-function-introduction where we clear the
; tau properties of a function symbol.  This is not necessary on the first
; visit to a DEFUN because we know the symbol is new.  Furthermore, on an
; ENCAPSULATE event, it is too late to initialize the tau properties of the
; constrained functions when we see the encapsulate event!  So we visit
; function introductions when we see FORMALS properties stored on the world and
; we don't consider that part of the (re-)visits to events.

; What does tau learn by visiting a defined function?  (a) Whether the function
; is a tau recognizer.  (b) Whether the function's type-prescription(s) are tau
; signature rules.  (c) Whether the function's definitional equation is a
; big-switch rule.  (d) Whether the function's definitional equation is an

; the -preds version below) is only called by tau-visit-defuns, which will have
; just introduced the new name fn.  However, it is possible that fn is being
; redefined.  In that case, either we Erased old properties or else we are
; Overwriting.  In the former case, the re-initialization here is still
; correct.  In the latter case, one might argue that we should not
; re-initialize because we're supposed to just add to existing properties.  But
; the tau implicants already stored under fn and derived from its now-obsolete
; definition may be quite extensive.  We think it is quite likely that adding
; new deductions to those implicants from this new definition will produce
; inconsistency.  Therefore, we make the arbitrary decision to Erase the tau

; clausify.  The following code is a cheap and dirty approximation of clausify
; used just to process non-recursive propositional definition bodies containing
; only tau recognizers.

; To see the need for more than stripping, define a recognizer as a disjunction
; of other recognizers, e.g., (DEFUN FOO (X) (OR (A X) (B X) (C X) (D X))).  To
; make it easier to play, let's just think of proposition letters:

; FOO <--> (A v B v C v D).

; We want to store a tau rule of the form (A v B v C v D) --> foo.
; If we express that as an IF we get

; (IF (IF A 'T (IF B 'T (IF C 'T D))) FOO 'T)

; which normalizes to

; (IF A FOO (IF B FOO (IF C FOO (IF D FOO 'T))))

(defun subsumes-but-for-one-negation (hyps1 hyps2 ancestor-lits)

; First, think of hyps1 and hyps2 as merely sets of literals.  This function
; returns either nil or identifies a literal, lit, in hyps1, whose complement,
; lit', occurs in hyps2, and such that the result of removing lit from hyps1 is
; a subset of hyps2.  It ``identifies'' that literal by returning the non-nil
; list whose car is lit' (the element of hyps2) and whose cdr is ancestor-lits,
; i.e., (cons lit' ancestor-lits).  We call lit' an ``ancestor literal'' in
; this context.

; However, what we check is weaker than the spec above.  Our requirement on
; this function is that when it is non-nil. the result is as described above.
; However, if the function returns nil it does not mean there is no such lit!
; It only means we failed to find it.

; What we actually check is this: Let lit be the first literal of hyps1 that is
; not equal to its counterpart at the same position in hyps2.  Let tail1 be the
; remaining literals of hyps1.  Let tail2 be the tail of hyps2 starting with
; the counterpart of lit.  Then we insist that somewhere in tail2 the

; occurrence of lit' is in ancestor-lits, and that tail1 is a subset of the
; rest of tail2 from the point at which lit' was found.  We return either nil
; or (cons lit' ancestor-lits) depending on whether these conditions hold.

; Thus, if this function returns non-nil, the lit' it identifies occurs in
; hyps2, occurs complemented in hyps1, and all the other literals of hyps1 are
; in hyps2.

; In this function, one may think of ancestor-lits merely as heuristic
; ``permissions'' to scan deeper into hyps2 to find the complement of lit.  But
; in subsequent functions it will play a crucial soundness role.

; On Removal of Ancestor Literals -- The Satriani Hack Prequel

; Pair1 is a (hyps . concl) pair, say (hyps1 . concl1) and pairs is a list of
; such pairs.  We ``clean up'' pairs with a very limited one-pass
; ``subsumption-replacement'' loop.  The idea is to use pair1 to clean up the
; first pair of pairs, pair2, producing new-pair2.  Then we use new-pair2 to
; clean up the next pair of pairs, etc.  The tricky bit is the use of
; ancestor-lits, which is accumulated from all the pairs we've cleaned up and
; the maintenance of which is crucial to soundness.  This entire body of code
; is reminiscent of the Satriani Hack, which is actually a little more
; elaborate (and slower) because it checks for subsumptions we don't here.

; We can ``use pair1 to clean pair2'' if the following three conditions hold:
; (a) they have the same concls, (b) there is a literal, lit, of the hyps of
; pair1 that appears complemented in the hyps of pair2, and (c) removing lit
; from the hyps of pair1 produces a subset of the hyps of pair2.  Note that
; conditions (b) and (c) are assured by subsumes-but-for-one-negation, which
; treats ancestor-lits merely as heuristic permissions to scan further.

; If we can use pair1 to clean up pair2, and the complement of the identified
; lit is lit', then we ``clean up pair2'' by removing from its hyps not just
; lit' but all the ancestor-lits!

; In the discussion below we call lit' the ``ancestor literal'' of the cleaned
; up pair2.  The ancestor literal of a newly derived pair is the literal
; removed from the parent pair.  Its complement occurs as a hyp in an earlier
; pair and that earlier pair's other hyps all occur in the newly derived pair.

; For example, if pair1 is ((A B C) . concl) and pair2 is ((A -B C D) . concl)
; then we can use pair1 to clean up pair2 and the process of checking that
; identifies -B as an ancestor literal.  Cleaning up pair2 produces pair2', ((A
; C D) . concl) and -B is the ancestor of literal of that pair in the context
; of this derivation.

; Why is it sound to clean up this way?  We start with two observations.

; Observation 1.  If we have two theorems of the form ((H1 & p) --> c) and ((H2
; & -p) --> c), where H1 is a subset of H2, then we can replace the second with
; (H2 --> c).  This is most easily seen by putting the first into
; contrapositive form, ((H1 & -c) --> -p), and observing that we can then
; rewrite the -p in the second theorem to T.

; Observation 2: We maintain the following invariant about ancestors-lits and the
; ``current'' pair (the car of pairs), which we call pair2 in the statement of
; the invariant:

;    for every element, lit' (with complement lit), of ancestor-lits there
;    exists a pair, say pair', among those we have already collected such that
;    the concl of pair' is the concl of the pair2, lit occurs in the hyps of
;    pair', and the remaining hyps of pair' form a subset of the hyps of pair2.

; If this invariant is true, then we can remove every ancestor-lit from pair2.
; The previous pair' can with Observation 1 to remove each ancestor.  Note that
; lit' may not appear in the hyps of pair2.

; One might wonder what gives us the right, subsequently, to remove the
; ancestor lit of pair2 from the next pair encountered, even though we just
; check that those hyps, which may be missing lit', are a subset of the next
; pair.  The invariant insures we can.  But if this conundrum bothers you,
; just add lit' as a hyp to pair2: it is never unsound to add a hypothesis to a
; theorem!  [The key part of the invariant is that, except for lit, the hyps of
; pair' are members of the hyps of pair2.]

; The invariant in Observation 2 is clearly true when ancestors-lit is nil, and
; inspection of the code below shows that we make it nil when the concls of two
; successive pairs are not equal and when the hyps of one are not in the
; appropriate subset relation with the next.  The only time we add a lit' to
; ancestors-lit we know that lit is a member of the hyps pair1 (which we
; collect) and that the rest of the hyps of pair1 are a subset of the hyps of
; pair2.  Since subset is transitive, we know that the pairs from which the
; ancestors lit descend (minus the lit in question) are all subsets of the hyps
; of the last pair collected.

; Here is an example of this process:

; Suppose we have:
; pairs                                 pairs'                      ancestor-lits
; [1] x y  A u --> concl                [1'] x y A u --> concl
; [2] x y -A  B u v --> concl           [2'] x y B u v --> concl           -A
; [3] x y -A -B  C u v w --> concl      [3'] x y C u v w --> concl      -B -A

; ----- let's consider the next step ---

; [4] x y -A -B -C  D u v w z --> concl [4'] x y D u v w z --> concl -C -B -A

; By the time we use [2] to clean up [3] to produce [3'], we're the state shown
; above the ``let's consider'' line.  We will next produce [4'] from [3'] and
; [4].  Using Observation 1, [3'] allows us to knock off the -C from [4]
; because the concls of [3'] and [4] are the same and the hyps of [3'] are a
; subset of those of [4] except for the literal C which appears negated in the
; hyps of [4].  -C is the ancestor literal of this step.

; We thus get to remove -C from [4] and add -C to the ancestor lits going
; forward.  But we also get to remove the other ancestor lits, -B and -A.  We
; show why below.

; Why can we remove -B? By the invariant, we know there exists a pair' among
; those we have already collected such that the concl of pair' is the concl of
; the [4], B occurs in the hyps of pair', and the remaining hyps of pair' form
; a subset of the hyps of [4].  The pair' in question is [2'] and it allows us
; to drop -B from [4].

; Why can we remove -A? By the invariant, we know there exists a pair' among
; those we have already collected such that the concl of pair' is the concl of
; [4], A occurs in the hyps of pair', and the remaining hyps of pair' form a
; subset of the hyps of [4].  The pair' in question is [1'] and it allows us to
; drop -A from [4].

; In this example, all the ancestor lits are in the current pair.  But that need
; not be true.  For example, imagine that [4] did not contain -A.

; [4] x y    -B -C  D u v w z --> concl [4'] x y D u v w z --> concl -C -B -A

; The presence of -A in ancestors still means there is a collected pair, pair',
; that would allow us to delete A because the other hyps of pair' are a subset
; of [4].  We know the subset relation holds because the hyps of [1'] (minus A)
; are a subset of [2'], the hyps of [2'] (minus B) are a subset of those of
; [3'], and the hyps of [3'] (minus C) are a subset of those of [4].  So we
; COULD delete -A even if it weren't there!

; The function remove-ancestor-literals-from-pairs below is the top-level
; entry to this process.  It takes a list of pairs, uses the first one as
; pair1 and the rest as pairs.  The initial ancestor-lits is nil.

; Here are some examples of the function in action.  These examples show how we
; are sensitive to the order of the literals.  This sensitivity is deemed
; unimportant because stripping the branches of normalized IFs produces the
; regular order that we exploit.

;   (remove-ancestor-literals-from-pairs
;    '(((x y  A        u) . concl)
;      ((x y (NOT A)  B        u v) . concl)
;      ((x y (NOT A) (NOT B)  C        u v w) . concl)
;      ((x y (NOT A) (NOT B) (NOT C) D u v w z) . concl)))
;   =
;   (((x y A u) . concl)
;    ((x y B u v) . concl)
;    ((x y C u v w) . concl)
;    ((x y D u v w z) . concl))

; However, if we permute the first pair we fail to get any of the -A, but we do
; knock off the -B, -C, and -D:

;   (remove-ancestor-literals-from-pairs
;    '(((x A  y        u) . concl)
;      ((x y (NOT A)  B        u v) . concl)
;      ((x y (NOT A) (NOT B)  C        u v w) . concl)
;      ((x y (NOT A) (NOT B) (NOT C) D u v w z) . concl)))
;   =
;   (((x A y u) . concl)
;    ((x y (not A) B u v) . concl)
;    ((x y (not A) C u v w) . concl)
;    ((x y (not A) D u v w z) . concl))

; Similarly, if the second pair fails the subset test, we start over.

;   (remove-ancestor-literals-from-pairs
;    '(((x y  A           u1) . concl)
;      ((x y (NOT A)  B        u1 v) . concl)
;      ((x y         (NOT B)  C        u2 v w) . concl)
;      ((x y (NOT A) (NOT B) (NOT C) D u2 v w z) . concl)))
;   =
;   (((x y A u1) . concl)
;    ((x y B u1 v) . concl)
;    ((x y (not B) C u2 v w) . concl)
;    ((x y (not A) (not B) (not C) D u2 v w z) . concl))

; Note that we do not get to knock off the -B in the third pair or the -A and
; -B in the fourth, because u1 is not u2.  We would actually be justified in
; knocking off the -C in the fourth, but we fail to find it because -A is
; blocking the subset check for going deep enough to find the -C.  We would get
; the improved result if we permuted the fourth input pair:

;   (remove-ancestor-literals-from-pairs
;    '(((x y  A           u1) . concl)
;      ((x y (NOT A)  B        u1 v) . concl)
;      ((x y         (NOT B)  C        u2 v w) . concl)
;   ; On the next line, moved the -A to end.
;      ((x y         (NOT B) (NOT C) D u2 v w z (NOT A)) . concl)))
;   =
;   (((x y A u1) . concl)
;    ((x y B u1 v) . concl)
;    ((x y (not B) C u2 v w) . concl)
;    ((x y (not B) D u2 v w z (not A)) . concl))

; Returning to the first, classic, example but changing the concl of the last
; two rules:

;   (remove-ancestor-literals-from-pairs
;    '(((x y  A        u) . concl1)
;      ((x y (NOT A)  B        u v) . concl1)

; we see we simplify the two concl1 pairs and the two concl2 pairs, but we

; On the Motivation for Tau-Subrs

; Consider two tau recognizers, A and B, and their conjunction as another tau
; recognizer, AB.  Suppose we know the theorem (AB x) --> (AB (fn x)) as a tau
; signature rule.  Then does tau prove that same theorem?  No!

; The reason is that preprocess-clause, which tries tau-clausep, expands some
; functions.  It will expand the (AB x) in the hypothesis, because it is a
; conjunction, but it will not expand it in the conclusion.  The result is that
; tau-clausep is presented with: ((NOT (A x)) (NOT (B x)) (AB (fn x))) and
; without some more work, tau does not know know that A & B --> AB.  That is
; the role of tau-subrs below.  It essentially recognizes nonrecursive
; conjunctions of tau and adds the appropriate tau rules in both directions:
; (A & B) --> AB and AB --> A and AB --> B.

; Below is an example.  The first thm below failed until tau-subrs was implemented.

; (defun A (x) (integerp x))
; (defun B (x) (< 1000 x))

; (defun AB (x) (and (A x)(B x)))

; We disable B to keep the example simple.  As an extra stressor on tau during
; this experiment, we leave A enabled so that its (trivial) conjunctive nature
; must be also exploited by tau.

; (in-theory (disable fn B))

; This should succeed whether AB is enabled or not.  The first thm failed

; or (or (A x) (and (B x) (C x))) but may not contain interesting non-tau

; Next we implement the tau visit to a defthm event.  In manual mode, all we do
; is add the ens-enabled explicit :tau-system rules originally introduced by
; this event.  In automatic mode, we mine each of the ens-enabled
; non-:tau-system rules.  But there are four nuances.

; First, what if an event has both :tau-system and non-:tau-system rules and we
; are in automatic mode?  Do we look for tau rules among the non-:tau-system
; rules?  Our answer to that is no: if the user mentions :tau-system rules in
; an event, we assume that those are the only tau rules wanted.  We think it
; would be too confusing if the user has to think about the impact of his
; non-:tau-system rules while being explicit with his :tau-system rules.  If
; there is no mention of :tau-system rules and we're in automatic mode, we look
; for implicit rules.

; Second, how does the ens affect this analysis?  What if an event has an
; explicit :tau-system rule and it is disabled in ens?  Do we act as though
; that rule class were not present and look for implicit rules?  Or does the
; presence of a :tau-system rule, even a disabled one, signal that the user did
; not intend for the other rules to be mined?  Our answer is that the presence
; of a :tau-system rule signals that nothing automatic should be done, even if
; the :tau-system rule is disabled.  Note that an event might have several
; :tau-system rules, under different runes, and some might be enabled and other
; disabled.  Still, our analysis is the same: Any :tau-system rule in the
; original event means we look only at :tau-system rules and add the ones that
; are enabled.

; Third, this whole discussion suggests that an event has "enabled rules" but
; the chain of possession is more involved.  An event name has (truncated)
; rule-classes and runic-mapping-pairs (which are in 1:1 correspondence),
; truncated rule-classes each have a :corollary keyword (or not, in which case
; the event's theorem is to be used), rules are derived from corollaries, rules
; have runes, and runes are enabled or disabled.  So we have to deal with this
; mapping.

; Fourth, what do we do if an explicit :tau-system rule cannot be stored as a
; tau rule?  This will not happen during the original execution of the
; introductory event: chk-acceptable-rules will detect the problem and signal a
; soft error.  But it is possible in subsequent visits to a :tau-system rule.
; For example, perhaps a monadic function symbol that was previously
; recognized as Boolean is no longer so recognized because of ens.  We believe
; that even a soft error in this situation is unduly harsh.  The user is
; unlikely to know ahead of time that the ens will have that effect.  Our
; design is to keep a list of ``lost'' runes to be printed at the end of the
; regeneration process.  However, this means we must know while processing
; corollaries whether we are to signal an error or add the rune to the lost
; runes.

; DEFCHOOSE introduces a function symbol.  But at the time of this writing the

; defchoose event make fn a monadic Boolean?  Not syntactically.  We come close
; with:

; (defchoose pick-a-bool (x) (y) (booleanp x))

; from which one could prove (booleanp (pick-a-bool y)).  So the axiom that
; exists after the defchoose is not syntactically acceptable for a tau Boolean
; rule and the revelation that pick-a-bool is in fact Boolean only comes via a

; On the Tau Completion Alist (calist)

; We call the process of extending a tau with conjunction rules ``completion.''
; Completion can be quite expensive.  We therefore remember all the tau we have
; completed in a given proof and look up the answers when we can.  We use a
; simple alist mapping input (partial) tau to output (completed) tau.  The
; alist, called calist, is accumulated throughout an entire proof and is stored
; in the pspv when we're not in tau.  This mechanism may become too expensive
; if there are a lot of different partial tau involved in a proof.  But out
; experience so far is that the number is reasonable.

; For example, consider the community book
; books/centaur/vl/transforms/xf-expr-simp.lisp and the event within it:
; (verify-guards vl-expr-simp).  If one modifies these sources so as to ignore
; the values found in the calist (just choose the second t clause below) then
; the verify-guards event named above takes about 42 seconds to process (on a
; 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 with 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 Macbook Pro).  If one uses the
; values in calist, then it takes about 6 seconds.  In all, 50 different
; partial tau are mentioned in this proof.  Completion is called about 41,000
; times on these various tau -- some as many as 6,000 times each.  49 different
; complete tau are generated.  27 of the 50 partial tau are changed by
; completion and the other 23 are actually already complete.  (Note that since
; we know that the val we compute is complete, we could pair it with itself on
; the new calist.  However, this does not gain anything in this particular
; test.  Apparently we often compute tau and do not even try to subsequently
; complete them so remembering the already completed ones is not much help.)

; Dealing with Terms

; We now turn our attention to computing the recognizer sets of terms
; and maintaining a list of assumptions about terms.  We start by
; using signature rules.  Then we will define how to use an alist of
; tau assumptions to compute the tau of a term.  Then we will define
; how to build an alist of tau assumptions.

; A slightly confusing fact about signature rules is that both form 1 and form
; 2 rules are the same.  The first applies to expressions like (fn a b) and the
; second applies to expressions like (mv-nth 'i (fn a b)).  To fire a rule, we
; just need to know whether a and b have appropriate tau (and whether the
; dependent hyps are relieved).  If a rule fires, we just need to know the sign
; and recog for the value produced.  We don't actually need to know fn or i or
; even which form of rule we are applying.

(defun all-tau-emptyp (lst)
  (cond ((endp lst) t)
        (t (and (equal (car lst) *tau-empty*)
                (all-tau-emptyp (cdr lst))))))

(defun all-unrestricted-signature-rulesp (sigrules)

; In general, when we see (fn a1 ... an) we will obtain the taus of the actuals,
; and then apply the signature rules of fn to (tau1 ... taun).  However, if all
; the rules for fn have unrestricted inputs, e.g., rules like: (fn *tau-empty*
; ... *tau-empty*) ==> sign/recog as happens for cons (consp), reverse
; (true-listp), member (boolean), etc., there no point in even getting the tau
; of the actuals.  Of course, we must also make sure there are no dependent
; hyps.

; On Disjoining Tau

; In trying to compute the tau of (IF a b c), we compute the tau of b and c and
; disjoin them.  Because taus are conjunctions of all the things we know,
; disjoining them is akin to intersecting their representations.  This reduces
; the number of recognizers in them and hence enlarges the set of objects in
; the tau.  For example, if b has a tau that includes P and Q and c has a tau
; that includes P and R, their disjunction includes P but not Q or R.

; We lose a lot of precision in disjoining tau.  Here are two examples.

; For example, b might include RATIONALP and hence also ACL2-NUMBERP; c might
; include INTEGERP and hence also ACL2-NUMBERP; But their disjunction just
; includes ACL2-NUMBERP.  We've lost that it is an integer or a rational.

; Intervals raise another problem.  To take an extreme case, suppose the tau of
; b and c are both equalities-to-constant, say =0 and =100.  Then their
; respective intervals are 0 <= ... <= 0 and 100 <= ... <= 100 and when we
; ``disjoin'' them the only interval we can create that captures both is 0 <=
; ... <= 100.

; Another problem has to do with the fact that some recognizers that ``ought''
; to be in a tau are removed when the tau becomes an equality-to-constant.  For
; example, we might have two taus both of which contain WEEKDAYP.  But then we
; might assert ='MONDAY into one and ='TUESDAY into the other.  These explicit
; constants subsume all the :pos-pairs that compute true on them, and we would
; then drop the WEEKDAYP recognizers from each tau.  But now if we disjoin the
; two tau, we get the empty tau, even though it would have been legitimate to
; produce {WEEKDAYP}

(defun disjoin-intervals (interval1 interval2)

; The two arguments are tau-intervals.  We form the interval that stretches
; from the lower lower bound of the two to the upper upper bound, and has as
; its domain the less restrictive of the two domains.

; Motivation: Suppose we are finding the tau of (IF a b c) and suppose we have
; computed the tau of b and c and that they have intervals interval1 and
; interval2.  Then a tau for (IF a b c) will have the interval we compute
; here.

; The domain of the new interval is the most less restrictive of the two.  For
; example, if one is INTEGERP and the other is RATIONALP, we choose RATIONALP,
; since the first interval is also an interval over the rationals.  Note that
; the only way we can produce an INTEGERP interval is if both are INTEGERP.
; One implication is that the chosen endpoints are known to satisfy the
; requirement on INTEGERP intervals of using the relation <= (nil) and integer
; extends, since both endpoints come from INTEGERP intervals.

; A more problematic issue is whether the new domain is derivable from the
; :pos-pairs of the tau into which we put this interval.  Our computation of
; the :pos-pairs of the new tau will insure that it is because we will
; explicitly include INTEGERP, RATIONALP, or ACL2-NUMBERP as needed.  But it
; was not recognized at first that this would be necessary.  In particular, it
; was thought naively that since the domain was derivable from the :pos-pairs
; of both ancestor taus, it would be derivable from their disjunction.  But
; that argument is naive because it forgets that the :pos-pairs of
; equality-to-constants is empty!  (Recall that when a tau becomes an
; equality-to-constant, we just save those recognizers that won't evaluate
; appropriately on that constant, thus representing all others implicitly.)

; While this handling of the domains of intervals is accurate as far as it
; goes, we really lose a lot of precision in disjoining taus.  See the
; discussion On Disjoining Tau.

; Tau-Term and Tau-Assume

; Tau-term is the function that takes a term and an alist of tau assumptions,
; tau-alist, and computes the tau of the term under the assumptions in
; tau-alist.  Tau-assume takes a term and tau-alist and augments the tau-alist
; with the assumption that the term is true (or false as specified by a flag).

; These two functions are mutually recursive.  However, before we get to their
; definitions we must deal with various auxiliary issues and helper functions.

; On the Role of Rewriting in Tau

; We have gone back and forth on the question of whether tau-term and
; tau-assume should do any rewriting.  The existence of mutually recursive
; recognizers is the motivation of our decision to do some rewriting.  If
; recognizers are mutually recursive then the system will involve ``big
; switch'' recognizers that turn into standard recognizer nests depending on
; the value of some flag.  (Think of the flagged version of a mutually
; recursive clique of recognizers, except replace the singly recursive calls
; with their mutually recursive but now disabled counterparts.)  We must expand
; these big switches when their controlling flags are known.  It also pays to
; do this expansion in the context of some tau assumptions, since that permits
; simplification.  If we do not do this rewriting in the tau system we spill
; over into the simplifier where much more heavy-duty machinery is invoked.

; But how should rewriting in tau interact with signature rules?  Our current
; policy is that rewriting will not expand a function that possesses a tau
; signature rule.  The idea is that if the user has provided a signature rule,
; that is what we use.  If no signature rule is provided and the function is a
; big switch, we consider expanding it.

; Given this simple heuristic, how do we handle (mv-nth 3 (fn a b))?  Clearly
; if there is a form 2 signature rule for this we apply it.  But if not, we
; expand (fn a b) and look for a signature rule about the result.  In the happy
; event that (fn a b) is a big-switch-like function and expands to (gn b),
; we're in good shape.  But if it expands into an IF, we push the mv-nth
; down to the tips of the IF before recurring.

(defun tau-term (term tau-alist type-alist pot-lst ens wrld calist)

; Basic Design of tau-term:

; Given a term, a tau-alist, a type-alist and a pot-lst compute the tau of the
; term.  We return either a tau or *tau-contradiction*.

; If a term is bound on tau-alist, we just look up its tau.  We do not
; implement the ``double-whammy'' idea of type-set.

; Tau-term gives special handling to certain function calls:

; - lambda applications: expand and recur.  This is as opposed to an Abstract
;   Interpretation approach where we might compute the tau of a lambda
;   application by computing the tau of the body under the alist pairing the
;   formals to the tau of the actuals.  We tried it both ways and expansion
;   actually seems to result in very slightly fewer calls of tau-term.

; - (NOT x):  compute the tau of x, taux, and return the tau for T or NIL
;   if taux is the tau of NIL or T, respectively; else return the tau for
;   Boolean

; - IF: If the test must be true (or must be false) under tau-alist, compute the
;   tau of the appropriate branch; otherwise, compute the tau of each branch
;   under the appropriately augmented tau assumptions and then intersect the two
;   recognizer sets.

; - (UNSIGNED-BYTE-P 'n x) where (natp n):  expand definition to conjunction

; - (MV-NTH 'i (fn ...)) where fn has form 2 signature rules: apply the ith set
;   of signature rules for fn.  We also handle mv-nth synonyms here.  Thus, for
;   synonyms we do not look for signatures or big-switch expansions.

; - (MV-NTH 'i (fn ...)) where fn is a big switch: expand the fn call (if
;   heuristically allowed), distribute the (MV-NTH 'i ...) down to the tips of
;   any IF thus produced, and recur.  We also handle mv-nth synonyms here and
;   do not consider signatures or big-switch expansions for them.

; - (MV-NTH x y) for any other combinations of x and y: *tau-empty*.  We also
;   handle mv-nth synonyms here and do not consider signatures or big-switch
;   expansions for them.

; - sign/(recog e): compute the tau of e and return the tau for T, NIL, or
;   Boolean appropriately

; - (EQUAL x y): if the intervals of the taus of x and y allow the equal
;   to be decided, return the appropriate tau; else apply signature rules
;   for EQUAL (which probably is just Boolean)

; - (< x y):  analogous to EQUAL above

; - (fn ...) where fn has bounder rules and/or form 1 signature rules: compute
;   the tau of each actual, then apply the bounder rules to compute a tau
;   containing (fn ...), and then further refine it with the applicable
;   signature rules.  The existence of a bounder or signature rule us from
;   opening the function or considering it as a big switch.

; - (fn ...) where fn is a big switch: Expand (if heuristically allowed) and
;   recur

; Once upon a time, we assumed the term T first and didn't ``bother'' to assume

; realized (via a bug reported by Dmitry Nadezhin) that it's possible for the
; NIL assumption to tell us that the T assumption should have produced mbt1=T:
; Suppose (P x) is defined to recognize just 0 or 1.  Now suppose we know (via
; tau-alist) that (P x) is true.  Assume (INTEGERP X) true.  We get nothing but
; a new tau-alist because we don't deduce right then that (P X) --> (INTEGERP
; X).  But when we assume (INTEGERP X) false we get a contradictionp2 because
; we can carry that assumption into (P X).  So we learn mbt1 should have been T
; from a contradictionp2!  So now we go both ways on the assumptions and figure
; out what we know.  We could try to short-circuit the computation above by not
; doing the assume false if the assume true told us the answer.  But it is
; possible the assume false will tell us a different answer, in which case we
; have detected a contradiction in the world or tau-alist.  By doing both we
; treat assume true and assume false symmetrically; the short-circuit destroys
; that symmetry.

; So now we ``figure out what we know.''  This is realized by setting the
; variables contradictionp, mbt, mbf, true-tau-alist, and false-tau-alist
; according to all we've learned from the two assumptions (T and NIL) above
; which generated six variables, contradictionp1, mbt1, mbf1 (generated by
; assuming term true) and contradictionp2, mbt2, mbf2 (generated by assuming
; the negation of term true).  We assume that whenever an mbti or mbfi flag is
; set the corresponding tau-alisti is the appropriate extension of tau-alist.

; Below is a table showing all possible combinations of the six flags we now
; hold, where ctr1 and ctr2 are abbreviations for contradictionp1 and
; contradictionp2.  (BTW: This table was generated by forming all combinations
; of the six boolean flags and then filtering out the impossible combinations,
; namely, those in which the contradictionp is T while either mbt or mbf is T,
; and those in which mbt and mbf are T.)  Depending on the combination of
; flags, we set contradictionp, mbt, mbf, true-tau-alist and false-tau-alist;
; we obey the following constraints:

; (a) at most one of contradictionp, mbt, and mbf can be T

; (b) if either mbt or mbf is t, the true- and false-tau-alists are the
;     original tau-alist

; (c) if both mbt and mbf are nil, the true- and false-tau-alists are
;     appropriate extensions of the original tau-alist.

; Note that the only time we extend the tau-alist to get true-tau-alist and
; false-tau-alist is when we learn nothing by assuming the term true and
; nothing by assuming the negation of the term true.  In all other cases,
; the true- and false-tau-alists are just the original tau-alist.

; Below we show a case split on the combinations.  We state in English what
; each combination means and what we deduce from it, because we found it easy
; to make coding mistakes.  The ``short answers'' are ``try both!'' (we learned
; nothing and have the appropriate extensions), ``mbt!'' (term must be true),

;   not ``x is a NATP, where x is the tau of A'' (whatever that means).  Also,
;   see the mention of the abstract interpretation method tau-term above.

; - (IF a b NIL) and other forms of conjunction:  assume both conjuncts

; - (UNSIGNED-BYTE-P 'n x) where (natp n):  expand definition to conjunction

; - (recog a): add recog (and its implicants) to the tau of a as computed under
;   tau-alist

; - (fn ...) where fn is a big switch:  expand the big switch if heuristically
;   allowed and recur

; - otherwise, just use the basic technique of adding nil or non-nil to the
;   tau of the term

; Note on a Possible Extension of Tau-Rewrite: We have considered adding other
; kinds of expansions, e.g., with ABBREVIATION rewrite rules or with
; unconditional ``nonrec'' DEFINITION rules.  We quote nonrec because sometimes
; alternative definitions have non-trivial recursivep fields, indicating that
; they are mutually recursive with other functions.  But sometimes these other
; functions are full fledged tau recognizers (now effectively disabled) and the
; ``recursive'' definition in question is just an abbreviation for some nest of
; those.  To handle this the tau database would need to have a set of
; unconditional rewrite rules for which rewrite termination was guaranteed.
; Such a set might be formed by looking at all alternative definitions and
; layering them.  Let's say a function is ``tau primitive'' if it is an ACL2
; primitive (e.g., IF) or a tau recognizer.  Let's say function gn is
; ``earlier'' than fn if the absolute-event-number of gn is less than that of
; fn.  Then layer 0 functions are the tau primitives.  Layer 1 functions are
; those defined in terms of earlier functions and/or layer 0 functions.  Layer
; 2 functions are those defined in terms of earlier functions and/or layer 0 or
; 1 functions.  Etc.  Any function not so classified is a member of a mutually
; recursive clique and its definition involves another such function.
; Equations for such functions would be ignored, i.e., when setting up the tau
; database we create a set of unconditional rewrite rules only for those
; functions assigned some layer.  But until we see the need for this we will
; not add other forms of rewrite rules.

; On Tau-Clause -- Using Tau to Prove or Mangle Clauses

; Now we develop the code for tau-clause, which processes a clause with tau
; information.  In the first cut at this design, tau-clause transformed a
; clause into a provably equivalent clause.  In particular, it could delete a
; literal known to be false given the other literals.  We call this the
; ``deleted literal'' problem below.  It causes real problems in the
; regression.  If a literal, say lit, is dropped from a clause because of tau
; reasoning then that literal had better be derivable by non-tau reasoning just
; as if it were in the clause (e.g., by type-set) if it is involved in the
; eventual proof of the clause by type-set, rewrite, etc.

; The regression exposed two kinds of commonly occurring problems related to
; literal deletion.  One was where the user had introduced (perhaps by a hint)
; hypothesis like (rel-prime-moduli '(11 13 17)) and did not want it to
; disappear and so disabled the executable-counterpart of the function
; involved.  Sometimes this happened accidently: users would be operating in a
; minimal theory in which almost everything was disabled and then after the
; hint they would employ rules that had been designed (only) to operate with
; these literals explicitly around.  Such scripts could be reworked to enable
; the hyp to evaporate, but we just turned the tau system off and reverted to
; the old proof.

; The second common instance of the literal deletion problem is when a
; signature rule, perhaps proved as a rewrite rule rather than as
; type-prescription, allowed tau to delete a key literal.  We saw many examples
; of literals like this evaporating: (integerp (mv-nth 1 (foo x y))).

; The deletion of literals is a problem because the tau system has no way to
; tell type-set what is knows.  So allowing tau to drop a literal turns out to
; have caused a large number of changes in the regression suite (relative to
; that for Version_4.3).  In general, tau can damage a proof script in two
; ways: the literal deletion problem and the subgoal renaming problem.  The
; latter happens when tau proves one of the several clauses that used to be
; generated by simplification, causing subsequent clauses to have new clause
; ids -- which becomes a problem if a hint is stored under the old clause id.

; As of August, 2011, with the first tau implementation on top of Version_4.3,
; the following community books were changed to support a regression with Tau
; System enabled.  The "i + j" notes in the left margins mean that i disablings
; of tau-system were inserted into the book to deal with literal deletion
; problems and j disablings were inserted to deal with subgoal renumbering
; problems or other more basic problems (e.g., coi/util/extra-info-test.lisp
; uses a must-fail event to show that a certain theorem is not provable while
; some things are disabled and tau must be among them!).

; In order to deal with the literal deletion problem, we changed the design so
; that tau no longer deletes literals known (by it) to be false!  By making tau
; no longer delete literals we reduced the number of modified books to just
; those last eight above.  To find the required modifications, search the
; relevant books for tau-system.

; Returning to the design of tau-clause, there is the standard problem of
; tail-biting.  Because of performance considerations, we have adopted a cheap
; approach: reorder the clause in a heuristic way and then process each literal
; in turn, tau-assuming only the literals to its left in the (re-)ordering.

; To support literal deletion (perhaps someday, when tau can communicate to
; type-set) we must be able to return a simplified clause to its original
; order.  To facilitate this we annotate the clause, converting it to a list of
; triples, where one component of the triple controls the ordering for purposes
; of tau-assume and the other component controls the ordering for re-assembling
; the final answer.  (The third component is, of course, the literal itself.)
; Given that we don't support literal deletion, one of these components is
; simply ignored right now.

; But this still leaves the tau-assume order to be determined.

; The original heuristic was to identify each literal with a key term, which
; was the recognizer subject of the literal.  Thus, (integerp v) and (not
; (equal v 'evg)) both had the key term v, and non-recognizer literals were
; their own key terms.  Then we sorted by term-order on the key terms.  But
; this failed to get a typical kind of clause arising in Dave Greve's work.
; Consider a clause containing among its literals both (not (big-switch flg
; x)), where conditions on flg allow big-switch to dive to something useful
; like (integerp x), and the literal (integerp (fn x)).  Suppose there is a
; signature rule on fn that tells us it returns an integer if given one.  Such
; a clause would be recognized as true if the big-switch is processed first.
; But it is not recognized as true if the big-switch is processed second.  The
; problem, of course, is that (big-switch flg x) could be of either ``kind'' --
; a helpful ``context setter'' or an appeal to a signature rule.  We can't know
; until we dive into it.  Worse, we can't know until we dive into it WITH THE
; RIGHT context!  That is, (big-switch flg x) might expand to (integerp x) if
; we have assumed (integerp (fn x)) true and might not otherwise.  So we might
; be in the impossible situation of having to try every ordering or even to
; iterate, e.g., assume (integerp (fn x)), then process (big-switch flg x) and
; other literals in some order, learn that (integerp x), and then look at
; (integerp (fn x)) again -- all while not biting our own tail.

; So we punted and decided to ``trust the user'' to present these problematic
; literals in the order required!  Least problematic are recognizer literals
; about variables, so we'll do them first.  In fact, we'll put the negative
; variable equality literals first (they are hypotheses of the form (EQUAL var
; 'evg)) and all the other ``variable recognizer'' literals in order (though
; their order doesn't matter).  And otherwise, we will leave the literals in
; the order given.  The rationale of this ``trust the user'' idea is: guard
; verification requires that tests govern usage.

; We want to assign numbers to literals so that when the literals are ordered
; ascending according to the assigned numbers, the negative variable equalities
; are first, then the remaining variable recognizers, and finally the remaining
; literals -- with all literals within a block ordered as given.  We could do
; this with lexicographic ordering but arithmetic is simpler since there are a
; finite number of indices for any given clause.  Let max be the number of
; literals in the clause.  We assume max > 0.  Let i be the position of a given

; Regenerating the Tau Database

; Because tau does not track which runes it is using, disabling a rune has no
; effect on the inferences tau makes.  However, we do provide the ability to
; recompute the tau database with respect to a given enabled structure.  This
; is an event command and we cannot actually define the entire event command
; until we have more infrastructure in place.  (The regenerate-tau-database
; event is defined in other-events.lisp.)  But we can do the hard work, which
; is mapping over the world and re-visiting every event for its tau rules.

; The regeneration facility first clears the tau global variables.  Then it
; revisits every tuple in the world, in chronological order, and calls the
; appropriate tau-visit function on each relevant tuple.  The only relevant
; tuples are those that declare new function symbols and those that mark event
; boundaries, i.e., triples of the forms (fn FORMALS . (v1 ... vn)) and
; (EVENT-LANDMARK GLOBAL-VALUE . ev-tuple) We look out for the
; exit-boot-strap-mode event-landmark because there we switch the boot-strap
; setting of auto-modep to the user-specified setting.  Visiting the tuples in
; chronological order is hard to do efficiently because of the length of the
; world (about 87,000 at the moment), so we just reverse the world, collecting
; only the tuples of interest.
