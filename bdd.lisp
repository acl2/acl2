; by changing how we deal with close to 16 args in op-hash-index1, and by
; changing 131 in if-hash-index.

(defmacro mvf (x &rest rest)

; We often wish to pass back a multiple value such that the first value is a
; fixnum.  Efficiency is apparently improved in GCL when that fixnum is not
; "boxed," but instead is treated as a raw C integer.  Currently ACL2 provides
; mechanisms for this, but they require that an appropriate THE expression
; surround such a value when it is the first value passed back by MV.  (Note
; that there seems to be no way to keep GCL from boxing fixnums in other than
; the first argument position of MV.)

  `(mv (the-fixnum ,x) ,@rest))

        (list 'ash (list 'the-fixnum x) (list 'the-fixnum y))))

(defmacro mx-id-bound ()

; This bound on mx-id must be such that our calls of +f and *f involving mx-id
; produce fixnums.  At this writing the most severe such test is in
; op-hash-index1; see the comment there.

  (1- (floor (fixnum-bound) 153)))

(defmacro 1+mx-id (x)

; DILEMMA:  Do we let this macro box (1+ x) or not, and if so, when?  Here are
; some thoughts on the issue.

; Use this macro to increment mx-id,in order to guarantee that mx-id remains a
; fixnum.  X is known to be a nonnegative fixnum; this macro checks that we
; keep it a fixnum by adding 1 to it.  It actually checks even more, namely,
; that

  `(the-fixnum
    (let ((x ,x))
      (declare (type (signed-byte 30) x))

; Should we really include the declaration above?  The main reason seems to be
; in order for the incrementing operation below to run fast, but in fact we
; have done several experiments and it seems that the current version of this
; code is optimal for performance.  That's a bit surprising, since each mx-id
; gets consed into a list anyhow (a cst), and hence is boxed in GCL (which is
; the only list we are talking about here).  So, there wouldn't appear to be
; any particular advantage in wrapping the-fixnum around this form.  At any
; rate, the performance issues here seem to be quite minor.

; A typical use of this macro is of the form

;  (let ((new-mx-id (1+mx-id mx-id)))
;    (declare (type (signed-byte 30) new-mx-id))
;    (let ((new-cst (make-leaf-cst
;                    new-mx-id
;                    term
;                    nil)))
;      (mvf new-mx-id
;           ...)))

; Note that make-leaf-cst will box new-mx-id -- after all, it is consing
; new-mx-id into a list.  The present approach delays this boxing until that
; time, so that we don't have to unbox new-mx-id in the mvf form above.  The
; unboxed new-mx-id may actually never benefit from being unboxed, and in fact
; we may want to rework our entire bdd code so that mx-ids are always boxed.

      (cond ((< x ,(mx-id-bound))
             (1+f x))
            (t (the-fixnum ; the-fixnum call may help with proclaiming

                    x)))))))

(defmacro bdd-error (mx-id fmt-string fmt-alist bad-cst ttree)

; Perhaps it would be more "natural" to define this macro to return

; `(mvf ,mx-id ,(cons fmt-string ,fmt-alist) ,bad-cst <nil-call-stack> ,ttree)

; since then we can view the result as

; `(mvf ,mx-id ,<msg> ,bad-cst ,call-stack ,ttree)

; However, we would like to have a very fast test for whether the tuple
; returned designates an error.  The present approach allows us to test with
; stringp on the second value returned.  We take advantage of that in the
; definition of bdd-mv-let.

; Note that the order of the first two values should not be changed:  we
; declare mx-id to be a fixnum at some point, and we we want the second
; position to be tested by stringp to see if we have an "error" situation.

; Keep this in sync with bdd-mv-let.

  `(mvf ,mx-id ,fmt-string (cons ,fmt-alist ,bad-cst)

; The following nil is really an initial value of the bdd-call-stack that is
; ultimately to be placed in a bddnote.  At the time of this writing,
; bdd-mv-let is the only place where we update this stack.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; In this work we represent terms in what we call the cheap syntax.  Such a
; "term" is called a "csterm".  Bryant would call it a "node."

; We are interested in normalized IF expressions corresponding to ACL2 terms.
; If x is not itself an IF term, then (IF x y z) is represented by

; `(k ,x ,boolp ,y . ,z)

; where k is a natural number that is uniquely associated with <x,y,z> and
; boolp is t if the term is known to be Boolean.  The association between k and
; <x,y,z> is arranged via a "hash table" discussed below.  The objective is
; that two canonicalized IF expressions are equal (and therefore represent the
; same term) iff their unique identifiers (cars) are =.

; We also represent "leaf" ACL2 terms, which are generally IF-free, as csts of
; a slightly different sort; see below.  (Note that these may have IFs in them
; because certain function symbols are "blocked" -- see bdd-constructors.)

; The list of "leaf" csts arising from variables in the input term, which we
; typically call leaf-cst-list, is passed around unchanged by various of our
; functions.  We rely on the op-ht to find csts for other leaves, and to avoid
; re-consing up leaf csts.

; The shapes of csts are as follows.  Note that two csts are equal iff their
; cars are =.

; Non-leaf:
; (unique-id tst boolp tbr . fbr) ; informally, represents (if tst tbr fbr)

; Leaf:
; (unique-id term boolp)
; where term is of one of the following forms:
;   variable
;   quotep
;   application of function symbol other than IF to a list of csts

; WARNING:  The definition of leafp below relies on the fact that leaf csts are
; exactly those whose final cdr is nil.  Do not succumb to the temptation to
; add a new field as the final cdr without taking this into account.

; Note:  It is tempting to replace the "term" in the last case by an ACL2 term,
; rather than an application of a function symbol to a list of csts.  However,
; the list of csts has presumably already been consed up, so we save the
; re-consing, awaiting the final decoding to build the actual ACL2 term if
; necessary.

; Macros for accessing canonicalized IFs:

(defmacro unique-id (x) `(the-fixnum (car ,x)))

; cst-boolp, when we used to keep this information directly in leaf nodes only.

; We could just use the rewrite-rule data structures already existing in the
; ACL2 world.  However, we suspect that it is a good idea, in order to support
; computationally intensive bdd computations, to avoid having to look at the
; enabled structure or dig deep into a rewrite rule in order to find the
; various fields we need.  In fact, we want to have the lhs available as
; quickly as possible, since that field is used the most.

; This function returns lists of definitional and non-definitional bdd-rules
; corresponding to the lemmas of a given function symbol.  The arguments are as
; follows.

; recp:    True when the top-level function symbol for the lemmas is recursive
; lemmas:  The rewrite-rule structures that we want to convert to bdd-rules
; ens:     The current enabled structure
; all-fns: List of all function symbols already encountered in bdd rules built
; nondef-rules:  Bdd-rules accumulated so far not from definition rules
; def-rules:     Bdd-rules accumulated so far from definition rules
; new-fns: List of function symbols to be added to all-fns (an accumulator)

; At this point, we do not support backchaining:  that is, we assume that each
; rule has :hyps field of NIL.  We also do not allow free variables in the
; :rhs, and we require :lhs to be a function symbol call.  We also require a
; null loop-stopper (:heuristic-info for subclass 'backchain), rather than
; attempting to control looping during the bdd computation.  Perhaps some of
; these restrictions can be removed after some thought and additional
; implementation work.

; We require that the :rhs only contain function symbols that are known in the
; op-alist.  In order to enforce this requirement, we simply pass back two
; values:  a list of new function symbols to consider (i.e., ones not in
; all-fns that occur in :rhs fields) and the list of bdd-rules.

; As noted in a comment in bdd-rules-alist, the lists of lemmas returned by
; this function need to be reversed, because they have the oldest rules at the
; front.  That could easily be changed, though the natural way to do this would
; presumably render this function non-tail recursive.  At this point the issue
; seems sufficiently minor that we are satisfied to leave things this way.

; In order to check for slow code, you can execute the following from ACL2 built
; on GCL, inside raw Lisp.
;
; (compile-file "bdd.lisp" :c-file t)
;
; Then, search the file bdd.c for make_fixnum and number_ for slow stuff.  Note
; that you'll find a lot of these, but you only need to worry about them in the
; workhorse functions, and you don't need to worry about CMPmake_fixnum when it
; is used for an error or for a new mx-id.
;
; When you find one of these, search upward for `local entry' to see which
; function or macro you are in.  Don't worry, for example, about commutative-p,
; which is a database kind of function rather than a workhorse function.
;
; You'll see things like the following (from local entry to BDD).  The idea here
; is that we are boxing a fixnum and pushing it on a stack, but why?  LnkLI253
; appears to be a function call, which is found near the end of the file to
; correspond to leaf-cst-list-array.  If we're still not clear on what's going
; on, we can look up 273 as well.  When we do this, we find that we are probably
; in the part of the BDD code shown at the end, which is not a problem.
