(error "Feature sb-thread not supported on Lisps other than SBCL")

; We would like to use the semaphore notification objects supported in SBCL
; 1.0.54+, but version 1.0.54 has a heap exhaustion error that we wish to
; avoid.  As such, for now, we remain compatible with 1.0.53 and below.  While
; we can consider uncommenting the following feature push once SBCL's support
; for semaphore notification objects is stable, the following questions seem
; difficult to answer: How can we determine when that is the case, and how
; confident are we that Rager's implementation using semaphore notification
; objects is correct?  Rager determined that 1.0.54 was unstable by making all
; of the books with parallelism enabled (and experiencing the "heap exhausted"
; error in one of the ordinal books [at the moment of this writing, he does not
; recall which one]).  Thus, Rager's code has not been completely tested using
; semaphore notification objects.

; Section:  Enabling and Disabling Interrupts

; Without-interrupts and unwind-protect-disable-interrupts-during-cleanup were
; originally defined here, but have been moved to acl2-fns.lisp in order to
; support not only ACL2(p) but also ACL2(h).

;---------------------------------------------------------------------
; Section:  Threading Interface
;
; The threading interface is intended for system level programmers.  It is not
; intended for the ACL2 user.  When writing system-level multi-threaded code,
; we use implementation-independent interfaces.  If you need a function not
; covered in this interface, create the interface!

; Many of the functions in this interface (lockp, make-lock, and so on) are not
; used elsewhere, but are included here in case we find a use for them later.

; We take a conservative approach for implementations that do not support
; parallelism.  For example, if the programmer asks for a semaphore or lock in
; an unsupported Lisp, then nil is returned.

; We employ counting semaphores.  For details, including a discussion of
; ordering, see comments in the definition of function make-semaphore.

; Note: We use parts of the threading interface for our implementation of the
; parallelism primitives.

(defstruct (atomically-modifiable-counter
            (:constructor make-atomically-modifiable-counter-raw))

; SBCL has an atomic increment and decrement interface.  In all small tests,
; this interface works well.  However, when we use this interface to
; parallelize the waterfall of ACL2, it doesn't work.  The observable bug that
; we find is that our Fixnum number is decremented too much (so it becomes -1,
; which is a really large non-negative fixnum).  Rather than sort out the cause
; of this bug, we simply revert to using locks in SBCL.  However, we leave the
; code that implements the use of these atomic increments and decrements.  This
; achieves two things: (1) The code is there if we decide we want to use it
; again later (maybe after reading on the SBCL email lists that a bug with
; these atomic operations was fixed) and (2) We will have an on-going record of
; the code that causes us to observe this bug (note that ACL2  4.2 also
; contains the implementation that uses atomic operations).  Maybe someone will
; be able to tell us what we are doing wrong.

; Essay on Condition Variables

; A condition variable is a data structure that can be passed to corresponding
; "wait" and "signal" functions.  When a thread calls the wait function on a
; condition variable, c, the thread blocks until "receiving a signal" from the
; application of the signal function to c.  Only one signal is sent per call of
; the signal function; so, at most one thread will unblock.  (There is a third
; notion for condition variable, namely the broadcast function, which is like
; the signal function except that all threads blocking on the given condition
; variable will unblock.  But we do not support broadcast functions in this
; interface, in part because we use semaphores for CCL, and there's no way
; to broadcast when you're really using a semaphore.)

; The design of our parallelism library is simpler when using condition
; variables for the following reason: Since a worker must wait for two
; conditions before consuming work, it is better to use a condition variable
; and test those two conditions upon waking, rather than try and use two
; semaphores.

; Implementation Note: As of March 2007, our CCL implementation does not
; yield true condition variables.  A condition variable degrades to a
; semaphore, so if one thread first signals a condition variable, then that
; signal has been stored.  Then later (perhaps much later), when another thread
; waits for that signal, that thread will be able to proceed by decrementing
; the count.  As a result the later thread will "receive" the signal, even
; though that signal occurred in the past.  Fortunately, this isn't a
; contradiction of the semantics of condition variables, since with condition
; variables there is no specification of how far into the future the waiting
; thread will receive a signal from the signaling thread.

; Note: Condition variables should not be used to store state.  They are only a
; signaling mechanism, and any state update implied by receiving a condition
; variable's signal should be checked.  This usage is believed to be consistent
; with traditional condition variable semantics.

(defun make-condition-variable ()

; If CCL implements condition variables, we will want to change the CCL
; expansion and remove the implementation note above.

; Because implementing broadcast for condition variables in CCL is much more
; heavyweight than a simple semaphore, we keep it simple until we have a use
; case for a broadcast.  Such simple requirements are satisfied by using a
; semaphore.

; Parallelism blemish: when timeout is provided, the return value of t can be
; misleading.  This isn't a huge problem, because condition variables are only
; used for signaling, and so, assuming the programmer is following the
; discipline associated with using condition variables, any thread waiting on a
; condition variable should check the state of the program for the property it
; needs anyway.  And, if that property is not provided, the thread will just
; rewait on the condition variable.  So, the only real penalty should be a
; slight loss of performance.  Of course, this small penalty depends on the
; following the discipline of using condition variables correctly.  We may not
; wish to rely upon the programmer's ability to follow this discipline, so we
; leave it as a parallelism blemish.

(defun make-semaphore (&optional name)

; Make-semaphore, signal-semaphore, and semaphorep work together to implement
; counting semaphores for the threading interface.

; This function creates "counting semaphores", which are data structures that
; include a "count" field, which is a natural number.  A thread can "wait on" a
; counting semaphore, and it will block in the case that the semaphore's count
; is 0.  To "signal" such a semaphore means to increment that field and to
; notify a unique waiting thread (we will discuss a relaxation of this
; uniqueness shortly) that the semaphore's count has been incremented.  Then
; this thread, which is said to "receive" the signal, decrements the
; semaphore's count and is then unblocked.  This mechanism is typically much
; faster than busy waiting.

; In principle more than one waiting thread could be notified (though this
; seems rare in practice).  In this case, only one would be the receiving
; thread, i.e., the one that decrements the semaphore's count and is then
; unblocked.

; If semaphore usage seems to perform inefficiently, could this be due to
; ordering issues?  For example, even though CCL nearly always uses a FIFO
; for blocked threads, it does not guarantee so: no such promise is made by the
; CCL documentation or implementor.  Thus, we make absolutely no guarantees
; about ordering; for example, we do not guarantee that the longest-blocked
; thread for a given semaphore is the one that would receive a signal.
; However, we suspect that this will usually be the case for most
; implementations, so assuming such an ordering property is probably a
; reasonable heuristic.  We would be somewhat surprised to find significant
; performance problems in our own application to ACL2's parallelism primitives
; due to the ordering provided by the underlying system.

; CCL provides us with semaphores for signaling.  SBCL provides condition
; variables for signaling.  Since we want to code for one type of signaling
; between parents and children, we create a semaphore wrapper for SBCL's
; condition variables.  The structure sbcl-semaphore implements the data for
; this wrapper.

; Followup: SBCL has recently (as of November 2010) implemented semaphores, and
; the parallelism code could be changed to reflect this.  However, since SBCL
; does not implement semaphore-notification-object's, we choose to stick with our
; own implementation of semaphores for now.

; This function is guaranteed to return t when there is no timeout provided and

; notification object as a means for determining whether a signal was actually
; received.

; Parallelism blemish: if a timeout is included, then it is our intent that a
; call of this function that times-out should return nil.  This is known to be
; the case in CCL, but while we have written the code for SBCL and LispWorks,
; we have not actually tested the code for this property.

; This function only returns normally after receiving a signal for the given
; semaphore, setting the notification status of notification (if supplied and
; non-nil) to true; see semaphore-notification-status.  But control can leave
; this function abnormally, for example if the thread executing a call of this
; function is interrupted (e.g., with interface function interrupt-thread) with
; code that does a throw, in which case notification is unmodified.

; We need the ability to know whether we received a signal or not.  CCL
; provides this through a semaphore notification object.  SBCL does not provide
; this mechanism currently, so we might "unreceive the signal" in the cleanup
; form of the implementation.  We do this by only decrementing the count of the
; semaphore iff we set the notification object.  This means we have to resignal
; the semaphore if we were interrupted while signaling, but we would have to do

; semaphore and for the signal from the CV
; -- Then thread C signals the CV

; -- The signal is effectively "lost", so while the semaphore count may
; be accurate, Thread B is still waiting on a signal that will never

; We guard against this lost signal by always re-signaling the condition
; variable (unless we're sure we received the signal, which we would know
; because "received-signal" would be set to t).

; This signaling during the unwind portion of the unwind protect definitely
; results in some inefficient execution.  This is brought about because now any
