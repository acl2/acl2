; Essay on Wormholes

; Once upon a time (Version  3.6 and earlier) the wormhole function had a
; pseudo-flg argument which allowed the user a quick way to determine whether
; it was appropriate to incur the expense of going into the wormhole.  The idea
; was that the form could have one a free var in it, wormhole-output, and that
; when it was evaluated in raw Lisp that variable was bound to the last value
; returned by the wormhole.  Since wormhole always returned nil anyway, this
; screwy semantics didn't matter.  However, it was implemented in such a way
; that a poorly constructed pseudo-flg could survive guard verification and yet
; cause a hard error at runtime because during guard verification
; wormhole-output was bound to NIL but in actual evaluation it was entirely
; under the control of the wormhole forms.

; To fix this we have introduced wormhole-eval.  It takes two important
; arguments, the name of the wormhole and a lambda expression.  Both must be
; quoted.  The lambda may have at most one argument but the body may contain
; any variables available in the environment of the wormhole-eval call.  (A
; third argument to wormhole-eval is an arbitrary form that uses all the free
; vars of the lambda, thus insuring that translate will cause an error if the
; lambda uses variables unavailable in the context.)  The body of the lambda
; must be a single-valued, non-state, non-stobj term.

; The idea is that the lambda expression is applied to the last value of the
; wormhole output and its value is assigned as the last value of the wormhole
; output.  Wormhole-eval always returns nil.  Translation of a wormhole-eval
; call enforces these restrictions.  Furthermore, it translates the body of the
; lambda (even though the lambda is quoted).  This is irrelevant since the
; wormhole-eval returns nil regardless of the lambda expression supplied.
; Similarly, translation computes an appropriate third argument to use all the
; free vars, so the user may just write nil there and a suitable form is
; inserted by translate.

; We arrange for wormhole-eval to be a macro in raw lisp that really does what
; is said above.

; To make it bullet-proof, when we generate guard clauses we go inside the
; lambda, generating a new variable symbol to use in place of the lambda formal
; denoting the last value of the wormhole output.  Thus, if guard clauses can be
; verified, it doesn't matter what the wormhole actually returns as its value.

; Ev-rec, the interpreter for terms, treats wormhole-eval specially in the
; expected way, as does oneify.  Thus, both interpreted and compiled calls of
; wormhole-eval are handled, and guard violations are handled politely.

; Now, how does this allow us to fix the wormhole pseudo-flg problem?

; The hidden global variable in Lisp used to record the status of the various
; wormholes is called *wormhole-status-alist*.  The entry in this alist for
; a particular wormhole will be called the wormhole's ``status.''  The lambda
; expression in wormhole-eval maps the wormhole's status to a new status.

; The status of a wormhole is supposed to be a cons whose car is either :ENTER
; or :SKIP.  However, in the absence of verifying the guards on the code inside
; wormholes and in light of the fact that users can set the status by
; manipulating wormhole-status in the wormhole it is hard to insure that the
; status is always as supposed.  So we code rather defensively.

; When the ``function'' wormhole is called it may or may not actually enter a
; wormhole.  ``Entering'' the wormhole means invoking the form on the given
; input, inside a side-effects undoing call of ld.  That, in turn, involves
; setting up the ld specials and then reading, translating, and evaluating
; forms.  Upon exit, cleanup must be done.  So entering is expensive.

; Whether it enters the wormhole or not depends on the wormhole's status, and
; in particular it depends on what we call the wormhole's ``entry code''
; computed from the status as follows.

; If the wormhole's status satisfies wormhole-statusp then the situation is
; simple: wormhole enters the wormhole if the status is :ENTER and doesn't if
; the status is :SKIP.  But we compute the entry code defensively: the entry
; code is :SKIP if and only if the wormhole's status is a cons whose car is
; :SKIP.  Otherwise, the entry code is :ENTER.

; If we enter the wormhole, we take the wormhole input argument and stuff it
; into (@ wormhole-input), allowing the user to see it inside the ld code.  We
; take the wormhole status and stuff it into (@ wormhole-status), allowing the
; user to see it and probably change it with (assign wormhole-status...).  When
; we exit ld, we take (@ wormhole-status) and put it back into the hidden
; *wormhole-status-alist*.

; One subtlety arises: How to make wormholes re-entrant...  The problem is that
; sometimes the current status is in the hidden alist and other times it is in
; (@ wormhole-status).  So when we try to enter a new wormhole from within a
; wormhole -- which always happens by calling wormhole-eval -- the first thing
; we do is stuff the current (@ wormhole-status) into the hidden
; *wormhole-status-alist*.  This means that the lambda expression for the new
; entrance is applied, it is applied to the ``most recent'' value of the status
; of that particular wormhole.  The natural undoing of wormhole effects
; implements the restoration of (@ wormhole-status) upon exit from the
; recursive wormhole.

; If we wanted to convert our system code to logic mode we would want to verify
; the guards of the lambda bodies and the wormhole-status after ld.  See the
; comment in push-accp.  Here is a proposal for how to do that.  First, insist
; that wormhole names are symbols.  Indeed, they must be one argument,
; guard-verified Boolean functions.  The guard for a call of wormhole-eval on a
; wormhole named foo should include the conjunct (foo nil) to insure that the
; initial value of the status is acceptable.  The guard on the body of (lambda
; (whs) body) should be extended to include the hypothesis that (foo whs) is
; true and that (foo whs) --> (foo body) is true.  We should then change
; wormhole so that if it calls ld it tests foo at runtime after the ld returns
; so we know that the final status satisfies foo.  If we do this we can safely
; assume that every status seen by a lambda body in wormhole-eval will satisfy
; the foo invariant.

; variable names supplied by translate.  Finally, we know that whs appears as
; the lambda formal iff it is used in body.

; Wormholes may have arbitrary objects for names, so qname is not necessarily a

; Historical Note

; This package restriction prohibits using some very common names as
; variables or constants, e.g., MAX and REST.  Why do we do this?  The
; reason is that there are a few such symbols, such as
; LAMBDA-LIST-KEYWORDS, which if bound or set could cause real
; trouble.  Rather than attempt to identify all of the specials of
; CLTL that are prohibited as ACL2 variables, we just prohibit them
; all.  One might be reminded of Alexander cutting the Gordian Knot.
; We could spend a lot of time unraveling complex questions about
; specials in CLTL or we can get on with it.  When ACL2 prevents you
; from using REST as an argument, you should see the severed end of a
; once tangled rope.

; For example, akcl and lucid (and others perhaps) allow you to define
; (defun foo (boole-c2) boole-c2) but then (foo 3) causes an error.
; Note that boole-c2 is recognized as special (by
; system::proclaimed-special-p) in lucid, but not in akcl (by
; si::specialp); in fact it's a constant in both.  Ugh.

; - It will be necessary to update :doc defconst.

; - Fix the error message for, e.g., (defconst foo::* 17), so that it doesn't

; - Make sure the error message is correct for (defun foo (*) *).  It should

; Essay on Evisceration

; We have designed the pretty printer so that it can print an
; "eviscerated" object, that is, an object that has had certain
; substructures removed.  We discuss the prettyprinter in the Essay on
; the ACL2 Prettyprinter.  The pretty printer has a flag, eviscp,
; which indicates whether the object has been eviscerated or not.  If
; not, then the full object is printed as it stands.  If so, then
; certain substructures of it are given special interpretation by the
; printer.  In particular, when the printer encounters a cons of the
; form (:evisceration-mark . x) then x is a string and the cons is
; printed by printing the characters in x (without the double
; gritches).

;     object                            pretty printed output
; (:evisceration-mark . "#")                     #
; (:evisceration-mark . "...")                   ...
; (:evisceration-mark . "<state>")               <state>
; (:evisceration-mark . ":EVISCERATION-MARK")    :EVISCERATION-MARK

; So suppose you have some object and you want to print it, implementing
; the CLTL conventions for *print-level* and *print-length*.  Then you
; must first scan it, inserting :evisceration-mark forms where
; appropriate.  But what if it contains some occurrences of
; :evisceration-mark?  Then you must use evisceration mechanism to print
; them correctly!  Once you have properly eviscerated the object, you can
; call the prettyprinter on it, telling it that the object has been
; eviscerated.  If, on the other hand, you don't want to eviscerate it,
; then you needn't sweep it to protect the native :evisceration-marks:
; just call the prettyprinter with the eviscp flag off.

(defconst *evisceration-mark* :evisceration-mark)

; Note: It is important that the evisceration-mark be a keyword.
; One reason is that (:evisceration-mark . ":EVISCERATION-MARK")
; couldn't be used to print a non-keyword because the package might
; need to be printed.  Another is that we exploit the fact that no
; event name nor any formal is *evisceration-mark*.  See
; print-ldd-full-or-sketch.  Furthermore, if the particular keyword
; chosen is changed, alter *anti-evisceration-mark* below!

; Essay on Iprinting

; Through Version_3.4, when ACL2 eviscerated a form using a print-level or
; print-length from an evisc-tuple, the resulting # and ... made it impossible
; to read the form back in.  We have implemented "iprinting" (think
; "interactive printing") to deal with this problem.  Our implementation uses
; an "iprint array", or "iprint-ar" for short, as described below.  Now, when
; iprinting is enabled, then instead of # or ... we will see #@i# for i = 1, 2,
; etc.  See :doc set-iprint for more information at the user level.  In brief,
; the idea is to maintain a state global 'iprint-ar whose value is an ACL2
; array that associates each such i with its hidden value.  (This use of #@i#
; allows us also to think of "iprinting" as standing for "index printing" or "i
; printing".)

; We implement this idea by modifying the recursive subroutines of eviscerate
; to accumulate each association of a positive i with its hidden value. When
; fmt (or fms, etc.) is called, eviscerate-top or eviscerate-stobjs-top will be
; called in order to update the existing 'iprint-ar with those new
; associations.

; We use index 0 to store the most recent i for which #@i# has been printed,
; assuming iprinting is enabled, or else (list i) if iprinting is disabled.  We
; call such i the last-index, and it is initially 0.  Note that state global
; 'iprint-ar is thus always bound to an installed ACL2 array.

; When state global 'iprint-fal has a non-nil value (which is exactly when
; set-iprint was last called with a non-nil value of :share), it is a
; fast-alist that inverts iprint-ar in the following sense: for every pair (i
; . v) in iprint-ar with 1 <= i <= last-index, (v . i) is in the value of
; 'iprint-fal.  See :doc set-iprint for more about :share.

; We have to face a fundamental question: Do we use acons or aset1 as we
; encounter a new form to assign to some #@i# during those recursive
; subroutines?  The latter is dangerous in case we interrupt before installing
; the result in the state global.  So it's tempting to use acons -- but it
; could be inefficient to compress the iprint-ar on each top-level call.  So
; instead we use acons to build up a new alist from scratch.  Then at the
; top level, we apply aset1 for each entry if we can do so without needing to
; ``rollover'', i.e., set the last-index back to 0; otherwise we call compress1
; rather than making a series of aset1 calls.  With luck this final step will
; be fast and unlikely to be interrupted from the time the first aset1 or
; compress1 is applied until the state global 'iprint-ar is updated.

; Let's also comment on why we have a soft and a hard bound (as described in
; :doc set-iprint).  In general we allow indices to increase between successive
; top-level invocations, so that the user can read back in any forms that were
; printed. But the soft bound forces a rollover at the top level of LD when the
; last-index exceeds that bound, so that we don't hold on to a potentially
; unbounded amount of space for the objects in the iprint-ar. The hard bound
; (which generally exceeds the soft bound) steps in if the last-index exceeds
; it after pretty-printing a single form.  Thus, if there are large objects and
; very long runs between successive top-level forms, space can be
; reclaimed. The hard bound is therefore probably less likely to be of use.

; We maintain the invariant that the dimension of state global 'iprint-ar
; exceeds the hard bound.  Thus, when we update the 'iprint-ar in the normal
; case that the hard bound is not exceeded, then the dimension will not be
; exceeded either; that is, every update will be with an index that is in
; bounds.  In order to maintain this invariant, the hard bound is untouchable,
; and its setter function compresses the global iprint-ar with a new dimension
; that exceeds the specified hard bound.  Therefore the hard bound must be a
; number, not nil.  Notice that with this invariant, we can avoid compressing
; twice when we roll over upon exceeding the hard or soft bound: we first reset
; the last-index to 0 and then do the compression, rather than compressing once
; for the increased dimension and once for the rollover.

; We also maintain the invariant that the maximum-length of the 'iprint-ar is
; always at least four times its dimension.  See the comment about this in
; rollover-iprint-ar.

; It is tempting to cause an error when the user submits a form containing some
; #@j# and #@k# such that j <= last-index < k.  In such a case, k is from
; before the rollover and j is from after the rollover, so these couldn't have
; been stored during a prettyprint of the same form.  By default we avoid this
; restriction, because the user might want to read a list that includes some
; forms prettyprinted before the last rollover and other forms printed after
; the last rollover.  But if iprint sharing is on, then a subform that had been
; printed before rollover might include iprint indices that have since changed,
; which might be highly confusing.  So we make the above restriction on indices
; when iprint sharing is on, as documented in :doc set-iprint.

; We need to be sure that the global iprint-ar is installed as an ACL2 array, in
; order to avoid slow-array-warnings.  See the comment in
; push-wormhole-undo-formi for how we deal with this issue in the presence of
; wormholes.

; See also eviscerate-top, which takes iprint-ar from the state and installs a
; new iprint-ar in the state, and update-iprint-alist, which describes the role
; of a non-symbol iprint-alist as per the Essay on Iprinting.

; Print-level and print-length should either be non-negative integers or nil.
; Alist and evisc-table are alists pairing arbitrary objects to strings or
; other objects.  Hiding-cars is a list of symbols.  Any x that starts with one
; of these symbols is printed as <hidden>.  If alist or evisc-table pairs an
; object with a string, the string is printed in place of the object.  If alist
; or evisc-table pairs an object with anything else, x, then x is substituted
; for the the object and is treated as eviscerated.  In general, alist will
; come from an evisceration tuple and evisc-table will be the value of the
; 'evisc-table table in the current ACL2 world.  We give priority to the former
; because the user may want to override the evisc-table, for example using ~P
; in a call of fmt.

; This function copies the structure x and replaces certain deep substructures
; with evisceration marks.  The determination of which substructures to so
; abbreviate is based on the same algorithm used to define *print-level* and
; *print-length* in CLTL, with the additional identification of all occurrences
; of any object in alist or evisc-table.

; For example, if x is '(if (member x y) (+ (car x) 3) '(foo . b)) and
; print-level is 2 and print-length is 3 then the output is:

; (IF (MEMBER X Y)
;     (+ (*evisceration-mark* . "#") 3)
;     (*evisceration-mark* . "..."))

; See pg 373 of CLTL.

; Of course we are supposed to print this as:

; (IF (MEMBER X Y) (+ # 3) ...)

; We consider a couple of special cases to reduce unnecessary consing
; of eviscerated values.

; Essay on the ACL2 Prettyprinter

; The ACL2 prettyprinter is a two pass, linear time, exact prettyprinter.  By
; "exact" we mean that if it has a page of width w and a big enough form, it
; will guarantee to use all the columns, i.e., the widest line will end in
; column w.  The algorithm dates from about 1971 -- virtually the same code was
; in the earliest Edinburgh Pure Lisp Theorem Prover.  This approach to
; prettyprinting was invented by Bob Boyer; see
; http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~boyer/pretty-print.pdf.  Most prettyprinters are
; quadratic and inexact.

; The secret to this method is to make two linear passes, ppr1 and ppr2.  The
; first pass builds a data structure, called a ``ppr tuple,'' that tells the
; second pass how to print.

; Some additional general principles of our prettyprinter are
; (i)    Print flat whenever possible.

; (ii)   However, don't print flat argument lists of length over 40; they're
;        too hard to parse.  (But this can be overridden by state global
;        ppr-flat-right-margin.)

; (iii)  Atoms and eviscerated things (which print like atoms, e.g., `<world>')
;        may be printed on a single line.

; (iv)   But parenthesized expressions should not be printed on a line with any
;        other argument (unless the whole form fits on the line).  Thus we may
;        produce:
;        `(foo (bar a) b c d)'
;        and
;        `(foo a b
;              c d)'
;        But we never produce
;        `(foo (bar a) b
;              c d)'
;        preferring instead
;        `(foo (bar a)
;              b c d)'
;        It is our belief that parenthesized expressions are hard to parse and
;        after doing so the eye tends to miss little atoms (like b above)
;        hiding in their shadows.

; To play with ppr we recommend executing this form:

; (ppr2 (ppr1 x (print-base) (print-radix) 30 0 state t)
;       0 *standard-co* state t)

; This will prettyprint x on a page of width 30, assuming that printing starts
; in column 0.  To see the ppr tuple that drives the printer, just evaluate the
; inner ppr1 form,
; (ppr1 x (print-base) (print-radix) 30 0 state nil).

; The following test macro is handy.  A typical call of the macro is

; (test 15 (foo (bar x) (mum :key1 val1 :key2 :val2)))

; Note that x is not evaluated.  If you want to evaluate x and ppr the value,
; use

;   (testfn 10
;           (eviscerate-simple `(foo (bar x)
;                             (mum :key1 :val1 :key2 :val2)
;                             ',(w state))
;                       nil nil ; print-level and print-length
;                       (world-evisceration-alist state nil)
;                       nil
;                       nil)
;           state)

; Note that x may be eviscerated, i.e., eviscerated objects in x are printed in
; their short form, not literally.

;   (defun testfn (d x state)
;     (declare (xargs :mode :program :stobjs (state)))
;     (let ((tuple (ppr1 x (print-base) (print-radix) d 0 state t)))

; Ppr tuples record enough information about the widths of various forms so
; that it can be computed without having to recompute any part of it and so
; that the second pass can print without having to count characters.

; A ppr tuple has the form (token n . z).  In the display below, the variables
; ti represent ppr tuples and the variables xi represent objects to be printed
; directly.  Any xi could an eviscerated object, a list whose car is the
; evisceration mark.

; (FLAT n x1 ... xk) - Print the xi, separated by spaces, all on one
;                      line. The total width of output will be n.
;                      Note that k >= 1.  Note also that such a FLAT
;                      represents k objects.  A special case is (FLAT
;                      n x1), which represents one object.  We make
;                      this observation because sometimes (in
;                      cons-ppr1) we `just know' that k=1 and the
;                      reason is: we know the FLAT we're holding
;                      represents a single object.

; (FLAT n x1... . xk)- Print the xi, separated by spaces, with xk
;                      separated by `. ', all on one line.  Here xk
;                      is at atom or an eviscerated object.

; (FLAT n . xk)      - Here, xk is an atom (or an eviscerated object).
;                      Print a dot, a space, and xk.  The width will
;                      be n.  Note that this FLAT does not actually
;                      represent an object.  That is, no Lisp object
;                      prints as `. xk'.

; Note: All three forms of FLAT are really just (FLAT n . x) where x is a
; possibly improper list and the elements of x (and its final cdr) are printed,
; separated appropriately by spaces or dot.

; (MATCHED-KEYWORD n x1)
;                    - Exactly like (FLAT n x1), i.e., prints x1,
;                      but by virtue of being different from FLAT
;                      no other xi's are ever added.  In this tuple,
;                      x1 is always a keyword and it will appear on
;                      a line by itself.  Its associated value will
;                      appear below it in the column because we tried
;                      to put them on the same line but we did not have
;                      room.

; (DOT 1)            - Print a dot.

; (QUOTE n . t1)     - Print a single-quote followed by pretty-
;                      printing the ppr tuple t1.

; (WIDE n t1 t2 ...) - Here, t1 is a FLAT tuple of width j.  We
;                      print an open paren, the contents of t1, a
;                      space, and then we prettyprint each of the
;                      remaining ti in a column.  When we're done, we
;                      print a close paren.  The width of the longest
;                      line we will print is n.

; (i n t1 ...)       - We print an open paren, prettyprint t1, then
;                      do a newline.  Then we prettyprint the
;                      remaining ti in the column that is i to the
;                      right of the paren.  We conclude with a close
;                      paren.  The width of the longest line we will
;                      print is n.  We call this an `indent tuple'.

; (KEYPAIR n t1 . t2)- Here, t1 is a FLAT tuple of width j.  We print
;                      t1, a space, and then prettyprint t2.  The
;                      length of the longest line we will print is n.

; The sentences "The length of the longest line we will print is n."
; bears explanation.  Consider

; (FOO (BAR X)
;      (MUMBLE Y)
;      Z)
;|<- 15 chars  ->|
; 123456789012345

; The length of the longest line, n, is 15.  That is, the length of the longest
; line counts the spaces from the start of the printing.  In the case of a
; KEYPAIR tuple:

; :KEY (FOO
;       (BAR X)
;       Y)
;|<- 13      ->|

; we count the spaces from the beginning of the keyword.  That is, we consider
; the whole block of text.

; Below we print test-term in two different widths, and display the ppr tuple
; that drives each of the two printings.

;         '(FFF (GGG (HHH (QUOTE (A . B))))

; The function cons-ppr1, below, is the first interesting function in the nest.
; We want to build a tuple to print a given list form, like a function call.
; We basically get the tuple for the car and a list of tuples for the cdr and
; then use cons-ppr1 to combine them.  The resulting list of tuples will be
; embedded in either a WIDE or an indent tuple.  Thus, this list of tuples we
; will create describes a column of forms.  The number of items in that column
; is not necessarily the same as the number of arguments of the function call.
; For example, the term (f a b c) might be prettyprinted as
; (f a
;    b c)
; where b and c are printed flat on a single line.  Thus, the three arguments
; of f end up being described by a list of two tuples, one for a and another
; for b and c.

; To form lists of tuples we just use cons-ppr1 to combine the tuples we get
; for each element.

; Let x and lst be, respectively, a ppr tuple for an element and a list of
; tuples for list of elements.  Think of lst as describing a column of forms.
; Either x can become another item that column, or else x can be incorporated
; into the first item in that column.  For example, suppose x will print as X
; and lst will print as a column containing y1, y2, etc.  Then we have this
; choice for printing x and lst:

; lengthened column          lengthened first row
; x                          x y1
; y1                         y2
; ...                        ...

; We get the `lengthened column' behavior if we just cons x onto lst.  We get
; the `lengthened row' behavior if we merge the tuples for x and y1.  But we
; only merge if they both print flat.

; Now we lay down some macros that help with the efficiency of the FMT
; functions, by making it easy to declare various formals and function values
; to be fixnums.  See the Essay on Fixnum Declarations.

; represent the dot so that its placement is first class.  So when we're
; assembling the tuple for a list, we cdr down the list using cons-ppr1 to put
; together the tuple for the car with the tuple for the cdr.  If we reach a
; non-nil cdr, atm, we call cons-ppr1 on the dot tuple and the tuple
; representing the atm.  Depending on the width we have, this may produce (FLAT
; n . atm) which attaches the dot to the atm, or ((DOT 1) (FLAT n atm)) which
; leaves the dot on a line by itself.

; We want keywords to appear on new lines.  That means if the first element of
; lst is a keyword, don't merge (unless x is one too).

; it is on the left margin.  We are supposed to print our first character in

; Through Version_3.4, ACL2 could hyphenate rule names during proof commentary
; because of the following COND branch in the case of ~x/~y/~X/~Y (though
; fmt-symbol-name has since been renamed as fmt-tilde-s).  We have decided to
; opt instead for uniform treatment of ~x/~y/~X/~Y and ~p/~q/~P/~Q, modulo
; potential support for infix printing for the latter group (which we may
; eliminate in the future).  By avoiding hyphenation we make it easier for a
; user to grab a rule name from the output, though now one might want to do
; some hyphenation by hand when preparing proof output for publication.

; This function returns an object that when bound to #\0 will cause

; strings in lst, followed by punctuation punct, which must be #\. or
; #\,.

; WARNING:  This displayed strings are not equal to the strings in lst
; because whitespace may be inserted!

; ~& doesn't print a list of short strings very well because the first
; group is printed flat across the line, then when the line gets too
; long, the next string is indented and followed by a newline, which
; allows another bunch to be printed flat.  This function prints them
; with ~s which actually breaks the strings up internally in a way
; that does not preserve their equality.  "history-management.lisp"
; might have a newline inserted after the hyphen.

; The ACL2 Record Facilities

; Our record facility gives us the ability to declare "new" types of
; structures which are represented as lists.  If desired the lists
; are tagged with the name of the new record type.  Otherwise they are
; not tagged and are called "cheap" records.

; The expression (DEFREC SHIP (X . Y) NIL) declares SHIP to
; be a tagged (non-cheap) record of two components X and Y.  An
; example concrete SHIP is '(SHIP 2 . 4).  Note that cheapness refers
; only to whether the record is tagged and whether the tag is tested
; upon access and change, not whether the final cdr is used.

; To make a ship:  (MAKE SHIP :X x :Y y) or (MAKE SHIP :Y y :X x).
; To access the Xth component of the ship object obj: (ACCESS SHIP obj :X).
; To change the Xth component to val: (CHANGE SHIP obj :X val).
; Note the use of keywords in these forms.

; It is possible to change several fields at once, e.g.,
; (CHANGE SHIP obj :X val-x :Y val-y).  In general, to cons up a changed
; record one only does the conses necessary.

; The implementation of records is as follows.  DEFREC expands
; into a collection of macro definitions for certain generated function
; symbols.  In the example above we define the macros:

; |Make SHIP record|
; |Access SHIP record field X|
; |Access SHIP record field Y|
; |Change SHIP record fields|

; The macro expression (MAKE SHIP ...) expands to a call of the first
; function.  (ACCESS SHIP ... :X) expands to a call of the second.
; (CHANGE SHIP obj :X val-x :Y val-y) expands to
; (|Change SHIP record fields| obj :X val-x :Y val-y).

; The five new symbols above are defined as macros that further expand
; into raw CAR/CDR nests if the record is cheap and a similar nest
; that first checks the type of the record otherwise.

; In using the record facility I have sometimes pondered which fields I should
; allocate where to maximize access speed.  Other times I have just laid them
; out in an arbitrary fashion.  In any case, the following functions might be
; useful if you are wondering how to lay out a record.  That is, grab the
; following progn and execute it in the full ACL2 system.  (It cannot be
; executed at this point in basis.lisp because it uses functions defined
; elsewhere; it is here only to be easy to find when looking up the comments
; about records.)  Note that it changes the default-defun-mode to :program.  Then
; invoke :sbt n, where n is an integer.

; For example
; ACL2 g>:sbt 5

; The Binary Trees with Five Tips
; 2.400  ((2 . 2) 2 3 . 3)
; 2.600  (1 (3 . 3) 3 . 3)
; 2.800  (1 2 3 4 . 4)

; Sbt will print out all of the interesting binary trees with the
; given number of tips.  The integer appearing at a tip is the number
; of car/cdrs necessary to access that field of a cheap record laid
; out as shown.  That is also the number of conses required to change
; that single field.  The decimal number in the left column is the
; average number of car/cdrs required to access a field, assuming all
; fields are accessed equally often.  The number of trees generated
; grows exponentially with n.  Roughly 100 trees are printed for size
; 10.  Beware!

; The function (analyze-tree x state) is also helpful.  E.g.,

; ACL2 g>(analyze-tree '((type-alist . term) cl-ids rewrittenp
;                          force-flg . rune-or-non-rune)

; Warning and Observation

; Essay on Inhibited Output and the Illusion of Windows

; The "io" in io?, below, stands for "inhibit output".  Roughly speaking, it
; takes an unevaluated symbolic token denoting a "kind" of output, an output
; shape involving STATE, and a form with the indicated output signature.
; If the "kind" of output is currently inhibited, it returns all nils and the
; current state, e.g., (mv nil state nil) in the case where the output
; shape is something like (mv x state y).  If the kind of output is not
; inhibited, the form is evaluated and its value is returned.

; If form always returned an error triple, this could be said as:
; `(cond ((member-eq ',token (f-get-global 'inhibit-output-lst state))
;         (value nil))
;        (t ,form))
; This whole macro is just a simple way to do optionally inhibited output.

; The introduction of an emacs window-based interface, led us to put a little
; more functionality into this macro.  Each kind of output has a window
; associated with it.  If the kind of output is uninhibited, the io? macro
; sends to *standard-co* certain auxiliary output which causes the
; *standard-co* output by form to be shipped to the designated window.

; The association of windows is accomplished via the constant
; *window-descriptions* below which contains elements of the form (token str
; clear cursor-at-top pop-up), where token is a "kind" of output, str
; identifies the associated window, and the remaining components specify
; options for how output to the window is handled by default.  The io? macro
; provides keyword arguments for overriding these defaults.  If :clear t is
; specified, the window is cleared before the text is written into it,
; otherwise the text is appended to the end.  If :cursor-at-top t is specified,
; the cursor is left at the top of the inserted text, otherwise it is left at
; the bottom of the inserted text.  If :pop-up t is specified, the window is
; raised to the top of the desktop, otherwise the window remains where it was.

; We have purposely avoided trying to suggest that windows are objects in ACL2.
; We have no way to create them or manage them.  We merely ship a sequence of
; characters to *standard-co* and let the host do whatever it does with them.
; Extending ACL2 with some window abstraction is a desirable thing to do.  I
; would like to be able to manipulate windows as ACL2 objects.  But that is
; beyond the scope of the current work whose aim is merely to provide a more
; modern interface to ACL2 without doing too much violence to ACL2's
; applicative nature or to its claim to be Common Lisp.  Those two constraints
; make the introduction of true window objects truly interesting.

; Finally io? allows for the entire io process to be illusory.  This occurs if
; the commentp argument is t.  In this case, the io? form is logically
; equivalent to NIL.  The actual output is performed after opening a wormhole
; to state.

; Typical use (io? error nil (mv col state) (x y) (fmt ...)), meaning execute
; the fmt statement unless 'error is on 'inhibit-output-lst.  The mv expression
; is the shape of the output produced by the fmt expression, and the list (x y)
; for vars indicates the variables other than state that occur free in that
; expression.  See the comment above, and see the Essay on Saved-output for a
; comment that gives a convenient macro for obtaining the free variables other
; than state that occur free in body.

; Default-bindings is a list of doublets (symbol value).  It is used in order
; to supply a non-nil return value for other than state when io is suppressed.
; For example, fmt returns col and state, as suggested by the third (shape)
; argument below.  Without the :default-bindings, this form would evaluate to
; (mv nil state) if event IO is inhibited.  But there are fixnum declarations
; that require the first return value of fmt to be an integer, and we can
; specify the result in the inhibited case to be (mv 0 state) with the
; following :default-bindings:

; (io? event nil (mv col state) nil (fmt ...) :default-bindings ((col 0)))

; The values in :default-bindings are evaluated, so it would be equivalent to
; replace 0 with (- 4 4), for example.

; Keep argument list in sync with io?@par.

; Chk-translatable is only used when commentp is not nil, to check at translate
; time that the body passes translation relative to the given shape.
; (Otherwise such a check is only made when the wormhole call below is actually
; evaluated.)

; Parallelism blemish: avoid calling io? with commentp = t under
; with-output-lock.  During experimentation, we have ACL2(p) hang in such a
; case, because of the interaction of locks created by wormhole1 and
; with-output-lock.  (So more generally, avoid calling with-wormhole-lock in
; the scope of with-output-lock; the other way around is fine.)

; ``Invariant'' on the Wormhole-Data field of the COMMENT-WINDOW-IO wormhole:

; We'd like to know that the wormhole-data field of the wormhole named
; comment-window-io is an alist and that any key in that alist that is
; string-equal to a member of *tracked-warning-summaries* is bound to a
; true-listp.  We can't actually guarantee that invariant since there is
; nothing to stop the user from invoking wormhole on that name.  We can't just
; prevent the translation of (wormhole 'comment-window-io ...) after boot-strap
; because many books use this macro to lay down such a form.  So instead of
; guaranteeing the invariant we merely check that the data field has the right
; shape when we need it.  The consequence of running this code after the user
; has violated the invariant is merely that some tracked warnings might be
; printed multiple times during a proof.

; Preventing Duplicate Warnings: When the comment window is being used for
; warnings, we assume the supplied input (i.e., the values of the expressions
; in `vars' here which will become the wormhole-input when we manufacture the
; actual wormhole) is exactly as laid down in the macro warning1-form.  We
; check that assumption below as we generate the entry lambda for the wormhole.
; Given that check, the entry lambda below can refer to summary, ctx, alist,
; and str which are, respectively, warning's ``label,'' the context, the fmt
; alist and the fmt string.  Note that the summary here is a string, e.g.,
; "Use" or "use" or "rewrite-lambda-object" and is colloquially called the
; warning's ``label'' or ``kind'' in the documentation.  Let's call ctx, alist,
; and str, collectively as (list ctx alist str), the ``explanation'' of the
; warning.  When the comment window is being used for warnings and the summary
; is string-equal to a member of *tracked-warning-summaries* we keep track of
; the explanations already printed for that summary.  If a warning to be
; printed has a tracked summary and its explanation is already on the alist
; paired with that summary in the wormhole-data we do not print the
; explanation.  We clear the data (of tracked summaries only) in print-summary.
; We spot check that the data field has the right shape according to our
; ``invariant'' above: if the summary is to be tracked, we check that the
; wormhole-data is an alist and that this particular summary string is bound to
; a true-list (so we can do a member-equal check on it).  If these
; ``invariants'' don't hold, we proceed as though the warning isn't to be
; tracked, i.e., we might print the same warning multiple times.

; Here is the entry lambda for warnings:

; table, the "backbone" of the stobj is omitted, avoiding one level of
; indirection: in other words, the stobj *is* its field.  However, in the case
; of an array whose type specifies elements that are characters, that array may
; be a string (depending on the host Lisp and exactly how the type is
; specified), which is problematic since the utility live-stobjp depends on
; live stobjs not being strings.  See community book
; books/system/tests/stobj-issues.lisp.  Here, we check whether we can safely
; give the special "single-field" treatment of avoiding the "backbone", based
; on the type of the single field, returning t only if that is indeed safe.

; For the case of a stobj field, we considered causing an error here since the
; raw Lisp code for stobj-let avoids calling updaters because there is no need:
; updates for fields that are stobjs have already updated destructively.
; However, a raw Lisp updater can be called by a *1* function, say *1*f,
; applied to live stobjs, when guard checking does not pass control to the raw
; Lisp function, f.  Perhaps we could optimize to avoid this, but there is no
; need; this setf is fast and is only called on behalf of executing *1*
; function calls.  See the comment referencing "defstobj-field-fns-raw-defs" in

; variable.  At that time we thought that one might wonder why we didn't choose
; to name this object $s.  Below we explain our earlier thinking.  Now that we
; use only (the-live-var name) only to store properties, perhaps we could
; instead store those properties on name; but when we eliminated the special
; variable in October 2019, that didn't seem worthwhile to explore.

; Historical Plaque for Why the Live Var for $S Is Not $S

; [Otherwise] Consider how hard it would then be to define the raw defs
; (below).  $S is the formal parameter, and naturally so since we want
; translate to enforce the rules on single-threadedness.  The raw code
; has to check whether the actual is the live object.  We could hardly
; write (eq $S $S).

; End of stobj support in raw lisp

; (such as *initial-global-table*) is independent of the host Common Lisp
; implementation.  That is important to avoid trivial soundness bugs based on

; We return two results.  The first is a list of tests, in reverse

; tests, which should be nil initially.  The second result is an alist
; containing entries of the form (sym expr), suitable for use as the
; bindings in the let we generate if the tests are satisfied.  The
; bindings required by pat are accumulated onto bindings and thus are
; reverse order, although their order is actually irrelevant.

; For example, the pattern
;   ('equal ('car ('cons u v)) u)
; matches only first order instances of (EQUAL (CAR (CONS u v)) u).

; The pattern
;   ('equal (ev (simp x) a) (ev x a))
; matches only second order instances of (EQUAL (ev (simp x) a) (ev x a)),
; i.e., ev, simp, x, and a are all bound in the match.

; In general, the match requires that the cons structure of x be isomorphic
; to that of pat, down to the atoms in pat.  Symbols in the pat denote
; variables that match anything and get bound to the structure matched.
; Occurrences of a symbol after the first match only structures equal to
; the binding.  Non-symbolp atoms match themselves.

; There are some exceptions to the general scheme described above.  A cons
; structure starting with QUOTE matches only itself.  A cons structure of the
; form (QUOTE~ sym), where sym is a symbol, is like (QUOTE sym) except it
; matches any symbol with the same symbol-name as sym.  The symbols nil and t,
; and all symbols whose symbol-name starts with #\* match only structures equal
; to their values.  (These symbols cannot be legally bound in ACL2 anyway, so
; this exceptional treatment does not restrict us further.)  Any symbol
; starting with #\! matches only the value of the symbol whose name is obtained
; by dropping the #\!.  This is a way of referring to already bound variables
; in the pattern. Finally, the symbol & matches anything and causes no binding.
