;  We permit macros under the following constraints on the args.

;  1.  No destructuring.  (Maybe some day.)
;  2.  No &aux.           (LET* is better.)
;  3.  Initforms must be quotes.  (Too hard for us to do evaluation right.)
;  4.  No &environment.   (Just not clearly enough specified in CLTL.)
;  5.  No nonstandard lambda-keywords.  (Of course.)
;  6.  No multiple uses of :allow-other-keys.  (Implementations differ.)

;  There are three nests of functions that have the same view of
;  the subset of macro args that we support:  macro-vars...,
;  chk-macro-arglist..., and bind-macro-args...  Of course, it is
;  necessary to keep them all with the same view of the subset.

; The following code is a ``pseudo'' translation of the functions between
; chk-legal-init-msg and chk-macro-arglist.  Those checkers cause errors when
; their requirements are violated and these functions are just predicates.
; However, they are ``pseudo'' translations because they do not check, for
; example, that alleged variable symbols really are legal variable symbols.
; They are used in the guards for the functions leading up to and including
; macro-vars, which recovers all the variable symbols used in the formals list
; of an acceptable defmacro.

; The following function is just the negation of chk-macro-arglist-keysp, when
; applied to a true-listp args.  The reason it must be applied to a true-listp
; is that macro-arglist-keysp terminates on an endp test and its counterpart
; checker terminates on a null test and may recur one additional time on
; non-true-lists.

; We use a single hash table to restore both function and macro definitions.
; In v4-0 and v4-1 we had separate hash tables for these, but after a bug
; report from Jared Davis that amounted to a CCL issue (error upon redefining a
; macro as a function), we discovered an ACL2 issue, which we now describe
; using an example.

; In our example, the file fn.lisp has the definition
;   (defun f (x)
;     (declare (xargs :guard t))
;     (cons x x))
; while the file mac.lisp has this:
;   (defmacro f (x)
;     x)

; After certifying both books in v4-1, the following sequence of events then
; causes the error shown below in v4-1, as does the sequence obtained by
; switching the order of the include-book forms.  The problem in both cases is
; a failure to restore properly the original definition of f after the failed
; include-book.

; (include-book "fn")
; (include-book "mac") ; fails, as expected (redefinition error)
; (defun g (x)
;   (declare (xargs :guard t))
;   (f x))
; (g 3) ; "Error:  The function F is undefined."

; By using a single hash table (in functions hcomp-init and hcomp-restore-defs)

; Warning: If you are tempted to bind safe-mode to nil outside the boot-strap,
; then revisit the binding of *safe-mode-verified-p* to t in the
; #-acl2-loop-only definition of defconst.  See the defparameter for
; *safe-mode-verified-p*.

; Why do we need to bind safe-mode to t?  An important reason is that we will
; be loading compiled files corresponding to certified books, where defconst
; forms will be evaluated in raw Lisp.  By using safe-mode, we can guarantee
; that these evaluations were free of guard violations when certifying the
; book, and hence will be free of guard violations when loading such compiled
; files.

; But even before we started loading compiled files before processing
; include-book events (i.e., up through Version_3.6.1), safe-mode played an
; important role.  The following legacy comment explains:

; Otherwise [without safe-mode bound to t], if we certify book char-bug-sub
; with a GCL image then we can certify char-bug with an Allegro image, thus
; proving nil.  The problem is that f1 is not properly guarded, yet we go
; directly into the raw Lisp version of f1 when evaluating the defconst.  That
; is just the sort of problem that safe-mode prevents.  See also :doc
; note-2-9-3 for another example, and see the comment about safe-mode related
; to redundancy of a :program mode defun with a previous :logic mode defun, in
; redundant-or-reclassifying-defunp.  And before deciding to remove safe-mode
; here, consider an example like this:

; (defun foo () (declare (xargs :mode :program)) (mbe :logic t :exec nil))
; (defconst *a* (foo))
; ... followed by a theorem about *a*.  If *a* is proved nil, that could
; conflict with a theorem that *a* is t proved after (verify-termination foo).

; Anyhow, here is the char-bug-sub example mentioned above.

; ;;; char-bug-sub.lisp

; (in-package "ACL2")
;
; (defun f1 ()
;   (declare (xargs :mode :program))
;   (char-upcase (code-char 224)))
;
; (defconst *b* (f1))
;
; (defthm gcl-not-allegro

; (include-book "char-bug-sub")
;
; (defthm ouch
;   nil
;   :hints (("Goal" :use gcl-not-allegro))
;   :rule-classes nil)

; However, it is not practical to bind safe-mode to t during the boot-strap
; with user::*fast-acl2-gcl-build*, because we have not yet compiled the *1*
; functions (see add-trip).  For the sake of uniformity, we go ahead and allow
; raw Lisp calls, avoiding safe mode during the boot-strap, even for other

; This "-msg" function supports the community book books/misc/defmac.lisp.

; Any modification to this function and its subordinates must cause
; one to reflect on the two function nests bind-macro-args...  and
; macro-vars... because they assume the presence of the structure that
; this function checks for.  See the comment before macro-vars for the
; restrictions we impose on macros.

; The subordinates of this function do not check that symbols that
; occur in binding spots are non-keywords and non-constants and
; without duplicates.  That check is performed here, with chk-arglist,
; as a final pass.

; Important Note:  If ever we change this function so that instead of
; just checking the args it "translates" the args, so that it returns
; the translated form of a proper arglist, then we must visit a similar
; change on the function primordial-event-macro-and-fn, which currently
; assumes that if a defmacro will be processed without error then
; the macro-args are exactly as presented in the defmacro.

; The idea of translating macro args is not ludicrous.  For example,
; the init-forms in keyword parameters must be quoted right now.  We might
; want to allow naked numbers or strings or t or nil.  But then we'd
; better go look at primordial-event-macro-and-fn.

; It is very suspicious to think about allowing the init forms to be
; anything but quoted constants because Common Lisp is very vague about
; when you get the bindings for free variables in such expressions
; or when such forms are evaluated.

; The following functions support boot-strapping.  Consider what

; Suppose it is (defconst nil 'nil).  It is translated wrt the

; initial world, we won't get off the ground.  The same remark holds
; for the other primitive event functions encountered in axioms.lisp.
; Therefore, before we first call translate we have got to construct a
; world with certain properties already set.

; We compute those properties with the functions below, from the
; following constant.  This constant must be the quoted form of the
; event defmacros found in axioms.lisp!  It was obtained by
; going to the axioms.lisp buffer, grabbing all of the text in the
; "The *initial-event-defmacros* Discussion", moving it over here,
; embedding it in "(defconst *initial-event-defmacros* '(&))" and
; then deleting the #+acl2-loop-only commands, comments, and documentation

; the macro body
; the -fn name corresponding to the macro

; patched things up by using this collection of names at the end of

; values of all world globals.  That was the true motivation of
; collecting the initialization of all globals into one function: so
; we could get 'world-globals so we knew who to float.

   re-defining undone ~ilc[defpkg]s~/

   Suppose ~c[(defpkg \"pkg\" imports)] is the most recently executed
   successful definition of ~c[\"pkg\"] in this ACL2 session and that it
   has since been undone, as by ~c[:]~ilc[ubt].  Any future attempt in this
   session to define ~c[\"pkg\"] as a package must specify an identical
   imports list.~/

   The restriction stems from the need to implement the reinstallation
   of saved logical ~il[world]s as in error recovery and the ~c[:]~ilc[oops] ~il[command].
   Suppose that the new ~ilc[defpkg] attempts to import some symbol, ~c[a::sym],
   not imported by the previous definition of ~c[\"pkg\"].  Because it was
   not imported in the original package, the symbol ~c[pkg::sym], different
   from ~c[a::sym], may well have been created and may well be used in some
   saved ~il[world]s.  Those saved ~il[world]s are Common Lisp objects being held
   for you ``behind the scenes.''  In order to import ~c[a::sym] into
   ~c[\"pkg\"] now we would have to unintern ~c[pkg::sym], rendering those
   saved ~il[world]s ill-formed.  It is because of saved ~il[world]s that we do
   not actually clear out a package when it is undone.

   At one point we thought it was sound to allow the new ~ilc[defpkg] to
   import a subset of the old.  But that is incorrect.  Suppose the old
   definition of ~c[\"pkg\"] imported ~c[a::sym] but the new one does not.
   Suppose we allowed that and implemented it simply by setting the
   imports of ~c[\"pkg\"] to the new subset.  Then consider the conjecture
   ~c[(eq a::sym pkg::sym)].  This ought not be a theorem because we did
   not import ~c[a::sym] into ~c[\"pkg\"].  But in fact in AKCL it is a theorem
   because ~c[pkg::sym] is read as ~c[a::sym] because of the old imports."

; Once upon a time the documentation included the following additional text.
; We deleted it on the grounds that we shouldn't tell the user how to go behind
; our backs.  But we might want to recall this hack in the future for our own
; use.

;    If you really must change the imports list of a previously defined
;    but now undone package, we recommend that you either invent a new
;    package name for subsequent use in this session or that you save
;    your state and reconstruct it in a new ACL2 session.  If you wish to
;    try behind the scenes surgery to allow the new ~ilc[defpkg] to succeed ~-[]
;    at the expense of ACL2's soundness in the rest of the session ~-[]
;    exit ~ilc[lp] and type the following to raw Lisp:
;    ~bv[]
;    (let ((name \"pkg\")           ; fill in pkg name
;          (new-imports '(...))     ; fill in new imports
;          (p (find-package name)))
;      (do-symbols (sym p) (unintern sym p))
;      (import new-imports p)
;      (setq *ever-known-package-alist*
;            (cons (make-package-entry :name name :imports new-imports)
;                  (remove-package-entry name *ever-known-package-alist*)))
;      name)
;    ~ev[]
;    This will render ill-formed any saved ~il[world]s involving symbols in
;    ~c[\"pkg\"] and it may be impossible to recover from certain errors.  In
;    addition, because ACL2 is probably unsound after this hack we
;    recommend that you treat the rest of the session as merely
;    exploratory.

; We now start the development of deftheory and theory expressions.

; First, please read the Essay on Enabling, Enabled Structures, and
; Theories for a refresher course on such things as runes, common
; theories, and runic theories.  Roughly speaking, theory expressions
; are terms that produce common theories as their results.  Recall
; that a common theory is a truelist of rule name designators.  A rule
; name designator is an object standing for a set of runes; examples
; include APP, which might stand for {(:DEFINITION app)}, (APP), which
; might stand for {(:EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART app)}, and LEMMA1, which
; might stand for the set of runes {(REWRITE lemma1 . 1) (REWRITE
; lemma1 . 2) (ELIM lemma1)}.  Of course, a rune is a rule name designator
; and stands for the obvious: the singleton set containing that rune.

; To every common theory there corresponds a runic theory, obtained
; from the common theory by unioning together the designated sets of
; runes and then ordering the result by nume.  Runic theories are
; easier to manipulate (e.g., union together) because they are
; ordered.

; To define deftheory we need not define any any "theory manipulation
; functions" (e.g., union-theories, or universal-theory) because
; deftheory just does a full-blown eval of whatever expression the
; user provides.  We could therefore define deftheory now.  But there
; are a lot of useful theory manipulation functions and they are
; generally used only in deftheory and in-theory, so we define them
; now.

; Calls of these functions will be typed by the user in theory
; expressions.  Those expressions will be executed to obtain new
; theories.  Furthermore, the user may well define his own theory
; producing functions which will be mixed in with ours in his
; expressions.  How do we know a "theory expression" will produce a
; theory?  We don't.  We just evaluate it and check the result.  But
; this raises a more serious question: how do we know our theory
; manipulation functions are given theories as their arguments?
; Indeed, they may not be given theories because of misspellings, bugs
; in the user's functions, etc.  Because of the presence of
; user-defined functions in theory expressions we can't syntactically
; check that an expression is ok.  And at the moment we don't see that
; it is worth the trouble of making the user prove "theory theorems"
; such as (THEORYP A W) -> (THEORYP (MY-FN A) W) that would let us so
; analyze his expressions.

; So we have decided to put run-time checks into our theory functions.
; We have two methods available to us: we could put guards on them or
; we could put checks into them.  The latter course does not permit us
; to abort on undesired arguments -- because we don't want theory
; functions to take STATE and be multi-valued.  Thus, once past the
; guards all we can do is coerce unwanted args into acceptable ones.

; There are several sources of tension.  It was such tensions that
; led to the idea of "common" v. "runic" theories and, one level deeper,
; "rule name designators" v. runes.

; (1) When our theory functions are getting input directly from the
;     user we wish they did a throrough job of checking it and were
;     forgiving about such things as order, e.g., sorted otherwise ok
;     lists, so that the user didn't need to worry about order.

; (2) When our theory functions are getting input produced by one of
;     our functions, we wish they didn't check anything so they could
;     just fly.

; (3) These functions have to be admissible under the definitional principle
;     and not cause errors when called on the utter garbage that the user
;     might type.

; (4) Checking the well-formedness of a theory value requires access to
;     wrld.

; We have therefore chosen the following strategy.

; First, all theory manipulation functions take wrld as an argument.
; Some need it, e.g., the function that returns all the available rule
; names.  Others wouldn't need it if we made certain choices on the
; handling of run-time checks.  We've chosen to be uniform: all have
; it.  This uniformity saves the user from having to remember which
; functions do and which don't.

; Second, all theory functions have guards that check that their
; "theory" arguments "common theories."  This means that if a theory
; function is called on utter garbage the user will get an error
; message.  But it means we'll pay the price of scanning each theory
; value on each function entry in his expression to check
; rule-name-designatorp.

; To compute on theories we will convert common theories to runic ones
; (actually, all the way to augmented runic theories) and we will
; always return runic theories because they can be verified faster.
; This causes a second scan every time but in general will not go into
; sorting because our intermediate results will always be ordered.
; This gives us "user-friendliness" for top-level calls of the theory
; functions without (too much?)  overhead.

; Now we define union, intersect, and set-difference for lists of rule
; names.

(defun theory-fn-callp (x)

; We return t or nil.  If t, and the evaluation of x does not cause an error,
; then the result is a runic-theoryp.  Here x is an untranslated term; see also
; theory-fn-translated-callp for translated terms x.  It would be sound to
; return non-nil here if theory-fn-translated-callp returns non-nil, but that
; doesn't seem useful for user-level terms (though we may want to reconsider).

  not introduce rules (e.g., ~ilc[defmacro], ~ilc[defconst] or ~ilc[defthm] with
  ~c[:]~ilc[rule-classes] ~c[nil]), the universal-theory does not necessarily
  include a ~il[rune] for every event name.)  The universal-theory is very
  long and you will probably regret printing it.

  You may experience a fencepost problem in deciding which
  ~il[logical-name] to use.  ~ilc[Deflabel] can always be used to mark
  unambiguously for future reference a particular point in the
  development of your theory.  This is convenient because ~ilc[deflabel]
  does not introduce any rules and hence it doesn't matter if you
  count it as being in the interval or not.  The order of ~il[events] in
  the vicinity of an ~ilc[encapsulate] is confusing.  ~l[encapsulate].

  This ``function'' is actually a macro that expands to a term
  mentioning the single free variable ~ilc[world].  When theory expressions
  are evaluated by ~ilc[in-theory] or the ~c[:]~ilc[in-theory] hint, ~ilc[world] is bound to
  the current ACL2 ~il[world].

  Also ~pl[current-theory].  ~c[Current-theory] is much more commonly used than
  ~c[universal-theory].  The former includes only the ~il[enable]d ~il[rune]s
  as of the given ~ilc[logical-name], which is probably what you want, while
  the latter includes ~il[disable]d ones as well.~/

; Essay on Theory Manipulation Performance

; Below we show some statistics on our theory manipulation functions.
; These are recorded in case we someday change these functions and
; wish to compare the old and new implementations.  The expressions
; shown should be executed in raw lisp, not LP, because they involve
; the time function.  These expressions were executed in a newly
; initialized ACL2.  The times are on a Sparc 2 (Rana).

; The following expression is intended as a "typical" heavy duty
; theory expression.  For the record, the universal theory at the time
; of these tests contained 1307 runes.

; (let ((world (w *the-live-state*)))
;   (time
;    (length
;     (union-theories
;      (intersection-theories (current-theory :here)
;                             (executable-counterpart-theory :here))
;      (set-difference-theories (universal-theory :here)
;                               (function-theory :here))))))

; Repeated runs were done.  Typical results were:
;   real time : 0.350 secs
;   run time  : 0.233 secs
;   993

; The use of :here above meant that all the theory functions involved
; just looked up their answers in the 'standard-theories at
; the front of the initialized world.  The following expression forces
; the exploration of the whole world.  In the test, "ACL2-USER" was
; the event printed by :pc -1, i.e., the last event before ending the
; boot.

; (let ((world (w *the-live-state*)))
;   (time
;    (length
;     (union-theories
;      (intersection-theories (current-theory "ACL2-USER")
;                             (executable-counterpart-theory "ACL2-USER"))
;      (set-difference-theories (universal-theory "ACL2-USER")
;                               (function-theory "ACL2-USER"))))))

; Repeated tests produced the following typical results.
;   real time : 0.483 secs
;   run time  : 0.383 secs
;   993
; The first run, however, had a real time of almost 10 seconds because
; wrld had to be paged in.

; The final test stresses sorting.  We return to the :here usage to
; get our theories, but we reverse the output every chance we get so
; as force the next theory function to sort.  In addition, we
; strip-cadrs all the input runic theories to force the reconstruction
; of runic theories from the wrld.

; (let ((world (w *the-live-state*)))
;   (time
;    (length
;     (union-theories
;      (reverse
;       (intersection-theories

;         (reverse (strip-base-symbols (universal-theory :here)))
;         (reverse (strip-base-symbols (function-theory :here)))))))))

; Typical times were
;   real time : 1.383 secs
;   run time  : 0.667 secs
;   411
; The size of the result is smaller because the strip-cadrs identifies
; several runes, e.g., (:DEFINITION fn) and (:EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART
; fn) both become fn which is then understood as (:DEFINITION fn).

; Warning: If this event ever generates proof obligations, remove it from the

; skip-proofs".

; Historical Note:  Once upon a time deftheory-fn did not exist even
; though deftheory did.  We defined deftheory as a macro which expanded
; into a defconstant-fn expression.  In particular,

; (deftheory *a* (union *b* (universe w)))

; was mapped to

; (er-let* ((lst (translate-in-theory-hint
;                   '(union *b* (universe w))
;                   nil
;                   '(deftheory . *a*)
;                   (w state)

;            (list 'quote lst)
;            state
;            nil))

; Thus, the "semantics" of a successful execution of deftheory was that of
; defconstant.  This suffered from letting theories creep into formulas.  For
; example, one could later write in a proposed theorem (member 'foo *a*) and
; the truth of that proposition depended upon the particular theory computed
; for *a*.  This made it impossible to permit either the use of state in
; "theory expressions" (since different theories could be computed for
; identical worlds, depending on ld-skip-proofsp) or the use of deftheory in
; encapsulate (see below).  The state prohibition forced upon us the ugliness
; of permitting the user to reference the current ACL2 world via the free
; variable W in theory expressions, which we bound appropriately before evaling
; the expressions.

; We abandoned the use of defconstant (now defconst) for these reasons.

; Here is a comment that once illustrated why we did not allow deftheory
; to be used in encapsulate:

; We do not allow deftheory expressions in encapsulate.  This may be a
; severe restriction but it is necessary for soundness given the current
; implementation of deftheory.  Consider the following:

; (encapsulate nil
;   (local (defun foo () 1))
;   (deftheory *u* (all-names w))
;   (defthm foo-thm (member 'foo *u*)))

; where all-names is a user defined function that computes the set of
; all names in a given world.  [Note: Intuitively, (all-names w) is
; (universal-theory nil w).  Depending on how event descriptors are
; handled, that may or may not be correct.  In a recent version of
; ACL2, (universal-theory nil w), if used in an encapsulate, had the
; effect of computing all the names in the theory as of the last
; world-chaning form executed by the top-level loop.  But because
; encapsulate did not so mark each term as it executed them,
; universal-theory backed up to the point in w just before the
; encapsulate.  Thus, universal-theory could not be used to get the
; effect intended here.  However, (all-names w) could be defined by
; the user to get what is intended here.]

; When the above sequence is processed in pass 1 of encapsulate *u*
; includes 'foo and hence the defthm succeeds.  But when it is processed
; in pass 2 *u* does not include 'foo and so the assumption of the
; defthm is unsound!  In essence, permitting deftheory in encapsulate is
; equivalent to permitting (w state) in defconst forms.  That is
; disallowed too (as is the use of any variable in an defconst form).
; If you can set a constant as a function of the world, then you can use
; the constant to determine which encapsulate pass you are in.

  o ~c[term] is a term that uses no variables other than ~c[ens] and
  ~ilc[state];

  o ~c[key] is an arbitrary ``name'' for this invariant (if omitted, an integer
  is generated and used); and

  o ~c[:error] specifies the action to be taken when an invariant is violated
  ~-[] either ~c[nil] if a warning is to be printed, else ~c[t] (the default)
  if an error is to be caused.

  ~eq[]~c[Theory-invariant] is an event that adds to or modifies the ~il[table]
  of user-supplied theory invariants that are checked each time a theory
  expression is evaluated.

  The theory invariant mechanism is provided via a table
  (~pl[table]) named ~c[theory-invariant-table].  In fact, the
  ~c[theory-invariant] ``event'' is just a macro that expands into a use of the
  ~ilc[table] event.  More general access to the ~c[theory-invariant]
  ~il[table] is provided by ~ilc[table] itself.  For example, the ~il[table]
  can be inspected or cleared with ~ilc[table]; you can clear an individual
  theory invariant by setting the invariant to ~c[t], or eliminate all theory
  invariants with the command ~c[(table theory-invariant-table nil nil :clear)].

  ~c[Theory-invariant-table] maps arbitrary keys to records containing terms
  that mention, at most, the variables ~c[ens] and ~ilc[state].  Every time an
  alleged theory expression is evaluated, e.g., in the ~ilc[in-theory] event or
  ~c[:]~ilc[in-theory] hint, each of the terms in ~c[theory-invariant-table] is
  evaluated with ~c[ens] bound to a so-called ``enabled structure'' obtained
  from the theory expression and ~ilc[state] bound to the current ACL2 state
  (~pl[state]).  Users generally need not know about the enabled structure,
  other than that it can be accessed using the macros ~c[active-runep] and
  ~c[incompatible]; ~pl[active-runep] and ~pl[incompatible].  If the result is
  ~c[nil], a message is printed and an error occurs (except, only a warning
  occurs if ~c[:error nil] is specified).  Thus, the ~il[table] can be thought
  of as a list of conjuncts.  Each ~c[term] in the ~il[table] has a ``name,''
  which is just the key under which the term is stored.  When a theory violates
  the restrictions specified by some term, both the name and the term are
  printed.  By calling ~c[theory-invariant] with a new term but the same name,
  you can overwrite that conjunct of the theory invariant; but see the Local
  Redefinition Caveat at the end of this note.  You may want to avoid using
  explicit names, since otherwise the subsequent inclusion of another book that
  defines a theory invariant with the same name will override your theory
  invariant.

  Theory invariants are particularly useful in the context of large rule sets
  intended for re-use.  Such sets often contain conflicting rules, e.g., rules
  that are to be ~il[enable]d when certain function symbols are ~il[disable]d,
  rules that rewrite in opposite directions and thus loop if simultaneously
  ~il[enable]d, groups of rules which should be ~il[enable]d in concert, etc.
  The developer of such rule sets understands these restrictions and probably
  documents them.  The theory invariant mechanism allows the developer to
  codify his restrictions so that the user is alerted when they are violated.

  Since theory invariants are arbitrary terms, macros may be used to
  express commonly used restrictions.  For example, executing the event
  ~bv[]
  (theory-invariant (incompatible (:rewrite left-to-right)
                                  (:rewrite right-to-left)))
  ~ev[]
  would subsequently cause an error any time the current theory contained both
  of the two ~il[rune]s shown.  Of course, ~il[incompatible] is just defined as
  a macro.  Its definition may be inspected with ~c[:pe incompatible].

  In order for a ~c[theory-invariant] event to be accepted, the proposed theory
  invariant must be satisfied by the current theory (~pl[current-theory]).  The
  value returned upon successful execution of the event is the key (whether
  user-supplied or generated).

  Local Redefinition Caveat.  Care needs to be taken when redefining a theory
  invariant in a ~il[local] context.  Consider the following example.

  ~bv[]
  (theory-invariant
   (active-runep '(:definition binary-append))
   :key app-inv)

  (encapsulate
   ()
   (local (theory-invariant t :key app-inv))
   (in-theory (disable binary-append))
   (defthm ...))
  ~ev[]
  The second pass of the ~ilc[encapsulate] will fail, because the
  ~ilc[in-theory] event violates the original ~c[theory-invariant] and the
  ~ilc[local] ~c[theory-invariant] is skipped in the second pass of the
  ~ilc[encapsulate].  Of course, ~ilc[local] ~ilc[theory-invariant]s in
  ~il[books] can cause the analogous problem in the second (~ilc[include-book])
  pass of a ~ilc[certify-book].  In both cases, though, the theory invariants
  are only checked at the conclusion of the (~c[include-book] or
  ~c[encapsulate]) event.  Indeed, theory invariants are checked at the end of
  every event related to ~il[theories], including ~ilc[defun], ~ilc[defthm],
  ~ilc[in-theory], ~ilc[encapsulate], and ~ilc[include-book], except for events
  executed on behalf of an ~ilc[include-book] or the second pass of an
  ~ilc[encapsulate].~/"

  how to specify the arity of a constrained function~/

  We start with a gentle introduction to signatures, where we pretend that
  there are no single-threaded objects (more on that below ~-[] for now, if you
  don't know anything about single-threaded objects, that's fine!).  Here are
  some simple examples of signatures.
  ~bv[]
  ((hd *) => *)
  ((pair * *) => *)
  ((foo * *) => (mv * * *))
  ~ev[]
  The first of these says that ~c[hd] is a function of one argument, while the
  other two say that ~c[pair] and ~c[foo] are functions that each take two
  arguments.  The first two say that ~c[hd] and ~c[pair] return a single
  value.  The third says that ~c[foo] returns three values, much as the
  following definition returns three values:
  ~bv[]
  (defun bar (x y)
    (mv y x (cons x y)))
  ~ev[]

  Corresponding ``old-style'' signatures are as follows.  In each case, a
  function symbol is followed by a list of formal parameters and then either
  ~c[t], to denote a single value return, or ~c[(mv t t t)], to denote a
  multiple value return (in this case, returning three values).
  ~bv[]
  (hd (x) t)
  (pair (x y) t)
  (foo (x y) (mv t t t))
  ~ev[]

  That concludes our gentle introduction.  The documentation below is more
  general, for example covering single-threaded objects and keyword values such
  as ~c[:guard].  When reading what follows below, it is sufficient to know
  about single-threaded objects (or ``stobjs'') that each has a unique symbolic
  name and that ~ilc[state] is the name of the only built-in single-threaded
  object.  All other stobjs are introduced by the user via ~ilc[defstobj] or
  ~ilc[defabsstobj].  An object that is not a single-threaded object is said to
  be ``ordinary.''  For a discussion of single-threaded objects, ~pl[stobj].~/

  ~bv[]
  Examples:
  ((hd *) => *)
  ((hd *) => * :formals (x) :guard (consp x))
  ((printer * state) => (mv * * state))
  ((mach * mach-state * state) => (mv * mach-state))

  General Form:
  ((fn ...) => *)
  ((fn ...) => stobj)
  or
  ((fn ...) => (mv ...))
  or for part1 and part2 as above,
  (part1 => part2 :kwd1 val1 ... :kwdn valn)
  ~ev[]
  where ~c[fn] is the constrained function symbol, ~c[...] is a list of
  asterisks and/or the names of single-threaded objects, ~c[stobj] is a
  single-threaded object name, and the optional ~c[:kwdi] and ~c[:vali] are as
  described below.  ACL2 also supports an older style of signature, described
  below after we describe the preferred style.

  Signatures specify three syntactic aspects of a function symbol: (1) the
  ``arity'' or how many arguments the function takes, (2) the ``multiplicity''
  or how many results it returns via ~c[MV], and (3) which of those arguments
  and results are single-threaded objects and which objects they are.

  A signature typically has the form ~c[((fn x1 ... xn) => val)].  Such a
  signature has two parts, separated by the symbol ``=>''.  The first part,
  ~c[(fn x1 ... xn)], is suggestive of a call of the constrained function.  The
  number of ``arguments,'' ~c[n], indicates the arity of ~c[fn].  Each ~c[xi]
  must be a symbol.  If a given ~c[xi] is the symbol ``*'' then the
  corresponding argument must be ordinary.  If a given ~c[xi] is any other
  symbol, that symbol must be the name of a single-threaded object and the
  corresponding argument must be that object.  No stobj name may occur twice
  among the ~c[xi].

  The second part, ~c[val], of a signature is suggestive of a term and
  indicates the ``shape'' of the output of ~c[fn].  If ~c[val] is a symbol then
  it must be either the symbol ``*'' or the name of a single-threaded object.
  In either case, the multiplicity of ~c[fn] is 1 and ~c[val] indicates whether
  the result is ordinary or a stobj.  Otherwise, ~c[val] is of the form
  ~c[(mv y1 ... yk)], where ~c[k] > 1.  Each ~c[yi] must be either the symbol
  ``*'' or the name of a stobj.  Such a ~c[val] indicates that ~c[fn] has
  multiplicity ~c[k] and the ~c[yi] indicate which results are ordinary and
  which are stobjs.  No stobj name may occur twice among the ~c[yi], and
  a stobj name may appear in ~c[val] only if appears among the ~c[xi].

  A signature may have the form ~c[((fn x1 ... xn) => val . k)], where ~c[k] is
  a ~ilc[keyword-value-listp], i.e., an alternating list of keywords and values
  starting with a keyword.  In this case ~c[((fn x1 ... xn) => val)] must be a
  legal signature as described above.  The legal keywords in ~c[k] are
  ~c[:GUARD] and ~c[:FORMALS] (except that for ACL2(r), also see the remark
  about ~c[:CLASSICALP] later in this topic).  The value following ~c[:FORMALS]
  is to be the list of formal parameters of ~c[fn], while the value following
  ~c[:GUARD] is a term that is to be the ~il[guard] of ~c[fn].  Note that this
  guard is never actually evaluated, and is not subject to the guard
  verification performed on functions introduced by ~ilc[defun]
  (~pl[verify-guards]).  Said differently: this guard need not itself have a
  guard of ~c[t].  Indeed, the guard is only used for attachments;
  ~pl[defattach].  Note that if ~c[:GUARD] is supplied then ~c[:FORMALS] must
  also be supplied (in order to related the variables occurring in the guard to
  the parameters of ~c[fn]).  One final observation about guards: if the
  ~c[:GUARD] keyword is omitted, then the guard defaults to ~c[T].

  Before ACL2 supported user-declared single-threaded objects there was only
  one single-threaded object: ACL2's built-in notion of ~ilc[state].  The
  notion of signature supported then gave a special role to the symbol
  ~c[state] and all other symbols were considered to denote ordinary objects.
  ACL2 still supports the old form of signature, but it is limited to functions
  that operate on ordinary objects or ordinary objects and ~c[state].

  ~bv[]
  Old-Style General Form:
  (fn formals result . k)
  ~ev[]

  where ~c[fn] is the constrained function symbol, ~c[formals] is a suitable
  list of formal parameters for it, ~c[k] is an optional
  ~ilc[keyword-value-listp] (see below), and ~c[result] is either a symbol
  denoting that the function returns one result or else ~c[result] is an
  ~ilc[mv] expression, ~c[(mv s1 ... sn)], where ~c[n>1], each ~c[si] is a
  symbol, indicating that the function returns ~c[n] results.  At most one of
  the formals may be the symbol ~c[STATE], indicating that corresponding
  argument must be ACL2's built-in ~ilc[state].  If ~c[state] appears in
  ~c[formals] then ~c[state] may appear once in ~c[result].  All ``variable
  symbols'' other than ~c[state] in old style signatures denote ordinary
  objects, regardless of whether the symbol has been defined to be a
  single-threaded object name!

  The optional ~c[k] is as described above for newer-style signatures, except
  that the user is also allowed to declare which symbols (besides ~c[state])
  are to be considered single-threaded object names.  Thus ~c[:STOBJS] is also
  a legal keyword.  The form
  ~bv[]
  (fn formals result ... :stobjs names ...)
  ~ev[]
  specifies that ~c[names] is either the name of a single-threaded object or
  else is a list of such names.  Every name in ~c[names] must have been
  previously defined as a stobj via ~ilc[defstobj] or ~ilc[defabsstobj].

  As promised above, we conclude with a remark about an additional keyword,
  ~c[:CLASSICALP], that is legal for ACL2(r) (~pl[real]).  The value of this
  keyword must be ~c[t] (the default) or ~c[nil], indicating respectively
  whether ~c[fn] is classical or not.~/")

; The following is a complete list of the macros that are considered

; property that while it takes state as an argument and possibly
; changes it, the world it produces is a function only of the world in
; the incoming state and the other arguments.  The function does not
; change the world as a function of, say, some global variable in the
; state.

; The claim above, about changing the world, is inaccurate for include-book!
; It changes the world as a function of the contents of some arbitrarily
; named input object file.  How this can be explained, I'm not sure.

; All event functions have the property that they install into state
; the world they produce, when they return non-erroneously.  More
; subtly they have the property that when the cause an error, they do
; not change the installed world.  For simple events, such as DEFUN
; and DEFTHM, this is ensured by not installing any world until the
; final STOP-EVENT.  But for compound events, such as ENCAPSULATE and
; INCLUDE-BOOK, it is ensured by the more expensive use of
; REVERT-WORLD-ON-ERROR.

; Warning: If a symbol is on this list then it is allowed into books.

; on this list have #-acl2-loop-only definitions that make them
; no-ops.  At least one, defstub, expands into a perfectly suitable

; semantics for the compiler.

; Warning: If this list is changed, inspect the following definitions,

; list *fmt-ctx-spacers* as well.

; We define later the notion of an embedded event.  Only such events
; can be included in the body of an ENCAPSULATE or a file named by
; INCLUDE-BOOK.

; We do not allow defpkg as an embedded event.  In fact, we do not allow
; defpkg anywhere in a blessed set of files except in files that contain
; nothing but top-level defpkg forms (and those files must not be compiled).
; The reason is explained in deflabel embedded-event-form below.

; Once upon a time we allowed in-package expressions inside of
; encapsulates, in a "second class" way.  That is, they were not
; allowed to be hidden in LOCAL forms.  But the whole idea of putting
; in-package expressions in encapsulated event lists is silly:
; In-package is meant to change the package into which subsequent
; forms are read.  But no reading is being done by encapsulate and the
; entire encapsulate event list is read into whatever was the current
; package when the encapsulate was read.

; Here is an example of why in-package should never be hidden (i.e.,
; in LOCAL), even in a top-level list of events in a file.

; Consider the following list of events:

; (DEFPKG ACL2-MY-PACKAGE '(DEFTHM SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME EQUAL))

; (LOCAL (IN-PACKAGE "ACL2-MY-PACKAGE"))

; (DEFTHM GOTCHA (EQUAL (SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME 'IF) "ACL2-MY-PACKAGE"))

; When processed in pass 1, the IN-PACKAGE is executed and thus
; the subsequent form (and hence the symbol 'IF) is read into package
; ACL2-MY-PACKAGE.  Thus, the equality evaluates to T and GOTCHA is a
; theorem.  But when processed in pass 2, the IN-PACKAGE is not
; executed and the subsequent form is read into the "ACL2" package.  The
; equality evaluates to NIL and GOTCHA is not a theorem.

  o ~c[x] is of the form ~c[(]~ilc[MAKE-EVENT]~c[ &)], where ~c[&] is any term

  ~eq[]
  An exception: an embedded event form may not set the
  ~ilc[acl2-defaults-table] when in the context of ~ilc[local].  Thus for
  example, the form
  ~bv[]
  (local (table acl2-defaults-table :defun-mode :program))
  ~ev[]
  is not an embedded event form, nor is the form ~c[(local (program))],
  since the latter sets the ~ilc[acl2-defaults-table] implicitly.  An
  example at the end of the discussion below illustrates why there is
  this restriction.

  Only embedded event forms are allowed in a book after its initial
  ~ilc[in-package] form.  ~l[books].  However, you may find that
  ~ilc[make-event] allows you to get the effect you want for a form that is not
  an embedded event form.  For example, you can put the following into a book,
  which assigns the value 17 to ~ilc[state] global variable ~c[x]:
  ~bv[]
  (make-event (er-progn (assign x 17)
                        (value '(value-triple nil)))
              :check-expansion t)
  ~ev[]

  When an embedded event is executed while ~ilc[ld-skip-proofsp] is
  ~c[']~ilc[include-book], those parts of it inside ~ilc[local] forms are
  ignored.  Thus,
  ~bv[]
     (progn (defun f1 () 1)
            (local (defun f2 () 2))
            (defun f3 () 3))
  ~ev[]
  will define ~c[f1], ~c[f2], and ~c[f3] when ~ilc[ld-skip-proofsp] is ~c[nil]
  or ~c[t], but will define only ~c[f1] and ~c[f3] when ~ilc[ld-skip-proofsp]
  is ~c[']~ilc[include-book].

  ~em[Discussion:]

  ~ilc[Encapsulate], ~ilc[progn], and ~ilc[include-book] place restrictions on
  the kinds of forms that may be processed.  These restrictions ensure that the
  non-local ~il[events] are indeed admissible provided that the sequence of
  ~ilc[local] and non-local ~il[events] is admissible when proofs are done,
  i.e., when ~c[ld-skip-proofs] is ~c[nil].  But ~ilc[progn!] places no such
  restrictions, hence is potentially dangerous and should be avoided unless you
  understand the ramifications; so it is illegal unless there is an active
  trust tag (~pl[defttag]).

  ~ilc[Local] permits the hiding of an event or group of ~il[events] in the
  sense that ~ilc[local] ~il[events] are processed when we are trying to
  establish the admissibility of a sequence of ~il[events] embedded in
  ~ilc[encapsulate] forms or in ~il[books], but are ignored when we are
  constructing the ~il[world] produced by assuming that sequence.  Thus, for
  example, a particularly ugly and inefficient ~c[:]~ilc[rewrite] rule might be
  made ~ilc[local] to an ~il[encapsulate] that ``exports'' a desirable theorem
  whose proof requires the ugly lemma.

  To see why we can't allow just anything as an embedded event, consider
  allowing the form
  ~bv[]
  (if (ld-skip-proofsp state)
      (defun foo () 2)
      (defun foo () 1))
  ~ev[]
  followed by
  ~bv[]
  (defthm foo-is-1 (equal (foo) 1)).
  ~ev[]
  When we process the ~il[events] with ~ilc[ld-skip-proofsp] is ~c[nil], the
  second ~ilc[defun] is executed and the ~ilc[defthm] succeeds.  But when we
  process the ~il[events] with ~ilc[ld-skip-proofsp] ~c[']~ilc[include-book],
  the second ~ilc[defun] is executed, so that ~c[foo] no longer has the same
  definition it did when we proved ~c[foo-is-1].  Thus, an invalid formula is
  assumed when we process the ~ilc[defthm] while skipping proofs.  Thus, the
  first form above is not a legal embedded event form.

  If you encounter a situation where these restrictions seem to prevent you
  from doing what you want to do, then you may find ~c[make-event] to be
  helpful.  ~l[make-event].

  ~ilc[Defpkg] is not allowed because it affects how things are read after
  it is executed.  But all the forms embedded in an event are read
  before any are executed.  That is,
  ~bv[]
  (encapsulate nil
               (defpkg \"MY-PKG\" nil)
               (defun foo () 'my-pkg::bar))
  ~ev[]
  makes no sense since ~c[my-pkg::bar] must have been read before the
  ~ilc[defpkg] for ~c[\"MY-PKG\"] was executed.

  Finally, let us elaborate on the restriction mentioned earlier
  related to the ~ilc[acl2-defaults-table].  Consider the following form.
  ~bv[]
  (encapsulate
   ()
   (local (program))
   (defun foo (x)
     (if (equal 0 x)
         0
       (1+ (foo (- x))))))
  ~ev[]
  ~l[local-incompatibility] for a discussion of how ~ilc[encapsulate] processes
  event forms.  Briefly, on the first pass through the ~il[events] the
  definition of ~c[foo] will be accepted in ~ilc[defun] mode
  ~c[:]~ilc[program], and hence accepted.  But on the second pass the form
  ~c[(local (program))] is skipped because it is marked as ~ilc[local], and
  hence ~c[foo] is accepted in ~ilc[defun] mode ~c[:]~ilc[logic].  Yet, no
  proof has been performed in order to admit ~c[foo], and in fact, it is not
  hard to prove a contradiction from this definition!~/")

; find-first-non-local-name.

; Note: For a test of this function, see the reference to foo.lisp below.

; Orig-form is used for error reporting.  It is either nil, indicating that
; errors should refer to form, or else it is a form from a superior call of
; this function.  So it is typical, though not required, to call this with
; orig-form = nil at the top level.  If we encounter a macro call and orig-form
; is nil, then we set orig-form to the macro call so that the user can see that
; macro call if the check fails.

; This function checks that form is a tree whose tips are calls of the symbols
; listed in names, and whose interior nodes are each of one of the following
; forms.

; (local &)
; (skip-proofs &)
; (with-output ... &)
; (with-prover-step-limit ... &)
; (with-prover-time-limit ... &)
; (make-event #)

; where each & is checked.  The # forms above are unrestricted, although the
; result of expanding the argument of make-event (by evaluation) is checked.
; Note that both 'encapsulate and 'progn are typically in names, and their
; sub-events aren't checked by this function until evaluation time.

; In addition, if portcullisp is t we are checking that the forms are
; acceptable as the portcullis of some book and we enforce the additional
; restriction noted below.

;   (local &) is illegal because such a command would be skipped
;   when executing the portcullis during the subsequent include-book.

; Formerly we also checked here that include-book is only applied to absolute
; pathnames.  That was important for insuring that the book that has been read
; into the certification world is not dependent upon :cbd.  Remember that
; (include-book "file") will find its way into the portcullis of the book we
; are certifying and there is no way of knowing in the portcullis which
; directory that book comes from if it doesn't explicitly say.  However, we now
; use fix-portcullis-cmds to modify include-book forms that use relative
; pathnames so that they use absolute pathnames instead, or cause an error
; trying.

; We allow defaxioms, skip-proofs, and defttags in the portcullis, but we mark
; the book's certificate appropriately.

; In-local-flg is used to enforce restrictions in the context of LOCAL on the
; use of (table acl2-defaults-table ...), either directly or by way of events
; such as defun-mode events and set-compile-fns that set this table.  (We used
; to make these restrictions when portcullisp is t, because we restored the
; initial acl2-defaults-table before certification, and hence it was misguided
; for the user to be setting the defun-mode or the compile flag in the
; certification world since they were irrelevant to the world in which the
; certification is done.)  A non-nil value of in-local-flg means that we are in
; the scope of LOCAL.  In that case, if we are lexically within an encapsulate
; but not LOCAL when restricted to the nearest such encapsulate, then
; in-local-flg is 'local-encapsulate.  Otherwise, if we are in the scope of
; LOCAL, but we are in an included book and not in the scope of LOCAL with
; respect to that book, then in-local-flg is 'local-include-book.

; Moreover, we do not allow local defaxiom events.  Imagine locally including a
; book that has nil as a defaxiom.  You can prove anything you want in your
; book, and then when you later include the book, there will be no trace of the
; defaxiom in your logical world!

; We do not check that the tips are well-formed calls of the named functions
; (though we do ensure that they are all true lists).

; If names is primitive-event-macros and form can be translated and evaluated
; without error, then it is in fact an embedded event form as described in :DOC
; embedded-event-form.

; We sometimes call this function with names extended by the addition of
; 'DEFPKG.

; If form is rejected, the error message is that printed by str, with #\0 bound
; to the subform (of form) that was rejected.

; We return a value triple (mv erp val state).  If erp is nil then val is the
; event form to be evaluated.  Generally that is the result of macroexpanding
; the input form.  However, if (perhaps after some macroexpansion) form is a
; call of local that should be skipped, then val is nil.

  Below we discuss raw-mode.  In brief: The simplest way to turn raw-mode on is
  ~c[:SET-RAW-MODE-ON!], and to turn it off, ~c[:SET-RAW-MODE NIL].  Also
  ~pl[set-raw-mode-on!].~/

  ACL2 users often find its careful syntax checking to be helpful during code
  development.  Sometimes it is even useful to do code development in
  ~c[:]~ilc[logic] mode, where ACL2 can be used to check termination of
  (mutually) recursive functions, verify guards, or even prove properties of
  the functions.

  However, loading code using ~ilc[include-book] is much slower than using
  Common Lisp ~c[load] in raw Lisp, and in this sense ACL2 can get in the way
  of efficient execution.  Unfortunately, it is error-prone to use ACL2 sources
  (or their compilations) in raw Lisp, primarily because a number of ACL2
  primitives will not let you do so.  Perhaps you have seen this error message
  when trying to do so:
  ~bv[]
  HARD ACL2 ERROR in ACL2-UNWIND-PROTECT:  Apparently you have tried
  to execute a form in raw Lisp that is only intended to be executed
  inside the ACL2 loop.
  ~ev[]
  Even without this problem it is important to enter the ACL2 loop (~pl[lp]),
  for example in order to set the ~ilc[cbd] and (to get more technical) the
  readtable.

  ACL2 provides a ``raw mode'' for execution of raw Lisp forms.  In this mode,
  ~ilc[include-book] reduces essentially to a Common Lisp ~c[load].  More
  generally, the ACL2 logical ~ilc[world] is not routinely extended in raw mode
  (some sneaky tricks are probably required to make that happen).  To turn raw
  mode off or on:
  ~bv[]
  :set-raw-mode t   ; turn raw mode on
  :set-raw-mode nil ; turn raw mode off
  ~ev[]

  The way you can tell that you are in raw mode is by looking at the prompt
  (~pl[default-print-prompt]), which uses a capital ``~c[P]'' (suggesting
  something like program mode, but more so).
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 P>
  ~ev[]

  Typical benefits of raw mode are fast loading of source and compiled files
  and the capability to hack arbitrary Common Lisp code in an environment with
  the ACL2 sources loaded (and hence with ACL2 primitives available).  In
  addition, ACL2 hard errors will put you into the Lisp debugger, rather than
  returning you to the ACL2 loop, and this may be helpful for debugging;
  ~pl[hard-error] and ~pl[illegal], but also ~pl[break-on-error].  However, it
  probably is generally best to avoid raw mode unless these advantages seem
  important.  We expect the main benefit of raw mode to be in deployment of
  applications, where load time is much faster than the time required for a
  full-blown ~ilc[include-book], although in certain cases the fast loading of
  books and treatment of hard errors discussed above may be useful during
  development.

  Raw mode is also useful for those who want to build extensions of ACL2.  For
  example, the following form can be put into a certifiable book to load an
  arbitrary Common Lisp source or compiled file.
  ~bv[]
  (progn (defttag my-application)
         (progn! (set-raw-mode t)
                 (load \"some-file\")))
  ~ev[]
  Also see ~c[with-raw-mode] defined in community book
  ~c[books/hacking/hacker.lisp], ~pl[defttag], and ~pl[progn!].

  Below are several disadvantages to raw mode.  These should discourage users
  from using it for general code development, as ~c[:]~ilc[program] mode is
  generally preferable.
  ~bf[]
  -- Forms are in essence executed in raw Lisp.  Hence:
     -- Syntax checking is turned off; and
     -- Guard checking is completely disabled.
  -- Table events, including ~ilc[logic], are ignored, as are many
     other ~ilc[events], including ~ilc[defthm] and ~ilc[comp].
  -- Soundness claims are weakened for any ACL2 session in which raw
     mode was ever entered; ~pl[defttag].
  -- The normal undoing mechanism (~pl[ubt]) is not supported.
  -- Unexpected behavior may occur when you return from raw-mode.
     For example, if you redefine a :logic mode function whose guards
     have not been verified, you will not see the change inside the
     ACL2 loop because there, the raw Common Lisp definition is only
     executed after guards have been verified; ~pl[guards-and-evaluation]
     and ~pl[guard-evaluation-table].
  ~ef[]

  We conclude with some details.

  ~em[Printing results].  The rules for printing results are unchanged for raw
  mode, with one exception.  If the value to be printed would contain any Lisp
  object that is not a legal ACL2 object, then the ~c[print] routine is used
  from the host Lisp, rather than the usual ACL2 printing routine.  The
  following example illustrates the printing used when an illegal ACL2 object
  needs to be printed.  Notice how that ``command conventions'' are observed
  (~pl[ld-post-eval-print]); the ``~c[[Note]'' occurs one space over in the
  second example, and no result is printed in the third example.
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 P>(find-package \"ACL2\")
  [Note:  Printing non-ACL2 result.]
  #<The ACL2 package> 
  ACL2 P>(mv nil (find-package \"ACL2\") state)
   [Note:  Printing non-ACL2 result.]
  #<The ACL2 package> 
  ACL2 P>(mv t (find-package \"ACL2\") state)
  ACL2 P>(mv 3 (find-package \"ACL2\"))
  [Note:  Printing non-ACL2 result.]
  (3 #<The ACL2 package>) 
  ACL2 P>
  ~ev[]
  If you have trouble with large structures being printed out, you might want
  to execute appropriate Common Lisp forms in raw mode, for example,
  ~c[(setq *print-length* 5)] and ~c[(setq *print-level* 5)].

  ~em[Include-book].  The ~il[events] ~ilc[add-include-book-dir] and
  ~ilc[delete-include-book-dir] have been designed to work with raw mode.
  However, if you enter raw mode and then evaluate such forms, then the effects
  of these forms will disappear when you exit raw mode, in which case you can
  expect to see a suitable warning.  Regarding ~em[include-book] itself: it
  should work in raw mode as you might expect, at least if a compiled file or
  expansion file was created when the book was certified; ~pl[certify-book].

  ~em[Packages].  Raw mode disallows the use of ~ilc[defpkg].  If you want to
  create a new package, first exit raw mode with ~c[:set-raw-mode nil];
  you can subsequently re-enter raw mode with ~c[:set-raw-mode t] if you
  wish.~/"

  ":Doc-Section Set-raw-mode

  add arity information for raw mode~/

  Technical note: This macro is a no-op, and is not necessary, when ACL2 is
  built with #-acl2-mv-as-values.

  Users of raw mode (~pl[set-raw-mode]) can use arbitrary raw Lisp functions
  that are not known inside the usual ACL2 loop.  In such cases, ACL2 may not
  know how to display a multiple value returned by ACL2's ~ilc[mv] macro.  The
  following example should make this clear.
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 P>(defun foo (x y) (mv y x))
  FOO
  ACL2 P>(foo 3 4)

  Note: Unable to compute number of values returned by this evaluation
  because function FOO is not known in the ACL2 logical world.  Presumably
  it was defined in raw Lisp or in raw mode.  Returning the first (perhaps
  only) value for calls of FOO.
  4
  ACL2 P>(add-raw-arity foo 2)
   RAW-ARITY-ALIST
  ACL2 P>(foo 3 4)
  (4 3)
  ACL2 P>
  ~ev[]
  The first argument of ~c[add-raw-arity] should be a symbol, representing the
  name of a function, macro, or special form, and the second argument should
  either be a non-negative integer (denoting the number of values returned by
  ACL2) or else the symbol ~c[:LAST], meaning that the number of values
  returned by the call is the number of values returned by the last
  argument.~/

  The current arity assignments can be seen by evaluating
  ~c[(@ raw-arity-alist)].  ~l[remove-raw-arity] for how to undo a call of
  ~c[add-raw-arity].~/"

; Important:  This function returns those triples in wrld3 that are after
; proto-wrld3, in the same order they have in wrld3. See the comment labeled
; "Important" in the definition of constrained-functions.

; As with the function actual-props, we are only interested in triples
; that aren't superseded by *acl2-property-unbound*.  We therefore do
; not copy to our answer any *acl2-property-unbound* triple or any
; chronologically earlier bindings of the relevant symbol and key!
; That is, the list of triples returned by this function contains no
; *acl2-property-unbound* values and makes it appear as though the
; property list was really erased when that value was stored.

; Note therefore that the list of triples returned by this function
; will not indicate when a property bound in proto-wrld3 becomes
; unbound in wrld3.  However, if a property was stored during the
; production of wrld3 and the subsequently in the production of wrld3
; that property was set to *acl2-property-unbound*, then the property
; is gone from the new-trips returned here.

; Warning: The value of this function is sometimes used as though it
; were the 'current-acl2-world!  It is a legal property list world.
; If it gets into a getprop on 'current-acl2-world the answer is
; correct but slow.  Among other things, we use new-trips to compute
; the ancestors of a definition defined within an encapsulate --
; knowing that functions used in those definitions but defined outside
; of the encapsulate (and hence, outside of new-trips) will be treated
; as primitive.  That way we do not explore all the way back to ground
; zero when we are really just looking for the subfunctions defined
; within the encapsulate.

; Note on this recursion: The recursion below is potentially
; disastrously slow.  Imagine that proto-wrld3 is a list of 10,000
; repetitions of the element e.  Imagine that wrld3 is the extension
; produced by adding 1000 more copies of e.  Then the equal below will
; fail the first 1000 times, but it will only fail after confirming
; that the first 10,000 e's in wrld3 are the same as the corresponding
; ones in proto-wrld3, i.e., the equal will do a root-and-branch walk
; through proto-wrld3 1000 times.  When finally the equal succeeds it
; potentially does another root-and-branch exploration of proto-wrld3.
; However, this worst-case scenario is not likely.  More likely, if
; wrld3 is an extension of proto-wrld3 then the first element of wrld3
; differs from that of proto-wrld3 -- because either wrld3 begins with
; a putprop of a new name or a new list of lemmas or some other
; property.  Therefore, most of the time the equal below will fail
; immediately when the two worlds are not equal.  When the two worlds
; are in fact equal, they will be eq, because wrld3 was actually
; constructed by adding triples to proto-wrld3.  So the equal will
; succeed on its initial eq test and avoid a root-and-branch
; exploration.  This analysis is crucial to the practicality of this
; recursive scheme.  Our worlds are so large we simply cannot afford
; root-and-branch explorations.

; In fact, we did see performance issues when seen was kept as a list
; of triples.  So, we have restructured it as an alist, whose values
; are alists, in which triple (key1 key2 . val) is found in the alist

  when non-local ~il[events] won't replay in isolation~/

  Sometimes a ``~ilc[local] incompatibility'' is reported while attempting
  to embed some ~il[events], as in an ~ilc[encapsulate] or ~ilc[include-book].  This is
  generally due to the use of a locally defined name in a non-local
  event or the failure to make a witnessing definition ~ilc[local].~/

  ~ilc[Local] incompatibilities may be detected while trying to execute the
  strictly non-local ~il[events] of an embedding.  For example, ~ilc[encapsulate]
  operates by first executing all the ~il[events] (~ilc[local] and non-local)
  with ~ilc[ld-skip-proofsp] ~c[nil], to confirm that they are all admissible.
  Then it attempts merely to assume the non-local ones to create the
  desired theory, by executing the ~il[events] with ~ilc[ld-skip-proofsp] set to
  ~c[']~ilc[include-book].  Similarly, ~ilc[include-book] assumes the non-local ones,
  with the understanding that a previously successful ~ilc[certify-book] has
  performed the admissiblity check.

  How can a sequence of ~il[events] admitted with ~ilc[ld-skip-proofsp] ~c[nil] fail
  when ~ilc[ld-skip-proofsp] is ~c[']~ilc[include-book]?  The key observation is that
  in the latter case only the non-local ~il[events] are processed.  The
  ~ilc[local] ones are skipped and so the non-local ones must not depend
  upon them.

  Two typical mistakes are suggested by the detection of a ~ilc[local]
  incompatibility: (1) a locally defined function or macro was used in
  a non-~ilc[local] event (and, in the case of ~ilc[encapsulate], was not included
  among the ~il[signature]s) and (2) the witnessing definition of a
  function that was included among the ~il[signature]s of an ~ilc[encapsulate]
  was not made ~ilc[local].

  An example of mistake (1) would be to include among your
  ~il[encapsulate]d ~il[events] both ~c[(local (defun fn ...))] and
  ~c[(defthm lemma (implies (fn ...) ...))].  Observe that ~c[fn] is
  defined locally but a formula involving ~c[fn] is defined
  non-locally.  In this case, either the ~ilc[defthm] should be made
  ~ilc[local] or the ~ilc[defun] should be made non-local.

  An example of mistake (2) would be to include ~c[(fn (x) t)] among your
  ~il[signature]s and then to write ~c[(defun fn (x) ...)] in your ~il[events],
  instead of ~c[(local (defun fn ...))].

  One subtle aspect of ~ilc[encapsulate] is that if you constrain any member
  of a mutually recursive clique you must define the entire clique
  locally and then you must constrain those members of it you want
  axiomatized non-locally.

  Errors due to ~ilc[local] incompatibility should never occur in the
  assumption of a fully certified book.  Certification ensures against
  it.  Therefore, if ~ilc[include-book] reports an incompatibility, we
  assert that earlier in the processing of the ~ilc[include-book] a warning
  was printed advising you that some book was uncertified.  If this is
  not the case ~-[] if ~ilc[include-book] reports an incompatibility and there
  has been no prior warning about lack of certification ~-[] please
  report it to us.

  When a ~ilc[local] incompatibility is detected, we roll-back to the ~il[world]
  in which we started the ~ilc[encapsulate] or ~ilc[include-book].  That is, we
  discard the intermediate ~il[world] created by trying to process the
  ~il[events] skipping proofs.  This is clean, but we realize it is very
  frustrating because the entire sequence of ~il[events] must be processed
  from scratch.  Assuming that the embedded ~il[events] were, once upon a
  time, processed as top-level ~il[command]s (after all, at some point you
  managed to create this sequence of ~il[command]s so that the ~ilc[local] and
  non-local ones together could survive a pass in which proofs were
  done), it stands to reason that we could define a predicate that
  would determine then, before you attempted to embed them, if ~ilc[local]
  incompatibilities exist.  We hope to do that, eventually.

  We conclude with a subtle example of ~ilc[local] incompatibility.  The problem
  is that in order for ~c[foo-type-prescription] to be admitted using the
  specified ~c[:typed-term] ~c[(foo x)], the conclusion ~c[(my-natp (foo x))]
  depends on ~c[my-natp] being a ~il[compound-recognizer].  This is fine on the
  first pass of the ~ilc[encapsulate], during which lemma ~c[my-natp-cr] is
  admitted.  But ~c[my-natp-cr] is skipped on the second pass because it is
  marked ~ilc[local], and this causes ~c[foo-type-prescription] to fail on the
  second pass.

  redo on failure of a ~ilc[progn], ~ilc[encapsulate], or ~ilc[certify-book]~/

  When one submits an ~ilc[encapsulate], ~ilc[progn], or ~ilc[certify-book]
  command and there is a failure, ACL2 restores its logical ~il[world] as
  though the command had not been run.  But sometimes one would like to debug
  the failure by re-executing all sub-events that succeeded up to the point of
  failure, and then re-executing the failed sub-event.  Said differently,
  imagine that the ~il[events] under an ~c[encapsulate], ~c[progn], or
  ~c[certify-book] form were flattened into a list of events that were then
  submitted to ACL2 up to the point of failure.  This would put us in the state
  in which the original failed event had failed, so we could now replay that
  failed event and try modifying it, or first proving additional events, in
  order to get it admitted.

  ~c[Redo-flat] is provided for this purpose.  Consider the following (rather
  nonsensical) example, in which the ~ilc[defun] of ~c[f3] fails (the body is
  ~c[y] but the formal parameter list is ~c[(x)]).
  ~bv[]
  (encapsulate
   ()
   (defun f1 (x) x)
   (encapsulate ()
                (local (defthm hack (equal (car (cons x y)) x))))
   (encapsulate ()
                (local (defthm hack (equal (+ x y) (+ y x)))))
   (encapsulate ()
                (make-event '(defun f2 (x) x))
                (progn (defthm foo (equal x x) :rule-classes nil)
                       (defun f3 (x) y)))
   (defun f4 (x) x)
   (defun f5 (x) y))
  ~ev[]
  After this attempt fails, you can evaluate the following form.
  ~bv[]
  (redo-flat)
  ~ev[]
  This will first lay down a ~ilc[deflabel] event, ~c[(deflabel r)], so that
  you can eventually remove your debugging work with ~c[(:ubt! r)].  Then the
  successful sub-events that preceded the failure will be executed with proofs
  skipped (so that this execution is fast).  Then, the failed event will be
  executed.  Finally, a ~c[:]~ilc[pbt] command is executed so that you can see
  a summary of the events that executed successfully.

  You can eliminate some of the steps above by supplying keyword values, as
  follows.
  ~bv[]
  (redo-flat
   :succ  succ ; Skip the successful sub-events if val is nil.
   :fail  fail ; Skip the failed sub-event if val is nil.
   :label lab  ; Skip deflabel if lab or succ is nil, else use (deflabel lab).
   :pbt   val  ; Skip the final :pbt if val, lab, or succ is nil.
   )
  ~ev[]
  Also, you can avoid skipping proofs for the successful sub-events by
  supplying keyword ~c[:succ-ld-skip-proofsp] with a valid value for
  ~c[ld-skip-proofsp]; ~pl[ld-skip-proofsp].  For example, you might want to
  execute ~c[(redo-flat :succ-ld-skip-proofsp nil)] if you use the
  ~c[must-fail] utility from community book ~c[make-event/eval.lisp], since
  for example ~c[(must-fail (thm (equal x y)))] normally succeeds but would
  cause an error if proofs are skipped.

  If you prefer only to see the successful and failed sub-events, without any
  events being re-executed, you may evaluate the following form instead.
  ~bv[]
  (redo-flat :show t)
  ~ev[]
  For the example above, this command produces the following output.
  ~bv[]

  List of events preceding the failure:

  ((DEFUN F1 (X) X)
   (ENCAPSULATE NIL
                (LOCAL (DEFTHM HACK (EQUAL (CAR (CONS X Y)) X))))
   (ENCAPSULATE NIL
                (LOCAL (DEFTHM HACK (EQUAL (+ X Y) (+ Y X)))))
   (MAKE-EVENT '(DEFUN F2 (X) X))
   (DEFTHM FOO (EQUAL X X)
           :RULE-CLASSES NIL))

  Failed event:

  (DEFUN F3 (X) Y)
  ACL2 !>
  ~ev[]

  ~c[Redo-flat] uses a scheme that should not cause spurious name conflicts for
  ~ilc[local] events.  Above, it is mentioned that events are ``flattened'';
  now we clarify this notion.  Each sub-event that succeeds and is an
  ~ilc[encapsulate] or ~ilc[progn] is left intact.  Only such events that fail
  are replaced by their component events.  Thus, in the example above, there is
  no conflict between the two ~ilc[local] sub-events named ``~c[hack],''
  because these are contained in successful ~c[encapsulate] sub-events, which
  are therefore not flattened.  The ~ilc[progn] and two ~ilc[encapsulate]
  events surrounding the definition of ~c[f3] are, however, flattened, because
  that definition failed to be admitted.

  Normally, ~c[redo-flat] will have the desired effect even if you interrupted
  a proof (with control-c).  However, ~c[redo-flat] will not produce the
  desired result after an interrupt if you have enabled the debugger using
  ~c[(set-debugger-enable t)],~/~/"

; Warning: This function uses set-w and hence may only be called within a
; revert-world-on-error.  See the statement of policy in set-w.

; This function is the heart of the second pass of encapsulate, include-book,
; and certify-book.  Caller is in fact one of the symbols 'encapsulate-pass-1,
; 'encapsulate-pass-2, 'include-book, 'certify-book, 'defstobj, or
; 'defabsstobj.  Note: There is no function encapsulate-pass-1, but it is still
; a ``caller.''

; Acl2-defaults-table is either a legal alist value for acl2-defaults-table or
; else is :do-not-install.  If the former, then that alist is installed as the
; acl2-defaults-table (if it is not already there) after executing the events
; in ev-lst.

; The name ee-entry stands for ``embedded-event-lst'' entry.  It is consed onto
; the embedded-event-lst for the duration of the processing of ev-lst.  The
; length of that list indicates how deep these evs are.  For example, if the
; embedded-event-lst is

;   ((defstobj ...)
;    (encapsulate nil) 
;    (include-book ...)
;    (encapsulate ((p (x y) (nil nil) (nil)) ...)))

; then the ev-lst is the ``body'' of a defstobj, which occurs in the body of an
; encapsulate, which is in an include-book, which is in an encapsulate.

; The shape of an ee-entry is entirely up to the callers and the customers of
; the embedded-event-lst, with three exceptions:
; (a) the ee-entry must always be a consp;
; (b) if the car of the ee-entry is 'encapsulate then the cadr is the internal
;     form signatures of the functions being constrained; and
; (c) if the car of the ee-entry is 'include-book then the cadr is the
;     full-book-name.
; We refer to the signatures in (b) as insigs below and think of insigs as nil
; for all ee-entries other than encapsulates.

; Ev-lst is the list of alleged events.  Pkg is the value we should use for
; current-package while we are processing the events.  This affects how forms
; are prettyprinted.  It also affects how the prompt looks.

; We first extend the current world of state by insigs (if caller is
; 'encapsulate-pass-2) and extend the embedded event list by ee-entry.  We then
; extend further by doing each of events in ev-lst while ld-skip-proofsp is set
; to skip-proofsp, checking that they are indeed embedded-event-forms.  If that
; succeeds, we restore embedded-event-lst, install the world, and return.

; If caller is not 'encapsulate-pass-2, then the return value includes an
; expansion-alist that records the result of expanding away every make-event
; call encountered in the course of processing the given ev-lst.  Each pair (n
; . ev) in expansion-alist asserts that ev is the result of expanding away
; every make-event call during evaluation of the nth member of ev-lst (starting
; with index for the initial member of ev-lst), though if no such expansion
; took place then this pair is omitted.  If caller is 'certify-book, then the
; return value is the cons of this expansion-alist onto either the initial
; known-package-alist, if that has not changed, or else onto the index of the
; first event that changed the known-package-alist (where the initial
; in-package event has index 0).

; If caller is 'encapsulate-pass-2, then since the final world is in STATE, we
; use the value component of the non-erroneous return triple to return the
; world extended by the signatures (and the incremented depth).  That world,
; called proto-wrld3 in the encapsulate essay and below, is useful only for
; computing (via difference) the names introduced by the embedded events.  We
; still need the expansion-alist described in the preceding paragraph, so the
; value returned for 'encapsulate-pass-2 is the cons of that expansion-alist
; with this proto-wrld3.

; If an error is caused by the attempt to embed the events, we print a warning
; message explaining and pass the error up.

; The world names used here are consistent with the encapsulate essay.

; We wish to know if is there an event-tuple in wrld that has event-form as its
; form.  We do know that event-form is an encapsulate with the given two
; arguments.  We don't know if event-form will execute without error.  But
; suppose we could find a name among signatures and ev-lst that is guaranteed
; to be created if event-form were successful.  Then if that name is new, we
; know we won't find event-form in wrld and needn't bother looking.  If the
; name is old and was introduced by a corresponding encapsulate (in the sense
; that the signatures agree and each form of the new encapsulate either equals
; the corresponding form of the old encapsulate or else, roughly speaking, does
; so before expansion of the old form -- see corresponding-encaps), then the
; event is redundant.  Otherwise, if this correspondence test fails or if we
; can't even find a name -- e.g., because signatures is nil and all the events
; in ev-lst are user macros -- then we suffer the search through wrld.  How bad
; is this?  We expect most encapsulates to have a readily recognized name among
; their new args and most encapsulates are not redundant, so we think most of
; the time, we'll find a name and it will be new.

; If we find that the current encapsulate is redundant, then we return t unless
; the earlier corresponding encapsulate is not equal to it, in which case we
; return that earlier encapsulate, which is stored in expanded form.  See also
; the Essay on Make-event.  Otherwise we return nil.

; Important Note:  Don't change the formals of this function without reading

; The Encapsulate Essay

; The motivation behind this event is to permit one to extend the theory by
; introducing function symbols, and theorems that describe their properties,
; without completely tying down the functions or including all of the lemmas
; and other hacks necessary to lead the system to the proofs.  Thus, this
; mechanism replaces the CONSTRAIN event of Nqthm.  It also offers one way of
; getting some name control, comparable to scopes.  However, it is better than
; just name control because the "hidden" rules are not just apparently hidden,
; they simply don't exist.

; Encapsulate takes two main arguments.  The first is a list of
; "signatures" that describe the function symbols to be hidden.  By
; signature we mean the formals, stobjs-in and stobjs-out of the
; function symbol.  The second is a list of events to execute.  Some
; of these events are tagged as "local" events and the others are not.
; Technically, each element of ev-lst is either an "event form" or
; else an s-expression of the form (LOCAL ev), where ev is an "event
; form."  The events of the second form are the local events.
; Informally, the local events are present only so that we can justify
; (i.e., successfully prove) the non-local events.  The local events
; are not visible in the final world constructed by an encapsulation.

; Suppose we execute an encapsulation starting with ld-skip-proofsp nil in
; wrld1.  We will actually make two passes through the list of events.  The
; first pass will execute each event, proving things, whether it is local or
; not.  This will produce wrld2.  In wrld2, we check that every function symbol
; in signatures is defined and has the signature alleged.  Then we back up to
; wrld1, declare the hidden functions with the appropriate signatures
; (producing what we call proto-wrld3) and replay only the non-local events.
; (Note: if redefinitions are allowed and are being handled by query, the user
; will be presented with two queries for each redefining non-local event.
; There is no assurance that he answers the same way both times and different
; worlds may result.  C'est la vie avec redefinitions.)  During this replay we
; skip proofs.  Having constructed that world we then collect all of the
; theorems that mention any of the newly-introduced functions and consider the
; resulting list as the constraint for all those functions.  (This is a
; departure from an earlier, unsound implementation, in which we only collected
; theorems mentioning the functions declared in the signature.)  However, we
; "optimize" by constructing this list of theorems using only those
; newly-introduced functions that have as an ancestor at least one function
; declared in the signature.  In particular, we do not introduce any
; constraints if the signature is empty, which is reasonable since in that
; case, we may view the encapsulate event the same as we view a book.  At any
; rate, the world we obtain by noting this constraint on the appropriate
; functions is called wrld3, and it is the world produced by a successful
; encapsulation.  By putting enough checks on the kinds of events executed we
; can guarantee that the formulas assumed to create wrld3 from wrld1 are
; theorems that were proved about defined functions in wrld2.

; This is a non-trivial claim and will be the focus of much of our discussion
; below.  This discussion could be eliminated if the second pass consisted of
; merely adding to wrld1 the formulas of the exported names, obtained from
; wrld2.  We do not do that because we want to be able to execute an
; encapsulation quickly if we process one while skipping proofs.  That is,
; suppose the user has produced a script of some session, including some
; encapsulations, and the whole thing has been processed with ld-skip-proofsp
; nil, once upon a time.  Now the user wants to assume that script and and
; continue -- i.e., he is loading a "book".

; Suppose we hit the encapsulation when skipping proofs.  Suppose we are
; again in wrld1 (i.e., processing the previous events of this script
; while skipping proofs has inductively left us in exactly the same
; state as when we did them with proofs).  We are given the event list
; and the signatures.  We want to do here exactly what we did in the
; second pass of the original proving execution of this encapsulate.
; Perhaps more informatively put, we want to do in the second pass of
; the proving execution exactly what we do here -- i.e., the relative
; paucity of information available here (we only have wrld1 and not
; wrld2) dictates how we must handle pass two back there.  Remember, our
; goal is to ensure that the final world we create, wrld3, is absolutely
; identical to that created above.

; Our main problem is that the event list is in untranslated form.
; Two questions arise.

; (1) If we skip an event because it is tagged LOCAL, how will we know
; we can execute (or even translate) the subsequent events without
; error?  For example, suppose one of the events skipped is the
; defmacro of deflemma, and then we see a (deflemma &).  We will have
; to make sure this doesn't happen.  The key here is that we know that
; the second pass of the proving execution of this encapsulate did
; whatever we're doing and it didn't cause an error.  But this is an
; important point about the proving execution of an encapsulate: even
; though we make a lot of checks before the first pass, it is possible
; for the second pass to fail.  When that happens, we'll revert back
; to wrld1 for sanity.  This is unfortunate because it means the user
; will have to suffer through the re-execution of his event list
; before seeing if he has fixed the last error.  We should eventually
; provide some sort of trial encapsulation mechanism so the user can
; see if he's got his signatures and exports correctly configured.

; (2) How do we know that the formulas generated during the second
; pass are exactly the same as those generated during the first pass?
; For example, one of the events might be:

; (if (ld-skip-proofsp state)
;     (defun foo () 3)
;     (defun foo () 2))

; In this case, (foo) would be 2 in wrld2 but 3 in wrld3.

; The key to the entire story is that we insist that the event list
; consist of certain kinds of events.  For lack of a better name, we
; call these "embedded event forms".  Not everything the user might
; want to type in an interactive ACL2 session is an embedded event
; form!  Roughly speaking, an event form translates to a PROGN of
; "primitive events", where the primitive events are appropriate calls
; of such user-level functions as defun and defthm.  By "appropriate"
; we mean STATE only appears where specified by the stobjs-in for each
; event.  The other arguments, e.g., the name of a defthm, must be
; occupied by state free terms -- well, almost.  We allow uses of w so
; that the user can compute things like gensyms wrt the world.  In a
; rough analogy with Lisp, the events are those kinds of commands that
; are treated specially when they are seen at the top-level of a file
; to be compiled.

; Events have the property that while they take state as an argument
; and change it, their changes to the world are a function only of the
; world (and their other arguments).  Because of this property, we
; know that if s1 and s1' are states containing the same world, and s2
; and s2' are the states obtained by executing an event on the two
; initial states, respectively, then the worlds of s2 and s2' are
; equal.

; Thus ends the encapsulate essay.

; Now we develop the book mechanism, which shares a lot with what
; we've just done.  In the discussion that follows, Unix is a
; trademark of Bell Laboratories.

; First, a broad question:  how much security are we trying to provide?
; After all, one could always fake a .cert file, say by calling checksum
; onesself.  Our claim is simply that we only fully "bless" certification runs,
; from scratch, of entire collections of books, without intervention.  Thus,
; there is no soundness problem with using (include-book "hd:ab.lisp") in a
; book certified in a Unix file system and having it mean something completely
; different on the Macintosh.  Presumably the attempt to certify this
; collection on the Macintosh would simply fail.

; How portable do we intend book names to be?  Suppose that one has a
; collection of books, some of which include-book some of the others, where all
; of these include-books use relative path names.  Can we set things up so that
; if one copies all of these .lisp and .cert files to another file system,
; preserving the hierarchical directory relationship, then we can guarantee
; that this collection of books is certifiable (modulo resource limitations)?
; The answer is yes: We use Unix-style pathnames within ACL2.  See :doc
; pathname, and see the Essay on Pathnames in interface-raw.lisp.  (Before
; Version_2.5 we also supported a notion of structured pathnames, similar to
; the "structured directories" concept in CLtL2.  However, the CLtL2 notion was
; just for directories, not file names, and we "deprecated" structured
; pathnames by deleting their documentation around Version_2.5.  We continued
; to support structured pathnames through Version_2.8 for backwards
; compatibility, but no longer.)

; Note.  It is important that regardless of what initial information we store
; in the state that is based on the surrounding operating system, this
; information not be observable in the logical theory.  For example, it would
; really be unfortunate if we did something like:

;  (defconst *directory-separator*
;    #+apple #\:
;    #-apple #\/)

; because then we could certify a book in one ACL2 that contains a theorem
; (equal *directory-separator* #\/), and include this book in another world
; where that theorem fails, thus deriving a contradiction.  In fact, we make
; the operating-system part of the state (as a world global), and figure
; everything else out about book names using that information.

  files of ACL2 event forms~/

  This ~il[documentation] topic is about ACL2 input files.  However, there are
  two traditional (paper) books published about ACL2: a textbook and a case
  studies book.  Further information on those two paper books is available by
  following links from the ACL2 home page,
  ~url[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/].

  A ``book'' is a file of ACL2 ~il[events] that have been certified as
  admissible.  Using ~ilc[include-book] you can construct a new logical
  ~il[world] by assuming the ~il[events] in any number of mutually compatible
  books.  Relevant documented topics are listed below.  Following this list
  is a ``guided tour'' through the topics.
  ~terminal[You may start the guided tour by typing :more.]

  You can contribute books to the ACL2 community and obtain updates inbetween
  ACL2 releases by visiting the ~c[acl2-books] project web page,
  ~url[http://acl2-books.googlecode.com/].  Also ~pl[community-books].~/

  ~em[Introduction.]

  A ``book'' is a file of ACL2 forms.  Books are prepared entirely by
  the user of the system, i.e., they are ``source'' files not
  ``object'' files.  Some of the forms in a book are marked ~ilc[local]
  and the others are considered ``non-local.''

  ~ilc[Include-book] lets you load a book into any ACL2 ~il[world].  If
  completed without error, the inclusion of a book extends the logic
  of the host ~il[world] by the addition of just the non-local ~il[events] in
  the book.  You may extend the ~il[world] by successively including a
  variety of books to obtain the desired collection of definitions and
  rules.  Unless name conflicts occur (which are detected and
  signalled) inclusion of a book is consistency preserving provided
  the book itself is consistent as discussed later.  However,
  ~ilc[include-book] merely assumes the validity of the ~il[events] in a book;
  if you include a book that contains an inconsistency (e.g., an
  inadmissible definition) then the resulting theory is inconsistent.

  It is possible to ``certify'' a book, with ~ilc[certify-book],
  guaranteeing that the error-free inclusion of the certified forms
  will produce a consistent extension of a consistent logic.
  Certification processes both the ~ilc[local] and non-local forms, so
  you can mark as ~ilc[local] those ~il[events] you need for certification
  that you want to hide from users of the book (e.g., hacks, crocks,
  and kludges on the way to a good set of ~c[:]~ilc[rewrite] rules).
  Certification can also ``compile'' a book, thereby speeding up the
  execution of the functions defined within it.  The desire to compile
  books is largely responsible for the restrictions we put on the
  forms allowed in books.

  Extensive ~il[documentation] is available on the various aspects of
  books.  We recommend that you read it all before using books.  It
  has been written so as to make sense when read in a certain linear
  sequence, called the ``guided tour'', though in general you may
  browse through it randomly.  If you are on the guided tour, you
  should next read the ~il[documentation] on book-example
  (~pl[book-example]~terminal[ and use :more to read through it]).~/

  the true absolute filename, with soft links resolved~/

  For the name ~c[fname] of a file, the form
  ~c[(Canonical-pathname fname nil state)] evaluates to a Unix-style absolute
  filename representing the same file as ~c[fname], but generally without any
  use of soft links in the name.  (Below, we explain the qualifier
  ``generally''.)  If however the file indicated by ~c[fname] does not exist,
  ~c[(canonical-pathname fname nil state)] is ~c[nil].  Thus,
  ~c[canonical-pathname] can be used as one would use the raw Lisp function
  ~c[probe-file].

  The specification of ~c[(Canonical-pathname fname dir-p state)] when
  ~c[dir-p] is not ~c[nil] is simlar, except that if the specified file exists
  but is not a directory, then the result is ~c[nil].~/

  The function ~c[canonical-pathname] has a guard of ~c[t], though the second
  argument must be the ACL2 ~ilc[state].  This function is introduced with the
  following properties.
  ~bv[]
  (defthm canonical-pathname-is-idempotent
    (equal (canonical-pathname (canonical-pathname x dir-p state) dir-p state)
           (canonical-pathname x dir-p state)))

        (stringp (canonical-pathname x dir-p state)))
    :rule-classes :type-prescription)
  ~ev[]

  We use the qualifier ``generally'', above, because there is no guarantee that
  the filename will be canonical without soft links, though we expect this to
  be true in practice.  ACL2 attempts to compute the desired result and then
  checks that the input and result have the same Common Lisp ``~c[truename]''.
  This check is expected to succeed, but if it fails then the input string is
  returned unchanged, and to be conservative, the value returned is ~c[nil] in
  this case if ~c[dir-p] is true.")

  connected book directory string~/

  Example:
  ACL2 !>:cbd
  \"/usr/home/smith/\"
  ~ev[]
  The connected book directory is a nonempty string that specifies a
  directory as an absolute pathname.  (~l[pathname] for a
  discussion of file naming conventions.)  When ~ilc[include-book] is given
  a relative book name it elaborates it into a full book name,
  essentially by appending the connected book directory string to the
  left and ~c[\".lisp\"] to the right.  (For details,
  ~pl[book-name] and also ~pl[full-book-name].)  Furthermore,
  ~ilc[include-book] temporarily sets the connected book directory to the
  directory string of the resulting full book name so that references
  to inferior ~il[books] in the same directory may omit the directory.
  ~l[set-cbd] for how to set the connected book directory string.~/
  ~bv[]
  General Form:
  (cbd)
  ~ev[]
  This is a macro that expands into a term involving the single free
  variable ~ilc[state].  It returns the connected book directory string.

  The connected book directory (henceforth called the ``~c[cbd]'') is
  used by ~ilc[include-book] to elaborate the supplied book name into a
  full book name (~pl[full-book-name]).  For example, if the ~c[cbd]
  is ~c[\"/usr/home/smith/\"] then the elaboration of the ~il[book-name]
  ~c[\"project/task-1/arith\"] (to the ~c[\".lisp\"] extension) is
  ~c[\"/usr/home/smith/project/task-1/arith.lisp\"].  That
  ~il[full-book-name] is what ~il[include-book] opens to read the
  source text for the book.

  The ~c[cbd] may be changed using ~ilc[set-cbd] (~pl[set-cbd]).
  Furthermore, during the processing of the ~il[events] in a book,
  ~ilc[include-book] sets the ~c[cbd] to be the directory string of the
  ~il[full-book-name] of the book.  Thus, if the ~c[cbd] is
  ~c[\"/usr/home/smith/\"] then during the processing of ~il[events] by
  ~bv[]
  (include-book \"project/task-1/arith\")
  ~ev[]
  the ~c[cbd] will be set to ~c[\"/usr/home/smith/project/task-1/\"].
  Note that if ~c[\"arith\"] recursively includes a subbook, say
  ~c[\"naturals\"], that resides on the same directory, the
  ~ilc[include-book] event for it may omit the specification of that
  directory.  For example, ~c[\"arith\"] might contain the event
  ~bv[]
    (include-book \"naturals\").
  ~ev[]
  In general, suppose we have a superior book and several inferior
  ~il[books] which are included by ~il[events] in the superior book.  Any
  inferior book residing on the same directory as the superior book
  may be referenced in the superior without specification of the
  directory.

  We call this a ``relative'' as opposed to ``absolute'' naming.  The
  use of relative naming is preferred because it permits ~il[books]
  (and their accompanying inferiors) to be moved between directories
  while maintaining their ~il[certificate]s and utility.  Certified
  ~il[books] that reference inferiors by absolute file names are unusable
  (and rendered uncertified) if the inferiors are moved to new
  directories.

  ~em[Technical Note and a Challenge to Users:]

  After elaborating the book name to a full book name, ~ilc[include-book]
  opens a channel to the file to process the ~il[events] in it.  In some
  host Common Lisps, the actual file opened depends upon a notion of
  ``connected directory'' similar to our connected book directory.
  Our intention in always elaborating book names into absolute
  filename strings (~pl[pathname] for terminology) is to
  circumvent the sensitivity to the connected directory.  But we may
  have insufficient control over this since the ultimate file naming
  conventions are determined by the host operating system rather than
  Common Lisp (though, we do check that the operating system
  ``appears'' to be one that we ``know'' about).  Here is a question,
  which we'll pose assuming that we have an operating system that
  calls itself ``Unix.''  Suppose we have a file name, filename, that
  begins with a slash, e.g., ~c[\"/usr/home/smith/...\"].  Consider two
  successive invocations of CLTL's
  ~bv[]
  (open filename :direction :input)
  ~ev[]
  separated only by a change to the operating system's notion of
  connected directory.  Must these two invocations produce streams to
  the same file?  A candidate string might be something like
  ~c[\"/usr/home/smith/*/usr/local/src/foo.lisp\"] which includes some
  operating system-specific special character to mean ``here insert
  the connected directory'' or, more generally, ``here make the name
  dependent on some non-ACL2 aspect of the host's state.''  If such
  ``tricky'' name strings beginning with a slash exist, then we have
  failed to isolate ACL2 adequately from the operating system's file
  naming conventions.  Once upon a time, ACL2 did not insist that the
  ~c[cbd] begin with a slash and that allowed the string
  ~c[\"foo.lisp\"] to be tricky because if one were connected to
  ~c[\"/usr/home/smith/\"] then with the empty ~c[cbd] ~c[\"foo.lisp\"]
  is a full book name that names the same file as
  ~c[\"/usr/home/smith/foo.lisp\"].  If the actual file one reads is
  determined by the operating system's state then it is possible for
  ACL2 to have two distinct ``full book names'' for the same file, the
  ``real'' name and the ``tricky'' name.  This can cause ACL2 to
  include the same book twice, not recognizing the second one as
  redundant."

; Defpkg-items is a list of "defpkg items" each of the form (list name imports
; body doc book-path) representing a list of package definitions.  We return a
; list of defpkg events, corresponding to some of these defpkg items, that can
; be executed in a world whose known-package-alist is earlier-kpa.  The primary
; reason a defpkg is in the returned list is that its package is not in
; base-kpa (not even hidden).  The second reason is that we need to define a
; package P1 not already in earlier-kpa if we add another package P2 whose
; import list contains a symbol in package P1; we close under this process.

; This function is called at the end of the include-book phase of certify-book.
; In that case, base-kpa is the known-package-alist at that point, earlier-kpa
; is the known-package-alist of the certification world, and defpkg-items
; contains an item for each name of a package in the known-package-alist at the
; end of the earlier, admissibility pass of certify-book that was not defined
; in the certification world.  To illustrate the "second reason" above, let us
; suppose that the book being certified contains forms (include-book "book1")
; and (local (include-book "book2")), where book1 defines (defpkg "PKG1" ...)
; and book2 defines (defpkg "PKG2" '(PKG1::SYM)).  Then we want to add the
; definition of "PKG2" to the portcullis, but in order to do so, we need to add
; the definition of "PKG1" as well, even though it will eventually be included
; by way of book1.  And, we need to be sure to add the defpkg of "PKG1" before
; that of "PKG2".

; This function is also called on behalf of puff-fn1, where defpkg-items
; corresponds to the packages in known-package-alist in the world at completion
; of the command about to be puffed, and base-kpa and earlier-kpa correspond to
; the known-package-alist just before that command.  In that case there is no
; need for the "second reason" above, but for simplicity we call this same
; function.

; A naive implementation would provide a portcullis for "user" that contains
; (include-book "prelude").  But there is no clue as to the directory on which
; "prelude" resides.  Note that "prelude" does not represent an absolute
; pathname.  If it did represent an absolute pathname, then it would have to be
; the full book name because parse-book-name returns x when x represents an
; absolute pathname.

; We deal with the issue above by allowing relative pathnames for include-book
; commands in the certification world, but modifying them, when necessary, to
; be appropriate absolute pathnames.  We say "when necessary" because
; include-book-fn sets the cbd to the directory of the book, so if the relative
; pathname resolves against that cbd to be the correct full book name, then no
; modification is necessary.

; This function takes the original cmds and a list of embedded event forms.
; We return a list of commands that is guaranteed to be free of include-books
; of relative pathnames, that nevertheless is equivalent to the original cmds
; from the standpoint of subsequent embedded events.  (Or, we return an error,
; but in fact we believe that that will not happen.)

; As mentioned at the outset above, this function also adds defpkg events.  We
; trust that the portcullis is a legal sequence of commands (actually, events),
; so the only point is to added hidden packages as per the Essay on Hidden
; Packages.

; Call this function using the same names parameter as that used when verifying
; that cmds is a list of embedded event forms.

; 'include-book for this operation because these commands have all been
; successfully carried out in a boot strap world.  If this doesn't cause an
; error, then we read the optional :expansion-alist, the pre- and post- check

; Light-chkp is t when we are content to avoid rigorous checks on the
; certificate, say because we are simply interested in some information that
; need not be fully trusted.

; Unless we are told to ignore the pre-alist, we check that it is a subset of
; the current include-book-alist.  Failure of this check may lead either to an
; error or to the assumption that the book is uncertified, according to the
; suspect-book-action-alist.  If we don't cause an error we return either the
; certificate object, which is a cert-obj record, or else we return nil,

; it.  We now read the rest of file2 and either open the portcullis (skipping
; evaluation if evalp is nil) and return a cert-obj record or nil if we are
; assuming the book, or we cause an error.

; The code below is tedious and we here document it.  The first thing we look
; for is the ACL2 Version number printed immediately after the in-package.
; This function is made more complicated by four facts.  We do not know for
; sure that the certificate file is well-formed in any version.  Also, we do
; not know whether include-book-er causes an error or just prints a warning
; (because that is determined by suspect-book-action-alist and the values of
; the state globals defaxioms-okp-cert and skip-proofs-okp-cert).  Suppose we
; read a purported version string, val, that does not match the current
; acl2-version.  Then we cause an include-book-er which may or may not signal
; an error.  If it does not then we are to assume the uncertified book so we
; must proceed with the certificate check as though the version were ok.
; Basically this means we want to call chk-raise-portcullis, but we must first
; make sure we've read to the beginning of the portcullis.  If val looks like
; an ACL2 Version string, then this file is probably a well-formed Version 1.9+
; file and we must read the :BEGIN-PORTCULLIS-CMDS before proceeding.
; Otherwise, this isn't well-formed and we cause an error.

; This function writes out, and returns, a certificate file.  We first give
; that file a temporary name.  Our original motivation was the expectation that
; afterwards, compilation is performed and then the certificate file is renamed
; to its suitable .cert name.  This way, we expect that that the compiled file
; will have a write date that is later than (or at least, not earlier than) the
; write date of the certificate file; yet, we can be assured that "make"
; targets that depend on the certificate file's existence will be able to rely
; implicitly on the compiled file's existence as well.  After Version_4.3 we
; arranged that even when not compiling we use a temporary file, so that (we
; hope) once the .cert file exists, it has all of its contents.

; We assume file satisfies chk-book-name.  The portcullis is a pair (cmds
; . pre-alist), where cmds is the list of portcullis commands that created the
; world in which the certification was done, and pre-alist is the
; include-book-alist just before certification was done.  Post-alist1 is the
; include-book-alist after proving the events in file and post-alist2 is the
; include-book-alist after just including the events in file.  If they are
; different it is because the book included some subbooks within LOCAL forms
; and those subbooks did not get loaded for post-alist2.

; For efficiency, we pass in a check-sum, chk-sum, already computed for:
; (make cert-obj
;       :cmds (car portcullis)
;       :pre-alist (cdr portcullis)
;       :post-alist post-alist3
;       :expansion-alist expansion-alist)

; To verify that a subsequent inclusion is ok, we really only need post-alist2.
; That is, if the book included some LOCAL subbook then it is not necessary
; that that subbook even exist when we include the main book.  On the other
; hand, we trace calls of skip-proofs using the call of
; skipped-proofsp-in-post-alist in include-book-fn, which requires
; consideration of LOCALly included books; and besides, it might be useful to
; know what version of the subbook we used during certification, although the
; code at the moment makes no use of that.  So we massage post-alist1 so that
; any subbook in it that is not in post-alist2 is marked LOCAL.  Thus,
; post-alist3, below, will be of the form

; ((full1 user1 familiar1 cert-annotations1 . chk-sum1)
;  ...
;  (LOCAL (fulli useri familiari cert-annotationsi . chk-sumi))
;  ...
;  (fullk userk familiark cert-annotationsk . chk-sumk))

; and thus is not really an include-book-alist.  By deleting the LOCAL
; elements from it we obtain post-alist2.

; We write a certificate file for file.  The certificate file has the
; following form:

; (in-package "ACL2")
; "ACL2 Version x.y"
; :BEGIN-PORTCULLIS-CMDS  ; this is here just to let us check that the file
; cmd1                    ; is not a normal list of events.
; ...
; cmdk
; :END-PORTCULLIS-CMDS
; pre-alist
; post-alist3
; chk-sum

; where chk-sum is the check sum of ((cmds . pre-alist) . post-alist3).

; The reason the portcullis commands are written this way, rather than
; as a single object, is that we can't read them all at once since
; they may contain DEFPKGs.  We have to read and eval the cmdi
; individually.

; Optionally, create .cert.final file as well; see comment below.

; For Debian release:

; Warning: The following mechanism should work well in most cases, but it is
; not guaranteed to be sound.  For example, function fix-path will ignore
; macros that expand (non-trivially) to event forms that should be handled by
; fix-path.  With some effort, we could use macroexpand to deal with this
; issue, by storing the macroexpanded forms in the portcullis in such cases.
; Even then, however, there would be problems with progn! (albeit only with
; active trust tags), since we can't really control what's in such forms.  And
; we would have to be careful to handle make-event forms properly, if we wanted
; an ironclad correctness guarantee for this mechanism.  End of Warning.

; A .cert.final file is created if state globals 'old-certification-dir and
; 'new-certification-dir are set to strings.  For example, in your
; ACL2 customization file you might put:

; (f-put-global 'old-certification-dir "/fix/debian/acl2/acl2-xx/books" state)
; (f-put-global 'new-certification-dir "/usr/share/acl2-xx/books" state)

; This will create a second certificate file, .cert.final (in addition to the
; .cert file), with post-alist3 fixed up so that for each string with prefix
; equal to the value of state global 'old-certification-dir, that prefix is
; replaced by the value of state global 'new-certification-dir.  The books in
; defpkg forms of the portcullis are similarly fixed as well.

; Warning: This .cert.final process works as described above, without
; modification in the case that we are doing provisional certification.  If we
; want to use this process with provisional certification, some additional work

; Essay on Guard Checking

; We bind the state global variable guard-checking-on to nil in certify-book-fn
; and in include-book-fn (using state-global-let*), and also in
; pc-single-step-primitive.  We bind guard-checking-on to t in prove,
; translate-in-theory-hint, and value-triple.  We do not bind guard-checking-on
; in defconst-fn.  Here we explain these decisions.

; We prefer to bind guard-checking-on to a predetermined fixed value when
; certifying or including books.  Why?  Book certification is a logical act.
; :Set-guard-checking is intended to be extra-logical, giving the user control
; over evaluation in the interactive loop, and hence we do not want it to
; affect how books are processed, either during certification or during
; inclusion.

; So the question now is whether to bind guard-checking-on to t or to nil for
; book certification and for book inclusion.  (We reject :none and :all because
; they can be too inefficient.)

; We want it to be the case that if a book is certified, then subsequently it
; can be included.  In particular, it would be unfortunate if certification is
; done in an environment with guard checking off, and then later we get a guard
; violation when including the book with guard checking on.  So if we bind
; guard-checking-on to nil in certify-book, then we should also bind it to nil
; in include-book.

; We argue now for binding guard-checking-on to nil in certify-book-fn (and
; hence, as argued above, in include-book-fn as well).  Note that we already
; allow book certification without requiring guard verification, which drives
; home the position that guards are extra-logical.  Thus, a high-level argument
; for binding guard-checking-on to nil during certification is that if we bind
; instead to t, then that position is diluted.  Now we give a more practical
; argument for binding guard-checking-on to nil during certification.  Suppose
; someone writes a macro with a guard, where that guard enforces some
; intention.  Do we want to enforce that guard, and when?  We already have
; safe-mode to enforce the guard as necessary for Common Lisp.  If a user
; executes :set-guard-checking nil in the interactive loop, then function
; guards are not checked, and thus it is reasonable not to check macro guards
; either.  Now suppose the same user attempts to certify a book that contains a
; top-level guard-violating macro call.  What a rude surprise it would be if
; certification fails due to a guard violation during expansion of that macro
; call, when the interactive evaluation of that same call had just succeeded!
; (One might argue that it is a sophisticated act to turn off guard checking in
; the interactive loop, hence a user who does that should be able to handle
; that rude surprise.  But that argument seems weak; even a beginner could find
; out how to turn off guard checking after seeing a guard violation.)

; We have argued for turning off guard checking during certify-book.  But a
; concern remains.  Suppose one user has written a macro with a guard, and now
; suppose a second user creates a book containing a top-level call of that
; macro with a guard violation.  Safe-mode will catch any Common Lisp guard
; violation.  But the macro writer may have attached the guard in order to
; enforce some intention that is not related to Common Lisp.  In the case of
; functions, one can ensure one's compliance with existing guards by verifying
; all guards, for example with (set-verify-guards-eagerness 2) at the top of
; the file.  A similar "complete guard checking" mechanism could enforce one's
; compliance with macro guards as well, say, (set-verify-guards-eagerness 3).
; The same concern applies to defconst, not only for macro expansion but also
; for function calls, and could be handled in the case of complete guard
; checking in the same way as for top-level macro expansion, by binding
; guard-checking-on to t with state-global-let*.  In practice, users may not
; demand the capability for complete guard checking, so it might not be
; important to provide this capability.

; Having decided to bind guard-checking-on to nil in certify-book-fn and
; (therefore) include-book-fn, let us turn to the other cases in which we bind
; guard-checking-on.

; We discussed defconst briefly above.  We note that raw Lisp evaluation should
; never take place for the body of a defconst form (outside the boot-strap),
; because the raw Lisp definition of defconst avoids such evaluation when the
; name is already bound, which should be the case from prior evaluation of the
; defconst form in the ACL2 loop.  Value-triple also is not evaluated in raw
; Lisp, where it is defined to return nil.

; We bind guard-checking-on to nil in prove, because proofs can use evaluation
; and such evaluation should be done in the logic, without regard to guards.

; It can be important to check guards during theory operations like
; union-theory, not only during certify-book but in the interactive loop.  For
; example, with guard checking off in Version_2.9, one gets a hard Lisp error
; upon evaluation of the following form.

; (in-theory (union-theories '((:rewrite no-such-rule))
;                            (current-theory 'ground-zero)))

; (Aside.  One does not get such an error in Version_2.8, because *1* functions
; checked guards of system functions regardless of the value of
; guard-checking-on; but we have abandoned that aggressive approach, relying
; instead on safe-mode.)  Our solution is to bind guard-checking-on to t in
; translate-in-theory-hint, which calls simple-translate-and-eval and hence
; causes the guards to be checked.

; Note that guard-checking-on is bound to nil in pc-single-step-primitive.  We
; no longer recall why, but we may as well preserve that binding.

; Essay on .acl2x Files (Double Certification)

; Sometimes make-event expansion requires a trust tag, but the final event does
; not, in which case we may want a "clean" certificate that does not depend on
; a trust tag.  For example, a make-event form might call an external tool to
; generate an ordinary ACL2 event.  Certify-book solves this problem by
; supporting a form of "double certification" that can avoid putting trust tags
; into the certificate.  This works by saving the expansion-alist from a first
; certification of foo.lisp into file foo.acl2x, and then certifying in a way
; that first reads foo.acl2x to avoid redoing make-event expansions, thus
; perhaps avoiding the need for trust tags.  One could even certify on a
; separate machine first in order to generate foo.acl2x, for added security.

; Key to the implementation of this ``double certification'' is a new state
; global, write-acl2x, which is set in order to enable writing of the .acl2x
; file.  Also, a new certify-book keyword argument, :ttagsx, overrides :ttags
; if write-acl2x is true.  So the flow is as follows, where a single
; certify-book command is used in both certifications, with :ttagsx specifying
; the ttags used in the first certification and :ttags specifying the ttags
; used in the second certification (perhaps nil).
; 
; First certification: (set-write-acl2x t state) and certify, writing out
; foo.acl2x.  Second certification: Replace forms as per foo.acl2x; write out
; foo.cert.

; Why do we use a state global, rather than adding a keyword option to
; certify-book?  The reason is that it's easier this way to provide makefile
; support: the same .acl2 file can be used for each of the two certifications
; if the makefile sends an extra set-write-acl2x form before the first
; certification.  (And, that is what is done in community books file
; books/Makefile-generic.)

; Note that include-book is not affected by this proposal, because foo.acl2x is
; not consulted: its effect is already recorded in the .cert file produced by
; the second certify-book call.  However, after that certification, the
; certificate is not polluted by ttags that were needed only for make-event
; expansion (assuming :check-expansion has its default value of nil in each
; case).

; Some details:

; - If write-acl2x has value t, then we overwrite an existing .acl2x file.  (If
;   there is demand we could cause an error instead; maybe we'll support value
;   :overwrite for that.  But we don't have any protection against overwriting
;   .cert files, so we'll start by not providing any for .acl2x files, either.)
;   If write-acl2x has value nil, then certify-book will use the .acl2x file if
;   it exists and is not older than the .lisp file; but it will never insist on
;   a .acl2x file (though the Makefile could do that).  We could consider
;   adding an argument to certify-book that insists on having an up-to-date
;   .acl2x file.

; - If write-acl2x has value t, we exit as soon as the .acl2x file is written.
;   Not only does this avoid computation necessary for writing a .cert file,
;   but also it avoids potential confusion with makefiles, so that presence of
;   a .cert file indicates that certification is truly complete.

; - When foo.acl2x exists and write-acl2x has value nil, we check that the form
;   read is suitable input to subst-by-position: an alist with increasing posp
;   keys, whose last key does not exceed the number of events to process.

; - Consider the input expansion-alist used by the second certify-book call,
;   taken from the .acl2x file (to substitute for top-level forms in the book),
;   and consider an arbitrary entry (index . form) from that input
;   expansion-alist such that index doesn't appear in the generated
;   expansion-alist written to the .cert file.  Before writing that generated
;   expansion-alist to the .cert file, we first add every such (index . form)
;   to the generated expansion-alist, to make complete the recording of all
;   replacements of top-level forms from the source book.  Note that in this
;   case form is not subject to make-event expansion, or else index would have
;   been included already in the generated expansion-alist.  (Even when an
;   event is ultimately local and hence is modified by elide-locals, a
;   record-expansion form is put into the expansion-alist.)

; - Note that one could create the .acl2x file manually to contain any forms
;   one likes, to be processed in place of forms in the source book.  There is
;   no problem with that.

; - The same use of *print-circle* will be made in writing out the .acl2x file
;   as is used when writing the :expansion-alist to the .cert file.

; One might think that one would have to incorporate somehow the checksum of
; the .acl2x file.  But the logical content of the certified book depends only
; on the .lisp file and the expansion-alist recorded in the .cert file, not on
; the .acl2x file (which was only used to generate that recorded
; expansion-alist).  We already have a mechanism to check those: in particular,
; chk-raise-portcullis (called by chk-certificate-file1) checks the checksum of
; the certificate object against the final value in the .cert file.

; Makefile support is available; see community books file
; books/Makefile-generic.

(defstub acl2x-expansion-alist (expansion-alist state)

; Users are welcome to attach their own function to acl2x-expansion-alist,
; because it is only called (by write-acl2x-file) to write out a .acl2x file,
; not to write out a .cert file.  We pass in state because some users might
; want to read from the state, for example, obtaining values of state globals.
; Indeed, for this reason, Jared Davis and Sol Swords requested the addition of
; state as a parameter.

; We may need to create a defpkg in the certification world in order to read
; the expansion-alist from the certificate before evaluating events from the
; book.  As long as there have been no new defpkg events since the end of the
; portcullis command evaluation, there is no problem.  (Note that make-event-fn
; calls bad-lisp-objectp to check that the expansion is readable after
; evaluating the make-event call.)  But once we get a new package, any
; subsequent form in the expansion-alist may need that new package to be
; defined in order for ACL2 to read the expansion-alist from the .cert file.
; Here we take the first step towards finding those packages.

  ~ev[]
  where ~c[book-name] is a book name (~pl[book-name]), ~c[k] is used to
  indicate your approval of the ``certification ~il[world],'' and
  ~c[compile-flg] can control whether the book is to be compiled.  The defaults
  for ~c[compile-flg], ~c[skip-proofs-okp], ~c[acl2x], ~c[write-port], and
  ~c[pcert] can be affected by environment variables.  All of these arguments
  are described in detail below, except for ~c[:pcert].  (We assume below that
  the value of ~c[:pcert] is ~c[nil] (and environment variable
  ~c[ACL2_PCERT_ARG] is unset or the empty string).  For a discussion of this
  argument, ~pl[provisional-certification].)

  Certification occurs in some logical ~il[world], called the ``certification
  ~il[world].''  That ~il[world] must contain the ~ilc[defpkg]s needed to read
  and execute the forms in the book.  The ~il[command]s necessary to recreate
  that ~il[world] from the ACL2 initial ~il[world] are called the
  ``~il[portcullis] commands,'' and will be copied into the ~il[certificate]
  created for the book.  Those ~il[command]s will be re-executed whenever the
  book is included, to ensure that the appropriate packages (and all other
  names used in the certification ~il[world]) are correctly defined.  The
  certified book will be more often usable if the certification ~il[world] is
  kept to a minimal extension of the ACL2 initial ~il[world] (for example, to
  prevent name clashes with functions defined in other books).  Thus, before
  you call ~c[certify-book] for the first time on a book, you may wish to get
  into the initial ACL2 ~il[world] (e.g., with ~c[:ubt 1] or just starting a
  new version of ACL2), ~ilc[defpkg] the desired packages, and then invoke
  ~c[certify-book].

  The ~c[k] argument to ~c[certify-book] must be either a nonnegative integer
  or else one of the symbols ~c[t] or ~c[?] in the ~c[ACL2] package.  If ~c[k]
  is an integer, then it must be the number of ~il[command]s that have been
  executed after the initial ACL2 ~il[world] to create the ~il[world] in which
  ~c[certify-book] was called.  One way to obtain this number is by doing
  ~c[:pbt :start] to see all the ~il[command]s back to the first one.

  If ~c[k] is ~c[t] it means that ~c[certify-book] should use the same
  ~il[world] used in the last certification of this book.  ~c[K] may be ~c[t]
  only if you call ~c[certify-book] in the initial ACL2 ~il[world] and there is
  a ~il[certificate] on file for the book being certified.  (Of course, the
  ~il[certificate] is probably invalid.)  In this case, ~c[certify-book] reads
  the old ~il[certificate] to obtain the ~il[portcullis] ~il[command]s and
  executes them to recreate the certification ~il[world].

  Finally, ~c[k] may be ~c[?], in which case there is no check made on the
  certification world.  That is, if ~c[k] is ~c[?] then no action related to
  the preceding two paragraphs is performed, which can be a nice convenience
  but at the cost of eliminating a potentially valuable check that the
  certification ~il[world] may be as expected.

  We next describe the meaning of ~c[compile-flg] and how it defaults.  If
  explicit compilation has been suppressed by
  ~c[(set-compiler-enabled nil state)], then ~c[compile-flg] is coerced to
  ~c[nil]; ~pl[compilation].  Otherwise ~c[compile-flg] may be given the value
  of ~c[t] (or ~c[:all], which is equivalent to ~c[t] except during provisional
  certification; ~pl[provisional-certification]), indicating that the book is
  to be compiled, or else ~c[nil].  (Note that compilation initially creates a
  compiled file with a temporary file name, and then moves that temporary file
  to the final compiled file name obtained by adding a suitable extension to
  the book name.  Thus, a compiled file will appear atomically in its intended
  location.)  Finally, suppose that ~c[compile-flg] is not supplied (or is
  ~c[:default]).  If environment variable ~c[ACL2_COMPILE_FLG] is defined and
  not the empty string, then its value should be ~c[T], ~c[NIL], or ~c[ALL]
  after converting to upper case, in which case ~c[compile-flg] is considered
  to have value ~c[t], ~c[nil], or ~c[:all] (respectively).  Otherwise
  ~c[compile-flg] defaults to ~c[t].  Note that the value ~c[:all] is
  equivalent to ~c[t] except for during the Convert procedure of provisional
  certification; ~pl[provisional-certification].

  Two keyword arguments, ~c[:defaxioms-okp] and ~c[:skip-proofs-okp], determine
  how the system handles the inclusion of ~ilc[defaxiom] events and
  ~ilc[skip-proofs] events, respectively, in the book.  The value ~c[t] allows
  such events, but prints a warning message.  The value ~c[nil] causes an error
  if such an event is found.  ~c[Nil] is the default unless keyword argument
  ~c[:acl2x t] is provided and state global ~c['write-acl2x] is a cons
  (~pl[set-write-acl2x]), in which case the default is ~c[t].

  The keyword argument ~c[:ttags] may normally be omitted.  A few constructs,
  used for example if you are building your own system based on ACL2, may
  require it.  ~l[defttag] for an explanation of this argument.

  When book ~c[B] is certified with value ~c[t] (the default) for keyword
  argument ~c[:write-port], a file ~c[B.port] is written by certification
  process.  This file contains all of the ~il[portcullis] ~il[command]s for
  ~c[B], i.e., all user commands present in the ACL2 logical ~il[world] at the
  time ~c[certify-book] is called.  if ~c[B.lisp] later becomes uncertified,
  say because ~il[events] from that file or an included book have been edited,
  then ~c[(include-book \"B\")] will consult ~c[B.port] to evaluate forms in
  that file before evaluating the events in ~c[B.lisp].  On the other hand,
  ~c[B.port] is ignored when including ~c[B] if ~c[B] is certified.

  If you use ~il[guard]s, please note ~c[certify-book] is executed as though
  ~c[(set-guard-checking nil)] has been evaluated; ~pl[set-guard-checking].  If
  you want guards checked, consider using ~c[ld] instead, or in addition;
  ~pl[ld].

  For a general discussion of books, ~pl[books].  ~c[Certify-book] is akin to
  what we have historically called a ``proveall'': all the forms in the book
  are ``proved'' to guarantee their admissibility.  More precisely,
  ~c[certify-book] (1) reads the forms in the book, confirming that the
  appropriate packages are defined in the certification ~il[world]; (2) does
  the full admissibility checks on each form (proving termination of recursive
  functions, proving theorems, etc.), checking as it goes that each form is an
  embedded event form (~pl[embedded-event-form]); (3) rolls the ~il[world] back
  to the initial certification ~il[world] and does an ~ilc[include-book] of the
  book to check for ~ilc[local] incompatibilities (~pl[local-incompatibility]);
  (4) writes a ~il[certificate] recording not only that the book was certified
  but also recording the ~il[command]s necessary to recreate the certification
  ~il[world] (so the appropriate packages can be defined when the book is
  included in other ~il[world]s) and the check sums of all the ~il[books]
  involved (~pl[certificate]); (5) compiles the book if so directed (and then
  loads the object file in that case).  The result of executing a
  ~c[certify-book] ~il[command] is the creation of a single new event, which is
  actually an ~ilc[include-book] event.  If you don't want its included
  ~il[events] in your present ~il[world], simply execute ~c[:]~ilc[ubt]
  ~c[:here] afterwards.

  A utility is provided to assist in debugging failures of ~c[certify-book];
  ~pl[redo-flat].)

  ~c[Certify-book] requires that the default ~il[defun-mode]
  (~pl[default-defun-mode]) be ~c[:]~ilc[logic] when certification is
  attempted.  If the mode is not ~c[:]~ilc[logic], an error is signalled.

  An error will occur if ~c[certify-book] has to deal with any uncertified book
  other than the one on which it was called.  For example, if the book being
  certified includes another book, that subbook must already have been
  certified.

  If you have a certified book that has remained unchanged for some time you
  might well not remember the appropriate ~ilc[defpkg]s for it, though they are
  stored in the ~il[certificate] file and (by default) also in the ~c[.port]
  file.  If you begin to change the book, don't throw away its ~il[certificate]
  file just because it has become invalid!  It is an important historical
  document until the book is re-certified.  More important, don't throw away
  the ~c[.port] file, as it will provide the ~il[portcullis] commands when
  including the book as an uncertified book; ~pl[include-book].

  When ~c[certify-book] is directed to produce a compiled file, it calls the
  Common Lisp function ~c[compile-file] on the original source file.  This
  creates a compiled file with an extension known to ACL2, e.g., if the book is
  named ~c[\"my-book\"] then the source file is ~c[\"my-book.lisp\"] and the
  compiled file under GCL will be ~c[\"my-book.o\"] while under SBCL it will be
  ~c[\"my-book.fasl\"].  The compiled file is then loaded.  When
  ~ilc[include-book] is used later on ~c[\"my-book\"] it will automatically
  load the compiled file, provided the compiled file has a later write date
  than the source file.  The only effect of such ~il[compilation] and loading
  is that the functions defined in the book execute faster.  ~l[guard] for a
  discussion of the issues, and if you want more details about ~il[books] and
  compilation, ~pl[book-compiled-file].

  When ~c[certify-book] is directed not to produce a compiled file, it will
  delete any existing compiled file for the book, so as not to mislead
  ~ilc[include-book] into loading the now outdated compiled file.  Otherwise,
  ~c[certify-book] will create a temporary ``expansion file'' to compile,
  obtained by appending the string \"@expansion.lsp\" to the end of the book
  name.  Remark: Users may ignore that file, which is automatically deleted
  unless ~il[state] global variable ~c['save-expansion-file] has been set,
  presumably by a system developer, to a non-~c[nil] value;
  ~pl[book-compiled-file] for more information about hit issue, including the
  role of environment variable ~c[ACL2_SAVE_EXPANSION].

  After execution of a ~c[certify-book] form, the value of
  ~ilc[acl2-defaults-table] is restored to what it was immediately before that
  ~c[certify-book] form was executed.  ~l[acl2-defaults-table].

  Those who use the relatively advanced features of trust tags (~pl[defttag])
  and ~ilc[make-event] may wish to know how to create a ~il[certificate] file
  that avoids dependence on trust tags that are used only during
  ~ilc[make-event] expansion.  For this, including documentation of the
  ~c[:acl2x] and ~c[:ttagsx] keyword arguments for ~c[certify-book],
  ~pl[set-write-acl2x].

  This completes the tour through the ~il[documentation] of ~il[books].~/

(defdoc provisional-certification

; Here we put random remarks about provisional certification that are not fully
; covered in the :doc topic (which serves as a prerequisite for these remarks).

; Let us consider the :pcert-info field of a cert-obj, which comes from the
; :pcert-info field of a .pcert0 file.  The value is :PROVED when the .pcert0
; file was created by the Pcertify+ procedure, but now we consider the value
; when the .pcert0 file was created by the Pcertify procedure.  The value is an
; expansion-alist that associates indices with full expansions, before applying
; elide-locals or elide-locals-rec.  When there is no such elision in the
; regular :expansion-alist, no entry is made in the :pcert-info field.  We do
; not elide locals during the Pcertify procedure; then when writing out the
; .pcert0 file, we use a strong version of
; elide-locals-and-split-expansion-alist (essentially, a strong version of
; elide-locals-from-expansion-alist) that dives inside encapsulates to elide
; locals.  Note that the :pcert-info field does not contribute to the checksum
; of a cert-obj (see check-sum-cert-obj and check-sum-cert), the reason being
; that we want the computed checksums not to change between a .pcert0 file and
; the .pcert1 file derived from it.

; Next, we discuss issues related to include-book and provisionally certified
; books.

; ACL2 users sometimes arrange to include books to build a certification world,
; as a precursor to a call of certify-book.  When using provisional
; certification, the .cert files might not exist for those books.  Of course,
; we allow .pcert0 and .pcert1 files to serve as certificate files when inside
; a call of certify-book with a :pcert argument of :create or :convert.  But
; the include-book forms mentioned above are executed before calling
; certify-book.  How can we support the use of .pcert0 and .pcert1 files in
; such cases?

; Our solution is to allow .pcert0 and .pcert1 files to serve as certificate
; files in all circumstances, with the following two kinds of special handling.
; First, and most important, we do the following two things: (a) we make a note
; in the world (in world global pcert-books) when cert-op is not :create-pcert,
; :create+convert-pcert or :convert-pcert, and an include-book has taken place
; that uses a .pcert0 or .pcert1 file as a certificate, and (b) we disallow
; certify-book in any such world unless the :pcert argument has value :create,
; t, or :convert (where this argument might, of course, come from environment
; variable ACL2_PCERT_ARG).  Second, we print a warning when using a .pcert0 or
; .pcert1 file unless we are in an environment with ACL2_PCERT set to a
; non-empty string.  (Of course, that warning may also be inhibited by
; set-inhibit-warnings or set-inhibit-output-lst.)

  ":Doc-Section Books

  certify a book in stages for improved parallelism~/

  Provisional certification is a process that can increase parallelism at the
  system level, typically using `make', when certifying a collection of
  ~il[books].  We got this idea from Jared Davis, who developed rudimentary
  provisional certification schemes first at Rockwell Collins and later for his
  `Milawa' project.  Our design has also benefited from conversations with Sol
  Swords.

  Perhaps the easiest way to invoke provisional certification is with the
  `make' approach supported by the ACL2 system; ~pl[book-makefiles].  We begin
  by describing a few ways to do that.  A simple way is to add the line
  `~c[ACL2_PCERT=t]' to a `~c[make]' command that you use for book
  certification, for example as follows.  (But use ~c[ACL2_JOBS] instead of
  ~c[-j] if you are doing a regression rather than working a specific
  subdirectory of the books; ~pl[book-makefiles].)
  ~bv[]
  make -j 4 ACL2_PCERT=t
  ~ev[]
  The following works too, in a bash shell.
  ~bv[]
  (export ACL2_PCERT=t ; time make -j 4)
  ~ev[]
  Alternatively, add the line
  ~bv[]
  ACL2_PCERT = t
  ~ev[]
  to the ~c[Makefile] residing in a directory, placed above the line that
  specifies the `~c[include]' of file ~c[Makefile-generic].

  A successful `make' will result in create the desired
  ~il[certificate] (~c[.cert]) files.  See community books file
  ~c[books/system/pcert/Makefile] for an example.

  Warning: If you put the line ``~c[ACL2_PCERT = t]'' below the include of
  ~c[Makefile-generic], it might have no effect.  For example, try editing
  community books file ~c[books/system/pcert/Makefile] by moving the line
  ``~c[ACL2_PCERT = t]'' to the bottom of the file, and watch
  ``~c[make top.cert]'' fail to invoke provisional certification.

  The description above may be sufficient for you to use provisional
  certification.  We provide additional documentation below for the reader who
  wants to understand more about this process, for example when not using
  `make'.  Below we assume prior familiarity with ~il[books], in particular
  ~ilc[certify-book] and ~ilc[include-book].  The remainder of this
  ~il[documentation] topic is divided into sections: Summary, Correctness Claim
  and Issues, Combining Pcertify and Convert into Pcertify+, and Further
  Information.~/

  ~st[Summary]

  Recall that certification of a book, ~c[bk], produces a ~il[certificate] file
  ~c[bk.cert].  The provisional certification process produces this file as
  well, but as the last of the following three steps.  All of these steps are
  carried out by calls of ~ilc[certify-book] using its ~c[:pcert] keyword
  argument.  We typically call these steps ``procedures'', to distinguish them
  from the steps of an individual call of ~ilc[certify-book].
  ~bq[]
  o The ``Pcertify'' procedure (sometimes called the ``Create'' procedure) is
  invoked by calling ~ilc[certify-book] with keyword argument
  ~c[:pcert :create].  It produces a file ~c[bk.pcert0], sometimes called the
  ``~c[.pcert0]'' file (pronounced ``dot pee cert zero'').  Proofs are skipped
  during this procedure, which can be viewed as an elaborate syntax check,
  augmented by compilation if specified (as it is by default).

  o The ``Convert'' procedure is invoked by calling ~ilc[certify-book] with
  keyword argument ~c[:pcert :convert].  It creates file ~c[bk.pcert1] from
  ~c[bk.pcert0], by doing proofs for all events in ~c[bk.lisp].  Note that the
  third argument (the `~c[compile-flg]' argument) is ignored by such a call of
  ~c[certify-book] unless its value is ~c[:all] (either explicitly or by way of
  environment variable ~c[ACL2_COMPILE_FLG]).  A subtlety is that if there is a
  compiled file at least as recent as the corresponding ~c[.pcert0] file, then
  that compiled file's write date will be updated to the current time at the
  end of this procedure.  The usual ~il[local-incompatibility] check at the
  end of ~ilc[certify-book] is omitted for the Convert procedure, since it was
  performed towards the end of the Create procedure.

  o The ``Complete'' procedure is invoked by calling ~ilc[certify-book] with
  keyword argument ~c[:pcert :complete].  It checks that every included book
  (including every one that is ~ilc[local]ly included) has a ~c[.cert] file
  that is at least as recent as the corresponding book.  The effect is to move
  ~c[bk.pcert1] to ~c[bk.cert].  Note that all arguments of ~c[certify-book]
  other than the ~c[:pcert] argument are ignored for this procedure, other than
  for some trivial argument checking.~eq[]

  You can combine the Pcertify and Convert procedures into a single procedure,
  Pcertify+, which may be useful for books that contain expensive
  ~ilc[include-book] ~il[events] but do few proofs.  We defer discussion of
  that feature to the section below, ``Combining Pcertify and Convert into
  Pcertify+''.

  The main idea of provisional certification is to break sequential
  dependencies caused by ~ilc[include-book], that is, so that a book's proofs
  are carried out even when it includes books (sometimes called ``sub-books'')
  that have not themselves been fully certified.  For example, suppose that a
  proof development consists of books ~c[A.lisp], ~c[B.lisp], and ~c[C.lisp],
  where file ~c[A.lisp] contains the form ~c[(include-book \"B\")] and file
  ~c[B.lisp] contains the form ~c[(include-book \"C\")].  Normally one would
  first certify ~c[C], then ~c[B], and finally, ~c[A].  However, the
  provisional certification process can speed up the process on a multi-core
  machine, as follows: the Pcertify (pronounced ``pee certify'') procedure
  respects this order but (one hopes) is fast since proofs are skipped; the
  Convert procedure essentially completes the certification in parallel by
  doing proofs and creating ~c[.pcert1] files based on ~c[.pcert0] files; and
  the Complete procedure respects book order when quickly renaming ~c[.pcert1]
  files to ~c[.cert] files.  In our example, the steps would be as follows, but
  note that we need not finish all Pcertify steps before starting some Convert
  steps, nor need we finish all Convert steps before starting some Complete
  steps, as explained further below.
  ~bq[]
  o Pcertify books \"C\", \"B\",and then \"A\", sequentially, skipping proofs
  but doing compilation.

  o Do proofs in parallel for the books using the Convert procedure, where each
  book relies on the existence of its own ~c[.pcert0] file as well as a
  ~c[.cert], ~c[.pcert0], or ~c[.pcert1] file for each of its included
  sub-books.  Write out a ~c[.pcert1] file for the book when the proof
  succeeds.

  o Rename the ~c[.pcert1] file to a corresponding ~c[.cert] file when a
  ~c[.cert] file exists and is up-to-date for each included book.~eq[]

  The Convert step can begin for ~c[bk.lisp] any time after ~c[bk.pcert0] is
  built.  The Complete step can begin for this book any time after
  ~c[bk.pcert1] and every ~c[sub-bk.cert] are built, for ~c[sub-bk] a sub-book
  of ~c[bk].

  The new procedures ~-[] Pcertify, Convert, and Complete ~-[] are invoked by
  supplying a value for the keyword argument ~c[:pcert] of ~ilc[certify-book],
  namely ~c[:create], ~c[:convert], or ~c[:complete], respectively.  Typically,
  and by default, the ~c[compile-flg] argument of ~ilc[certify-book] is ~c[t]
  for the Pcertify procedure, so that ~il[compilation] can take full advantage
  of parallelism.  This argument is treated as ~c[nil] for the other procedures
  except when its value is ~c[:all] in the Convert procedure, as mentioned
  above.

  For those who use ~ilc[make-event], we note that expansion is done in the
  Pcertify procedure; the later steps use the expansion resulting from that
  procedure.  The reason is that although a call of ~ilc[make-event] is similar
  to a macro call, a difference is that the expansion of a ~c[make-event] form
  can depend on the ~il[state].  Therefore, we insist on doing such an
  expansion only once, so that all books involved agree on the expansion.  We
  say more about ~c[make-event] below.

  ~st[Correctness Claim and Issues]

  The Basic Claim for certification is the same whether or not the provisional
  certification process is employed: all books should be certified from
  scratch, with no files written to the directories of the books except by
  ACL2.  Moreover, no trust tags should be used (~pl[defttag]), or else it is
  the responsibility of the user to investigate every occurrence of
  ``~c[TTAG NOTE]'' that is printed to standard output.

  But common practice is to certify a set of books in stages: certify a few
  books, fix some books, re-certify changed books, certify some more books, and
  so on.  In practice, we expect this process to be sound even though it does
  not meet the preconditions for the Basic Claim above.  In particular, we
  expect that the use of checksums in ~il[certificate]s will make it
  exceedingly unlikely that a book is still treated as certified after any
  events in the book or any sub-book, or any ~il[portcullis] ~il[command]s of
  the book or any sub-book, have been modified.

  Provisional certification makes it a bit easier for a determined user to
  subvert correctness.  For example, the Complete procedure only checks write
  dates to ensure that each sub-book's ~c[.cert] file is no older than the
  corresponding ~c[.lisp] file, but it does not look inside ~c[.cert] files of
  sub-books; in particular it does not look at their checksum information.  Of
  course, the automatic dependency analysis provided by `make' avoids
  accidental problems of this sort.  And, checksum information will indeed be
  applied at ~ilc[include-book] time, at least for sub-books included
  non-~il[local]ly.

  In short: while we believe that the provisional certification process can be
  trusted, we suggest that for maximum trust, it is best for all books in a
  project to be certified from scratch without the provisional certification
  process.

  ~st[Combining Pcertify and Convert into Pcertify+]

  You can combine the Pcertify and Convert procedure into a single procedure,
  Pcertify+, which may be useful for books that contain expensive
  ~ilc[include-book] ~il[events] but do few proofs.  If you are using the ACL2
  `make' approach to do provisional certification, just set `make' variable
  ~c[ACL2_BOOKS_PCERT_ARG_T] to the list of books for which you want the
  Pcertify+ procedure performed instead of separate Pcertify and Convert
  procedures.  Either of two common methods may be used to set this variable,
  as illustrated below for the case that books ~c[sub.lisp] and ~c[mid.lisp]
  are the ones on which you want Pcertify+ performed.  One method is to add the
  following to your directory's Makefile, above the ~c[include] of
  ~c[Makefile-generic].
  ~bv[]
  ACL2_BOOKS_PCERT_ARG_T = sub mid
  ~ev[]
  Alternatively, you can specify the desired books on the command line, for
  example as follows.
  ~bv[]
  make -j 4 ACL2_BOOKS_PCERT_ARG_T='sub mid'
  ~ev[]
  Note that the books are given without their ~c[.lisp] extensions.

  At the ACL2 level, the Pcertify+ procedure is performed when the value ~c[t]
  is supplied to the ~c[:pcert] keyword argument of ~ilc[certify-book].  Thus,
  ~c[:pcert t] can be thought of as a combination of ~c[:pcert :create] and
  ~c[:pcert :convert].  However, what ACL2 actually does is to perform the
  Pcertify step without skipping proofs, and at the end of the ~c[certify-book]
  run, it writes out both the ~c[.pcert0] and ~c[.pcert1] file, with
  essentially the same contents.  (We say ``essentially'' because the
  implementation writes ~c[:PCERT-INFO :PROVED] to the end of the ~c[.pcert0]
  file, but not to the ~c[.pcert1] file.)

  ~st[Further Information]

  Some errors during provisional certification cannot be readily solved.  For
  example, if there are circular directory dependencies (for example, some book
  in directory D1 includes some book in directory D2 and vice-versa), then the
  standard ACL2 `make'-based provisional certification will quite possibly
  fail.  For another example, perhaps your directory's Makefile is awkward to
  convert to one with suitable dependencies.  When no fix is at hand, it might
  be best simply to avoid provisional certification.  If you are using the
  standard ACL2 `make'-based approach, you can simply add the following line to
  your directory's ~c[Makefile], or use ``~c[ACL2_PCERT= ]'' on the `make'
  command line, to avoid provisional certification.
  ~bv[]
  override ACL2_PCERT =
  ~ev[]

  We invite anyone who has troubleshooting tips to contact the ACL2 developers
  with suggestions for adding such tips to this section.

  Our next remark is relevant only to users of ~ilc[make-event], and concerns
  the interaction of that utility with state global ~ilc[ld-skip-proofsp].
  Normally, the global value of ~ilc[ld-skip-proofsp] is unchanged during
  ~c[make-event] expansion, except that it is bound to ~c[nil] when the
  ~c[make-event] form has a non-~c[nil] ~c[:check-expansion] argument.  But
  during the Pcertify procedure (not the Pcertify+ procedure),
  ~ilc[ld-skip-proofsp] is always bound to ~c[nil] at the start of
  ~c[make-event] expansion.  To see why, consider for example the community
  book ~c[books/make-event/proof-by-arith.lisp].  This book introduces a macro,
  ~c[proof-by-arith], that expands to a call of ~ilc[make-event].  This
  ~c[make-event] form expands by trying to prove a given theorem using a
  succession of included arithmetic books, until the proof succeeds.  Now
  proofs are skipped during the Pcertify procedure, and if proofs were also
  skipped during ~c[make-event] expansion within that procedure, the first
  arithmetic book's ~ilc[include-book] form would always be saved because the
  theorem's proof ``succeeded'' (as it was skipped!).  Of course, the theorem's
  proof could then easily fail during the Convert step.  If you really want to
  inhibit proofs during ~c[make-event] expansion in the Pcertify step, consider
  using a form such as the following:
  ~c[(state-global-let* ((ld-skip-proofsp nil)) ...)].

  Finally, we describe what it means for there to be a valid ~il[certificate]
  file for including a certified book.  Normally, this is a file with extension
  ~c[.cert].  However, if that ~c[.cert] file does not exist, then ACL2 looks
  for a ~c[.pcert0] file instead; and if that also does not exist, it looks for
  a ~c[.pcert1] file.  (To see why does the ~c[.pcert0] file take priority over
  the ~c[.pcert1] file, note that the Convert procedure copies a ~c[.pcert0]
  file to a ~c[.pcert1] file, so both might exist ~-[] but the ~c[.pcert1] file
  might be incomplete if copying is in progress.)  Once the candidate
  certificate file is thus selected, it must be valid in order for the book to
  be considered certified (~pl[certificate]).  For the certificate file as
  chosen above, then in order for a compiled file to be loaded, it must be at
  least as recent as that certificate file.

  Again, as discussed above, a ~c[.pcert0] or ~c[.pcert1] file may serve as a
  valid certificate file when the ~c[.cert] file is missing.  But when that
  happens, a warning may be printed that a ``provisionally certified'' book has
  been included.  No such warning occurs if environment variable ~c[ACL2_PCERT]
  has a non-empty value, or if that warning is explicitly inhibited
  (~pl[set-inhibit-warnings] and ~pl[set-inhibit-output-lst]).")

  introduction to filename conventions in ACL2~/

  The notion of pathname objects from Common Lisp is not supported in
  ACL2, nor is the function ~c[pathname].  However, ACL2 supports file
  operations, using conventions for naming files based on those of the
  Unix (trademark of AT&T) operating system, so that the character ~c[/]
  is used to terminate directory names.  Some file names are ``absolute''
  (complete) descriptions of a file or directory; others are
  ``relative'' to the current working directory or to the connected
  book directory (~pl[cbd]).  We emphasize that even for users of
  Windows-based systems or Macintosh computers, ACL2 file names are in
  the Unix style.  We will call these ~em[ACL2 pathnames], often
  omitting the ``ACL2.''~/

  Pathnames starting with the directory separator (~c[/]) or the tilde
  character (~c[~~]) are absolute pathnames.  All other pathnames are relative
  pathnames.  An exception is in the Microsoft Windows operating system, where
  it is illegal for the pathname to start with a tilde character but the drive
  may be included, e.g., ~c[\"c:/home/smith/acl2/book-1.lisp\"].  In fact, the
  drive ~em[must] be included in the portcullis of a book; ~pl[portcullis].
  Note also that some host Common Lisps will not support pathnames starting
  with ~c[\"~~\"], for example ~c[~~smith], though ACL2 will generally support
  those starting with ~c[\"~~/\"] regardless of the host Common Lisp.

  Consider the following examples.  The filename string
  ~bv[]
  \"/home/smith/acl2/book-1.lisp\"
  ~ev[]
  is an absolute pathname, with top-level directory ~c[\"home\"],
  under that the directory ~c[\"smith\"] and then the directory
  ~c[\"acl2\"], and finally, within that directory the file
  ~c[\"book-1.lisp\"].  If the connected book directory is
  ~c[\"/home/smith/\"] (~pl[cbd]), then the filename string above
  also corresponds to the relative filename string \"acl2/book1.lisp\".

  Finally, we note that (on non-Windows systems) the pathname ~c[\"~~\"] and
  pathnames starting with ~c[\"~~/\"] are illegal in books being certified.
  Otherwise, a subsidiary ~ilc[include-book] form would have a different
  meaning at certification time than at a later time when the certified book
  is included by a different user.~/")

  how to create, certify, and use a simple book~/

  Suppose you have developed a sequence of admissible ~il[events] which you
  want to turn into a book.  We call this ``publishing'' the book.
  This note explains how to do that.~/

  A key idea of ~il[books] is that they are ``incremental'' in the
  sense that when you include a book in a host logical ~il[world], the
  ~il[world] is incrementally extended by the results established in that
  book.  This is allowed only if every name defined by the incoming
  book is either new or is already identically defined.
  ~l[redundant-events].  This is exactly the same problem faced
  by a programmer who wishes to provide a utility to other people: how
  can he make sure he doesn't create name conflicts?  The solution, in
  Common Lisp, is also the same: use packages.  While ~il[books] and
  packages have a very tenuous formal connection (every book must
  start with an ~ilc[in-package]), the creation of a book is intimately
  concerned with the package issue.  Having motivated what would
  otherwise appear as an unnecessary fascination with packages below,
  we now proceed with a description of how to publish a book.

  Just to be concrete, let's suppose you have already gotten ACL2 to
  accept the following sequence of ~il[command]s, starting in the ACL2
  initial ~il[state].
  ~bv[]
     (defpkg \"ACL2-MY-BOOK\"
             (union-eq *common-lisp-symbols-from-main-lisp-package*
                       *acl2-exports*))
     (in-package \"ACL2-MY-BOOK\")
     (defun app (x y)
       (if (consp x) (cons (car x) (app (cdr x) y)) y))
     (defun rev (x)
       (if (consp x) (app (rev (cdr x)) (list (car x))) nil))
     (defthm rev-app-hack
       (equal (rev (app a (list x))) (cons x (rev a))))
     (defthm rev-rev 
       (implies (acl2::true-listp x) (equal (rev (rev x)) x)))
  ~ev[]
  Observe that the first form above defines a package (which imports
  the symbols defined in CLTL such as ~ilc[if] and ~ilc[cons] and the
  symbols used to ~il[command] ACL2 such as ~ilc[defun] and ~ilc[defthm]).  The
  second form selects that package as the current one.  All subsequent
  forms are read into that package.  The remaining forms are just
  event forms: ~ilc[defun]s and ~ilc[defthm]s in this case.

  Typically you would have created a file with Emacs containing these
  forms and you will have submitted each of them interactively to ACL2
  to confirm that they are all admissible.  That interactive
  verification should start in ACL2's initial ~il[world] ~-[] although
  you might, of course, start your sequence of ~il[events] with some
  ~ilc[include-book]s to build a more elaborate ~il[world].

  The first step towards publishing a book containing the results
  above is to create a file that starts with the ~ilc[in-package] and
  then contains the rest of the forms.  Let's call that file
  ~c[\"my-book.lisp\"].  The name is unimportant, except it must end
  with ~c[\".lisp\"].  If there are ~il[events] that you do not wish to be
  available to the user of the book ~-[] e.g., lemmas you proved on your
  way toward proving the main ones ~-[] you may so mark them by
  enclosing them in ~ilc[local] forms.  ~l[local].  Let us suppose
  you wish to hide ~c[rev-app-hack] above.  You may also add standard Lisp
  comments to the file.  The final content of ~c[\"my-book.lisp\"]
  might be:
  ~bv[]
   ; This book contains my app and rev functions and the theorem
   ; that rev is its own inverse.

     (in-package \"ACL2-MY-BOOK\")
     (defun app (x y)
       (if (consp x) (cons (car x) (app (cdr x) y)) y))
     (defun rev (x)
       (if (consp x) (app (rev (cdr x)) (list (car x))) nil))

   ; The following hack is not exported.
     (local (defthm rev-app-hack
       (equal (rev (app a (list x))) (cons x (rev a)))))

     (defthm rev-rev 
       (implies (acl2::true-listp x) (equal (rev (rev x)) x)))
  ~ev[]
  The file shown above ~st[is] the book.  By the time this note is
  done you will have seen how to certify that the book is correct, how
  to compile it, and how to use it in other host ~il[world]s.  Observe that
  the ~ilc[defpkg] is not in the book.  It cannot be: Common Lisp
  compilers disagree on how to treat new package definitions appearing
  in files to be compiled.

  Since a book is just a source file typed by the user, ACL2 provides
  a mechanism for checking that the ~il[events] are all admissible and then
  marking the file as checked.  This is called certification.  To
  certify ~c[\"my-book.lisp\"] you should first get into ACL2 with an
  initial ~il[world].  Then, define the package needed by the book, by
  typing the following ~ilc[defpkg] to the ACL2 ~il[prompt]:
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>(defpkg \"ACL2-MY-BOOK\"
                 (union-eq *common-lisp-symbols-from-main-lisp-package*
                           *acl2-exports*))
  ~ev[]
  Then execute the ~il[command]:
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>(certify-book \"my-book\" 1 t) ; the `t' is in fact the default
  ~ev[]
  Observe that you do not type the ~c[\".lisp\"] part of the file
  name.  For purposes of ~il[books], the book's name is ~c[\"my-book\"] and
  by the time all is said and done, there will be several extensions
  in addition to the ~c[\".lisp\"] extension associated with it.

  The ~c[1] tells ~ilc[certify-book] that you acknowledge that there is
  one command in this ``certification ~il[world]'' (namely the ~ilc[defpkg]).
  To use the book, any prospective host ~il[world] must be extended by
  the addition of whatever ~il[command]s occurred before certification.  It
  would be a pity to certify a book in a ~il[world] containing junk because
  that junk will become the ``~il[portcullis]'' guarding entrance to
  the book.  The ~c[t] above tells ~ilc[certify-book] that you wish to
  compile ~c[\"my-book.lisp\"] also (but ~pl[compilation] for an exception).
  ~ilc[Certify-book] makes many checks but by far the most important and
  time-consuming one is that it ``proves'' every event in the file.

  When ~ilc[certify-book] is done it will have created two new files.
  The first will be called ~c[\"my-book.cert\"] and contains the
  ``~il[certificate]'' attesting to the admissibility of the ~il[events] in
  ~c[\"my-book.lisp\"].  The ~il[certificate] contains the ~ilc[defpkg] and any
  other forms necessary to construct the certification ~il[world].  It also
  contains various check sums used to help you keep track of which
  version of ~c[\"my-book.lisp\"] was certified.

  The second file that may be created by ~ilc[certify-book] is the
  compiled version of ~c[\"my-book.lisp\"] and will have a name that
  is assigned by the host compiler (e.g., ~c[\"my-book.o\"] in GCL,
  ~c[\"my-book.fasl\"] in SBCL).  ~ilc[Certify-book] will also load
  this object file.  When ~ilc[certify-book] is done, you may throw
  away the logical ~il[world] it created, for example by executing the
  ~il[command] ~c[:u].

  To use the book later in any ACL2 session, just execute the event
  ~c[(include-book \"my-book\")].  This will do the necessary
  ~ilc[defpkg], load the non-~ilc[local] ~il[events] in
  ~c[\"my-book.lisp\"] and then may load the compiled code for the
  non-local functions defined in that file.  Checks are made to ensure
  that the ~il[certificate] file exists and describes the version of
  ~c[\"my-book.lisp\"] that is read.  The compiled code is loaded if
  and only if it exists and has a later write date than the source
  file (but ~pl[compilation] for an exception).

  Since ~ilc[include-book] is itself an event, you may put such forms
  into other ~il[books].  Thus it is possible for the inclusion of a single
  book to lead to the inclusion of many others.  The check sum
  information maintained in ~il[certificate]s helps deal with the
  version control problem of the referenced ~il[books].  I.e., if this
  version of ~c[\"my-book\"] is used during the certification of
  ~c[\"your-book\"], then the ~il[certificate] for ~c[\"your-book\"] includes
  the check sum of this version of ~c[\"my-book\"].  If a later
  ~c[(include-book \"your-book\")] finds a version of ~c[\"my-book\"]
  with a different check sum, an error is signalled.  But check sums
  are not perfect and the insecurity of the host file system prevents
  ACL2 from guaranteeing the logical soundness of an ~ilc[include-book]
  event, even for a book that appears to have a valid ~il[certificate]
  (they can be forged, after all).  (~l[certificate] for further
  discussion.)

  This concludes the example of how to create, certify and use a book.
  If you wish, you could now review the ~il[documentation] for book-related
  topics (~pl[books]) and browse through them.  They'll probably
  make sense in this context.  Alternatively, you could continue the
  ``guided tour'' through the rest of the ~il[documentation] of ~il[books].

  book naming conventions assumed by ACL2~/

  For this discussion we assume that the resident operating system is
  Unix (trademark of AT&T), but analogous remarks apply to other
  operating systems supported by ACL2, in particular, the Macintosh
  operating system where `~c[:]' plays roughly the role of `~c[/]' in
  Unix; ~pl[pathname].

  ACL2 defines a ``full book name'' to be an ``absolute filename
  string,'' that may be divided into contiguous sections:  a
  ``directory string'', a ``familiar name'' and an ``extension''.
  ~l[pathname] for the definitions of ``absolute,'' ``filename
  string,'' and other notions pertaining to naming files.  Below we
  exhibit the three sections of one such string:
  ~bv[]
  \"/usr/home/smith/project/arith.lisp\"

  \"/usr/home/smith/project/\"           ; directory string
                          \"arith\"      ; familiar name
                               \".lisp\" ; extension~/
  ~ev[]
  The sections are marked by the rightmost slash and rightmost dot,
  as shown below.
  ~bv[]
  \"/usr/home/smith/project/arith.lisp\"
                          |     |
                          slash dot

  \"/usr/home/smith/project/\"           ; directory string
                          \"arith\"      ; familiar name
                               \".lisp\" ; extension
  ~ev[]
  The directory string includes (and terminates with) the rightmost
  slash.  The extension includes (and starts with) the rightmost dot.
  The dot must be strictly to the right of the slash so that the
  familiar name is well-defined and nonempty.

  conventions associated with book names~/
  ~bv[]
  Examples:
  \"list-processing\"
  \"/usr/home/smith/my-arith\"
  ~ev[]
  Book names are string constants that can be elaborated into file
  names.  We elaborate book names by concatenating the ``connected
  book directory'' (~pl[cbd]) string on the left and some
  ``extension,'' such as ~c[\".lisp\"], on the right.  However, the
  connected book directory is not added if the book name itself
  already represents an absolute file name.  Furthermore,
  ~ilc[include-book] and ~ilc[certify-book] temporarily reset the connected
  book directory to be the directory of the book being processed.
  This allows ~ilc[include-book] forms to use file names without explicit
  mention of the enclosing book's directory.  This in turn allows
  ~il[books] (together with those that they include, using
  ~ilc[include-book]) to be moved between directories while maintaining
  their certification and utility.

  You may wish to read elsewhere for details of ACL2 file name
  conventions (~pl[pathname]), for a discussion of the filename
  that is the result of the elaboration described here
  (~pl[full-book-name]), and for details of the concept of the
  connected book directory (~pl[cbd]).  For details of how
  ~ilc[include-book] (~pl[include-book]) and ~ilc[certify-book]
  (~pl[certify-book]) use these concepts, see below.~/

  Often a book name is simply the familiar name of the file.
  (~l[full-book-name] for discussion of the notions of
  ``directory string,'' ``familiar name,'' and ``extension''.  These
  concepts are not on the guided tour through ~il[books] and you
  should read them separately.)  However, it is permitted for book
  names to include a directory or part of a directory name.  Book
  names never include the extension, since ACL2 must routinely tack
  several different extensions onto the name during ~ilc[include-book].
  For example, ~ilc[include-book] uses the ~c[\".lisp\"], ~c[\".cert\"] and
  possibly the ~c[\".o\"] or ~c[\".lbin\"] extensions of the book name.

  Book names are elaborated into full file names by ~ilc[include-book]
  and ~ilc[certify-book].  This elaboration is sensitive to the
  ``connected book directory.'' The connected book directory is an
  absolute filename string (~pl[pathname]) that is part of the
  ACL2 ~ilc[state].  (You may wish to ~pl[cbd] and to
  ~pl[set-cbd] ~-[] note that these are not on the guided tour).
  If a book name is an absolute filename string, ACL2 elaborates it
  simply by appending the desired extension to the right.
  If a book name is a relative filename string, ACL2 appends the
  connected book directory on the left and the desired extension on
  the right.

  Note that it is possible that the book name includes some partial
  specification of the directory.  For example, if the connected book
  directory is ~c[\"/usr/home/smith/\"] then the book name
  ~c[\"project/task-1/arith\"] is a book name that will be elaborated

  restrictions on the forms inside ~il[books]~/

  Example Book:

  ; This book defines my app function and the theorem that it is
  ; associative.  One irrelevant help lemma is proved first but
  ; it is local and so not seen by include-book.  I depend on the
  ; inferior book \"weird-list-primitives\" from which I get
  ; definitions of hd and tl.

  (in-package \"MY-PKG\")

  (include-book \"weird-list-primitives\")

  (defun app (x y) (if (consp x) (cons (hd x) (app (tl x) y)) y))

   (defthm help-lemma
     (implies (true-listp x) (equal (app x nil) x))))

  (defthm app-is-associative
    (equal (app (app a b) c) (app a (app b c))))~/

  ~ev[]
  The first form in a book must be ~c[(in-package \"pkg\")] where
  ~c[\"pkg\"] is some package name known to ACL2 whenever the book is
  certified.  The rest of the forms in a book are embedded event
  forms, i.e., ~ilc[defun]s, ~ilc[defthm]s, etc., some of which may be
  marked ~ilc[local].  ~l[embedded-event-form].  The usual Common
  Lisp commenting conventions are provided.  Note that since a book
  consists of embedded event forms, we can talk about the
  ``~ilc[local]'' and ``non-local'' ~il[events] of a book.

  Because ~ilc[in-package] is not an embedded event form, the only
  ~ilc[in-package] in a book is the initial one.  Because ~ilc[defpkg] is
  not an embedded event form, a book can never contain a ~ilc[defpkg]
  form.  Because ~ilc[include-book] is an embedded event form, ~il[books] may
  contain references to other ~il[books].  This makes ~il[books] structured
  objects.

  When the forms in a book are read from the file, they are read with
  ~ilc[current-package] set to the package named in the ~ilc[in-package]
  form at the top of the file.  The effect of this is that all symbols
  are ~il[intern]ed in that package, except those whose packages are given
  explicitly with the ``::'' notation.  For example, if a book begins
  with ~c[(in-package \"ACL2-X\")] and then contains the form
  ~bv[]
    (defun fn (x)
      (acl2::list 'car x))
  ~ev[]
  then ~ilc[defun], ~c[fn], ~c[x], and ~ilc[car] are all ~il[intern]ed in the
  ~c[\"ACL2-X\"] package.  I.e., it is as though the following form
  were read instead:
  ~bv[]
    (acl2-x::defun acl2-x::fn (acl2-x::x)
        (acl2::list 'acl2-x::car acl2-x::x)).
  ~ev[]
  Of course, ~c[acl2-x::defun] would be the same symbol as
  ~c[acl2::defun] if the ~c[\"ACL2-X\"] package imported ~c[acl2::defun].

  If each book has its own unique package name and all the names
  defined within the book are in that package, then name clashes
  between ~il[books] are completely avoided.  This permits the construction
  of useful logical ~il[world]s by the successive inclusion of many ~il[books].
  Although it is often too much trouble to manage several packages,
  their judicious use is a way to minimize name clashes.  Often, a
  better way is to use ~c[local]; ~pl[local].

  How does ~ilc[include-book] know the definitions of the packages used in a
  book, since ~ilc[defpkg]s cannot be among the forms?  More generally,
  how do we know that the forms in a book will be admissible in the
  host logical ~il[world] of an ~ilc[include-book]?  ~l[certificate] for
  answers to these questions.")

  how a book is known to be admissible and where its ~ilc[defpkg]s reside~/

  A book, say ~c[\"arith\"], is said to have a ``certificate'' if there
  is a file named ~c[\"arith.cert\"].  Certificates are created by the
  function ~ilc[certify-book] and inspected by ~ilc[include-book].  Check
  sums are used to help ensure that certificates are legitimate and
  that the corresponding book has not been modified since
  certification.  But because the file system is insecure and check
  sums are not perfect it is possible for the inclusion of a book to
  cause inconsistency even though the book carries an impeccable
  certificate.

  The certificate includes the version number of the certifying ACL2.
  A book is considered uncertified if it is included in an ACL2
  with a different ~il[version] number.~/

  The presence of a ``valid'' certificate file for a book attests to
  two things: all of the ~il[events] of the book are admissible in a
  certain extension of the initial ACL2 logic, and the non-~ilc[local]
  ~il[events] of the book are independent of the ~ilc[local] ones
  (~pl[local-incompatibility]).  In addition, the certificate
  contains the ~il[command]s used to construct the ~il[world] in which
  certification occurred.  Among those ~il[command]s, of course, are the
  ~ilc[defpkg]s defining the packages used in the book.  When a book is
  included into a host ~il[world], that ~il[world] is first extended
  by the ~il[command]s listed in the certificate for the book.  Unless that
  causes an error due to name conflicts, the extension ensures that
  all the packages used by the book are identically defined in the
  host ~il[world].

  ~em[Security:]

  Because the host file system is insecure, there is no way ACL2 can
  guarantee that the contents of a book remain the same as when its
  certificate was written.  That is, between the time a book is
  certified and the time it is used, it may be modified.  Furthermore,
  certificates can be counterfeited.  Check sums (~pl[check-sum])
  are used to help detect such problems.  But check sums provide
  imperfect security: two different files can have the same check sum.

  Therefore, from the strictly logical point of view, one must
  consider even the inclusion of certified ~il[books] as placing a burden
  on the user:~bq[]

  The non-erroneous inclusion of a certified book is consistency
  preserving provided (a) the objects read by ~ilc[include-book] from the
  certificate were the objects written there by a ~ilc[certify-book] and
  (b) the forms read by ~ilc[include-book] from the book itself are the
  forms read by the corresponding ~ilc[certify-book].

  ~eq[]We say that a given execution of ~ilc[include-book] is ``certified''
  if a certificate file for the book is present and well-formed and
  the check sum information contained within it supports the
  conclusion that the ~il[events] read by the ~ilc[include-book] are the ones
  checked by ~ilc[certify-book].  When an uncertified ~ilc[include-book]
  occurs, warnings are printed or errors are caused.  But even if no
  warning is printed, you must accept burdens (a) and (b) if you use
  ~il[books].  These burdens are easier to live with if you protect your
  ~il[books] so that other users cannot write to them, you abstain from
  running concurrent ACL2 jobs, and you abstain from counterfeiting
  certificates.  But even on a single user uniprocessor, you can shoot
  yourself in the foot by using the ACL2 ~il[io] primitives to fabricate an
  inconsistent book and the corresponding certificate.

  Note that part (a) of the burden described above implies, in
  particular, that there are no guarantees when a certificate is
  copied.  When ~il[books] are renamed (as by copying them), it is
  recommended that their certificates be removed and the ~il[books] be
  recertified.  The expectation is that recertification will go
  through without a hitch if relative ~il[pathname]s are used.
  ~l[pathname], which is not on the guided tour.

  Certificates essentially contain two parts, a ~il[portcullis] and a
  ~il[keep].  There is a third part, an ~c[expansion-alist], in order
  to record expansions if ~ilc[make-event] has been used, but the user
  need not be concerned with that level of detail.

;   Recall that we disallow ~ilc[include-book] ~il[events] from the portcullis

;   ~bv[]
;   ACL2 !>(~il[include-book] \"arith\")
;   ~ev[]
;   The problem here is that the file actually read on behalf of such

;   ~c[(include-book \"arith\")] into the portcullis of the book being

;   ~bv[]

  the gate guarding the entrance to a certified book~/

  The certificate (~pl[certificate] for general information) of a
  certified file is divided into two parts, a portcullis and a
  ~il[keep].  These names come from castle lore.  The portcullis of a
  castle is an iron grate that slides up through the ceiling of the
  tunnel-like entrance.  The portcullis of a book ensures that
  ~ilc[include-book] does not start to read the book until the
  appropriate context has been created.~/

  Technically, the portcullis consists of the ~il[version] number of
  the certifying ACL2, a list of ~il[command]s used to create the
  ``certification ~il[world]'' and an alist specifying the check sums
  of all the ~il[books] included in that ~il[world].  The portcullis
  is constructed automatically by ~ilc[certify-book] from the ~il[world]
  in which ~ilc[certify-book] is called, but that ~il[world] must have
  certain properties described below.  After listing the properties we
  discuss the issues in a more leisurely manner.

  Each ~il[command] in the portcullis must be either a ~ilc[defpkg] form or an
  embedded event form (~pl[embedded-event-form]).

  Consider a book to be certified.  The book is a file containing
  event forms.  Suppose the file contains references to such symbols
  as ~c[my-pkg::fn] and ~c[acl2-arith::cancel], but that the book itself
  does not create the packages.  Then a hard Lisp error would be
  caused merely by the attempt to read the expressions in the book.
  The corresponding ~ilc[defpkg]s cannot be written into the book itself
  because the book must be compilable and Common Lisp compilers differ
  on the rules concerning the inline definition of new packages.  The
  only safe course is to make all ~ilc[defpkg]s occur outside of compiled
  files.

  More generally, when a book is certified it is certified within some
  logical ~il[world].  That ``certification ~il[world]'' contains not only
  the necessary ~ilc[defpkg]s but also, perhaps, function and constant
  definitions and maybe even references to other ~il[books].  When
  ~ilc[certify-book] creates the ~il[certificate] for a file it recovers
  from the certification ~il[world] the ~il[command]s used to create that
  ~il[world] from the initial ACL2 ~il[world].  Those ~il[command]s become
  part of the portcullis for the certified book.  In addition,
  ~ilc[certify-book] records in the portcullis the check sums
  (~pl[check-sum]) of all the ~il[books] included in the certification
  ~il[world].

  ~ilc[Include-book] presumes that it is impossible even to read the
  contents of a certified book unless the portcullis can be
  ``raised.'' To raise the portcullis we must be able to execute
  (possibly redundantly, but certainly without error), all of the
  ~il[command]s in the portcullis and then verify that the ~il[books] thus
  included were identical to those used to build the certification
  ~il[world] (up to check sum).  This raising of the portcullis must
  be done delicately since ~ilc[defpkg]s are present: we cannot even read
  a ~il[command] in the portcullis until we have successfully executed the
  previous ones, since packages are being defined.

  Clearly, a book is most useful if it is certified in the most
  elementary extension possible of the initial logic.  If, for
  example, your certification ~il[world] happens to contain a
  ~ilc[defpkg] for ~c[\"MY-PKG\"] and the function ~c[foo], then those
  definitions become part of the portcullis for the book.  Every time
  the book is included, those names will be defined and will have to
  be either new or redundant (~pl[redundant-events]).  But if
  those names were not necessary to the certification of the book,
  their presence would unnecessarily restrict the utility of the book.

  ACL2 Version Number~/

  To determine the version number of your copy of ACL2, evaluate the form
  ~c[(@ acl2-version)].  The value will be a string.  For example,
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>(@ acl2-version)
  \"ACL2 Version 3.4\"
  ~ev[]
  ~/

  The part of the string after ~c[\"ACL2 Version \"] is of the form ~c[x.y] or
  ~c[x.y.z], optionally followed by a succession of values in parentheses,
  where ~c[x], ~c[y], and ~c[z] are natural numbers.  If ~c[z] is omitted then
  it is implicitly 0.  We refer to ~c[X], ~c[y], and ~c[z] as the ``major'',
  ``minor'', and ``incrl'' fields, respectively.  The incrl field is used for
  incremental releases.  The discussion just below assumes that incremental
  releases are not employed at the user's site, i.e., the incrl fields are
  always 0.  We remove this assumption when we discuss incremental releases at
  the end of this documenttation topic.

  ~il[Books] are considered certified only in the same version of ACL2
  in which the certification was done.  The ~il[certificate] file
  records the version number of the certifying ACL2 and
  ~il[include-book] considers the book uncertified if that does not
  match the current version number.  Thus, each time we release a new
  version of ACL2, previously certified books should be recertified.

  Note that there are over 150 constants in the system, most having to do with
  the fact that ACL2 is coded in ACL2.  Many of these, for example
  ~c[*common-lisp-specials-and-constants*] and ~c[*acl2-exports*], may change
  from version to version, and this can cause unsoundness.  For example, the
  symbol ~c['set-difference-eq] was added to ~c[*acl2-exports*] in Version_2.9,
  so we can certify a book in Version_2.8 containing the following theorem,
  which is false in Version_2.9.
  ~bv[]
  (null (member 'set-difference-eq *acl2-exports*))
  ~ev[]
  Therefore, we need to disallow inclusion of such a book in a Version_2.9
  session, which otherwise would allow us to prove ~c[nil].  Furthermore, it is
  possible that from one version of the system to another we might change, say,
  the default values on some system function or otherwise make ``intentional''
  changes to the axioms.  It is even possible one version of the system is
  discovered to be unsound and we release a new version to correct our error.

  Therefore we adopted the draconian policy that books are certified
  by a given version of ACL2 and ``must'' be recertified to be used
  in other versions.  We put ``must'' in quotes because in fact, ACL2
  allows a book that was certified in one ACL2 version to be included
  in a later version, using ~ilc[include-book].  But ACL2 does not allow
  ~ilc[certify-book] to succeed when such an ~ilc[include-book] is executed on its
  behalf.  Also, you may experience undesirable behavior if you avoid
  recertification when moving to a different version.  Hence we
  recommend that you stick to the draconion policy of recertifying
  books when updating to a new ACL2 version.

  The string ~c[(@ acl2-version)] can contain implementation-specific
  information in addition to the version number.  For example, in
  Macintosh Common Lisp (MCL) ~c[(char-code #\Newline)] is 13, while as
  far as we know, it is 10 in every other Common Lisp.  Our concern is
  that one could certify a book in an MCL-based ACL2 with the theorem
  ~bv[]
  (equal (char-code #\Newline) 13)
  ~ev[]
  and then include this book in another Lisp and thereby prove ~c[nil].
  So, when a book is certified in an MCL-based ACL2, the book's
  ~il[certificate] mentions ``MCL'' in its version string.  Moreover,
  ~c[(@ acl2-version)] similarly mentions ``MCL'' when the ACL2 image has
  been built on top of MCL.  Thus, an attempt to include a book in an
  MCL-based ACL2 that was certified in a non-MCL-based ACL2, or
  vice-versa, will be treated like an attempt to include an
  uncertified book.

  ~em[Incremental releases.]

  From time to time, so-called ``incremental releases'' of ACL2 are made
  available.  These releases are thoroughly tested on at least two platforms;
  ``normal'' releases, on the other hand, are thoroughly tested on many more
  platforms (perhaps a dozen or so) and are accompanied by updates to the ACL2
  home page.  We provide incremental releases in order to provide timely
  updates for ACL2 users who want them, without imposing unnecessary burdens on
  either on the ACL2 implementors or on ACL2 users who prefer to update less
  frequently.  The implementors expect users to update their copies of ACL2
  when normal releases are made available, but not necessarily when incremental
  releases are made available.

  Incremental releases are accompanied by a bump in the incrl field of the
  version field, while normal releases are accompanied by a bump in the minor
  or (much less frequently) major field and zeroing out of the incrl field.
  Note that incremental releases are full-fledged releases.~/")

  how we know if ~ilc[include-book] read the correct files~/

  The certificate (~pl[certificate] for general information) of a

  and usually tallest tower of a castle from which the entire
  courtyard can be surveyed by the defenders.  The keep of a book is a
  list of file names and check sums used after the book has been
  included, to determine if the files read were (up to check sum)
  those certified.~/

  Once the ~il[portcullis] is open, ~ilc[include-book] can enter the book
  and read the event forms therein.  The non-~ilc[local] event forms are
  in fact executed, extending the host theory.  That may read in other
  ~il[books].  When that has been finished, the keep of the
  ~il[certificate] is inspected.  The keep is a list of the book names
  which are included (hereditarily through all subbooks) in the
  certified book (including the certified book itself) together with
  the check sums of the objects in those ~il[books] at the time of
  certification.  We compare the check sums of the ~il[books] just included

  invalid ~il[certificate]s and uncertified ~il[books]~/

  For relevant background ~pl[books], ~pl[certificate], and ~pl[portcullis].

  ~ilc[Include-book] has a special provision for dealing with an uncertified
  book, i.e., a file with no ~il[certificate] or an invalid
  ~il[certificate] (i.e., one whose check sums describe files other than the
  ones actually read).  In this case, a warning is printed and the book is
  otherwise processed much as though it were certified and had an open
  ~il[portcullis].

  If a book ~c[B.lisp] is uncertified and a file ~c[B.port] exists, then the
  forms in ~c[B.port] are evaluated before the forms in ~c[B.lisp].  Such a
  file ~c[B.port] is typically created calling ~ilc[certify-book] on book
  ~c[\"B\"] with argument ~c[:write-port t], so that ~c[B.port] contains the
  ~il[portcullis] ~il[command]s for ~c[B] (the commands present in the
  ~il[world] when that certification was attempted).

  Inclusion of uncertified books can be handy, but it can have disastrous
  consequences.~/

  The provision allowing uncertified ~il[books] to be included can have
  disastrous consequences, ranging from hard lisp errors, to damaged memory, to
  quiet logical inconsistency.

  It is possible for the inclusion of an uncertified book to render the logic
  inconsistent.  For example, one of its non-~ilc[local] ~il[events] might be
  ~c[(defthm t-is-nil (equal t nil))].  It is also possible for the inclusion
  of an uncertified book to cause hard errors or ~il[breaks] into raw Common
  Lisp.  For example, if the file has been edited since it was certified, it
  may contain too many open parentheses, causing Lisp to read past ``end of
  file.'' Similarly, it might contain non-ACL2 objects such as ~c[3.1415] or
  ill-formed event forms that cause ACL2 code to break.

  Even if a book is perfectly well formed and could be certified (in a suitable
  extension of ACL2's initial ~il[world]), its uncertified inclusion might
  cause Lisp errors or inconsistencies!  For example, it might mention packages
  that do not exist in the host ~il[world], especially if the ~c[.port] file
  (discussed above) does not exist from an earlier certification attempt.  The
  ~il[portcullis] of a certified book ensures that the correct ~ilc[defpkg]s
  have been admitted, but if a book is read without actually raising its
  ~il[portcullis], symbols in the file, e.g., ~c[acl2-arithmetic::fn], could
  cause ``unknown package'' errors in Common Lisp.  Perhaps the most subtle
  disaster occurs if the host ~il[world] does have a ~ilc[defpkg] for each
  package used in the book but the host ~ilc[defpkg] imports different symbols
  than those required by the ~il[portcullis].  In this case, it is possible
  that formulas which were theorems in the certified book are non-theorems in
  the host ~il[world], but those formulas can be read without error and will
  then be quietly assumed.

  In short, if you include an uncertified book, ~st[all bets are off] regarding
  the validity of the future behavior of ACL2.

  That said, it should be noted that ACL2 is pretty tough and if errors don't
  occur, the chances are that deductions after the inclusion of an uncertified
  book are probably justified in the (possibly inconsistent) logical extension
  obtained by assuming the admissibility and validity of the definitions and
  conjectures in the book.")

  makefile support provided with the ACL2 community books~/

  This topic describes the ACL2 methodology for using makefiles to assist in
  the automation of the certification of collections of ACL2 ~il[books].  We
  assume here a familiarity with Unix/Linux ~c[make].  We also assume that you
  are using GNU ~c[make] rather than some other flavor of ~c[make].  And
  finally, we generally assume, as is typically the case by following the
  standard installation instructions, that you install the ACL2 community books
  in the ~c[books/] subdirectory of your ACL2 distribution.

  See the end of this topic for a list of troubleshooting notes.  Please feel
  free to suggest additions to that list!

  The basic idea is to stand in the ACL2 sources directory and submit the
  following command, in order to certify all the ~il[books].
  ~bv[]
  make regression
  ~ev[]
  For each book ~c[foo.lisp], a file ~c[foo.out] in the same directory will
  contain the output from the corresponding certification attempt.  If you have
  previous executed such a command, then you will first want to delete
  ~il[certificate] files and other generated files, either by first executing
  ~c[make clean-books] or simply by submitting the following command.
  ~bv[]
  make regression-fresh
  ~ev[]

  By default, the ACL2 executable used is the file ~c[saved_acl2] in the ACL2
  sources directory.  But you can specify another instead; indeed, you must do
  so if you are using an experimental extension (~pl[real],
  ~pl[hons-and-memoization], and ~pl[parallelism]):
  ~bv[]
  make regression ACL2=<your_favorite_acl2_executable>
  ~ev[]

  If you have a multi-processor machine or the like, then you can use the
  ~c[ACL2_JOBS] variable to obtain ~c[make]-level parallelism by specifying the
  number of concurrent processes.  The following example shows how to specify 8
  concurrent processes.  Note that we avoid using the customary `make' option
  for concurrent processes, in this case `-j 8', because part of the regression
  (under the ~c[centaur/] community books directory) would fail to take
  advantage of that directive.
  ~bv[]
  make ACL2_JOBS=8 regression
  ~ev[]
  Note that while other environment and `make' variables discussed here are
  also appropriate for use by suitable calls of `make' in the community books
  directory, ~c[ACL2_JOBS] is only suitable for use with the ~c[regression]
  target (and similar targets, such as ~c[regression-fresh]) in the ACL2
  sources directory).

  You can also specify just the directories you want, among those offered in
  ~c[Makefile].  For example:
  ~bv[]
  make -j 8 regression ACL2_BOOK_DIRS='symbolic paco'
  ~ev[]

  By default, your acl2-customization file (~pl[acl2-customization]) is ignored
  by all such flavors of ``~c[make regression]''.  However, you can specify the
  use of an acl2-customization file by setting the value of environment
  variable ~c[ACL2_CUSTOMIZATION] to the empty string, indicating a default
  such file, or to the desired absolute pathname.  For example:
  ~bv[]
  make regression ACL2_CUSTOMIZATION=''
  make regression ACL2_CUSTOMIZATION='~~/acl2-customization.lisp'
  ~ev[]

  The `make' commands displayed above all use the makefile, ~c[GNUmakefile],
  that resides in the ACL2 sources directory.

  We now discuss how to create suitable makefiles in individual directories
  that contain certifiable ~il[books].~/

  ACL2's regression suite is typically run on the community books, using
  ~c[Makefile]s that include community books file ~c[books/Makefile-generic].
  You can look at existing ~c[Makefile]s to understand how to create your own
  ~c[Makefile]s.  Here are the six steps to follow to create a ~c[Makefile] for
  a directory that contains books to be certified, and certify them using that
  ~c[Makefile].  Below these steps we conclude with discussion of other
  capabilties provided by ~c[books/Makefile-generic].

  1. It is most common to use an ACL2 executable named ~c[saved_acl2] that
  resides in the parent directory of the ~c[books/] directory.  In
  this case, unless you are using a very old version of GNU ~c[make] (version
  3.80, at least, works fine), you should be able to skip the following sentence,
  because the ~c[ACL2] `~c[make]' variable will be set automatically.
  Otherwise, define the ~c[ACL2] variable using ~c[?=] to point to your ACL2 executable
  (though this may be omitted for directories directly under the ~c[books/]
  directory), for example:
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 ?= ../../../saved_acl2
  ~ev[]
  (For Makefile experts: we use ~c[?=] instead of ~c[=] or ~c[:=] because of
  the protocol used by the ACL2 ~c[make] system: command-line values are passed
  explicitly with recursive calls of ~c[make] to override the Makefile values
  of ~c[ACL2], which in turn need to be able to override the environment value
  of ~c[ACL2] from ~c[books/Makefile-generic]).

  Also include the file ~c[Makefile-generic] in the ~c[books/] directory.  For
  example, community books file ~c[books/arithmetic-3/pass1/Makefile] starts as
  follows.
  ~bv[]
  include ../../Makefile-generic
  ~ev[]
  If you also have a line defining ~c[ACL2] as explained above, put that line
  just above this ~c[include] line.

  2. (Optional; usually skipped.)  Set the ~c[INHIBIT] variable if you want to
  see more than the summary output.  For example, if you want to see the same
  output as you would normally see at the terminal, put this line in your
  Makefile after the `~c[ACL2 ?=]' and ~~c[include]' lines.
  ~bv[]
  INHIBIT = (assign inhibit-output-lst (list (quote proof-tree)))
  ~ev[]
  For other values to use for ~c[INHIBIT], ~pl[set-inhibit-output-lst] and see
  the original setting of ~c[INHIBIT] in ~c[books/Makefile-generic].

  3. Specify the books to be certified.  If every file with extension ~c[.lisp]
  is a book that you want to certify, you can skip this step.  Otherwise, put a
  line in your ~c[Makefile] after the ones above that specifies the books to be
  certified.  The following example, from an old version of community books file
  ~c[books/finite-set-theory/osets/Makefile], should make this clear.
  ~bv[]
  BOOKS = computed-hints fast instance map membership outer primitives \\
          quantify set-order sets sort
  ~ev[]
  But better yet, use the extension ~c[.lsp] for any Lisp or ACL2 files that
  are not to be certified, so that the definition of ~c[BOOKS] can be omitted.

  4. Create ~c[.acl2] files for books that are to be certified in other than
  the initial ACL2 world (~pl[portcullis]).  For example, if you look in
  community books file ~c[books/arithmetic/equalities.acl2] you will see
  ~ilc[defpkg] forms followed by a ~ilc[certify-book] command, because it was
  determined that ~ilc[defpkg] forms were necessary in the certification world
  in order to certify the ~c[equalities] book.  In general, for each
  ~c[<book-name>.lisp] whose certification requires a non-initial certification
  world, you will need a corresponding ~c[<book-name>.acl2] file that ends with
  the appropriate ~ilc[certify-book] command.  Of course, you can also use
  ~c[.acl2] files with initial certification worlds, for example if you want to
  pass optional arguments to ~ilc[certify-book].

  You also have the option of creating a file ~c[cert.acl2] that has a special
  role.  When file ~c[<book-name>.lisp] is certified, if there is no file
  ~c[<book-name>.acl2] but there is a file ~c[cert.acl2], then ~c[cert.acl2]
  will be used as ~c[<book-name>.acl2] would have been used, as described in
  the preceding paragraph, except that the appropriate ~ilc[certify-book]
  command will be generated automatically ~-[] no ~c[certify-book] command
  should occur in ~c[cert.acl2].

  It is actually allowed to put raw lisp forms in a ~c[.acl2] file (presumably
  preceded by ~c[:q] or ~c[(value :q)] and followed by ~c[(lp)]).  But this is
  not recommended; we make no guarantees about certification performed any time
  after raw Lisp has been entered in the ACL2 session.

  5. Generally, the next step is to include the following line after the
  `~c[include]' of ~c[Makefile-generic] (see the first step above).
  ~bv[]
  -include Makefile-deps
  ~ev[]
  This will cause `~c[make]' to create and then include a file
  ~c[Makefile-deps] that contains ``dependency'' lines needed by ~c[make].
  If those dependencies are somehow flawed, it may be because you have
  ~ilc[include-book] forms that are not truly including books, for example in
  multi-line comments (~c[#|..|#]).  These will be ignored if preceded by a
  semicolon (~c[;]), or if you add a line break after ``~c[include-book].''
  But instead, you can create dependency lines yourself by running the command
  ~bv[]
  make dependencies
  ~ev[]
  and pasting the result into the end of your ~c[Makefile], and editing as you
  see fit.

  6. Run ~c[make].  This will generate a ~c[<book-name>.out] file for each
  ~c[<book-name>.lisp] file being certified, which is the result of redirecting
  ACL2's standard output.  Note that ~c[make] will stop at the first failure,
  but you can use ~c[make -i] to force make to continue past failures.  You can
  also use the ~c[-j] option to speed things up if you have a multi-core
  machine, e.g., ~c[make -j 8] in a book directory or, if in the ACL2 sources
  directory, ~c[make -j 8 regression].

  This concludes the basic instructions for creating a ~c[Makefile] in a
  directory including books.  Here are some other capabilities offered by
  community books file ~c[books/Makefile-subdirs].  Not included below is a
  discussion of how to increase parallelism by avoiding the need to certify
  included books before certifying a given book;
  ~pl[provisional-certification].

  ~st[Subdirectory support.]  There is support for subdirectories.  For
  example, community books file ~c[books/arithmetic-3/Makefile] formerly had
  the following contents.
  ~bv[]
  DIRS = pass1 bind-free floor-mod
  include ../Makefile-subdirs
  ~ev[]
  This indicated that we are to run ~c[make] in subdirectories ~c[pass1/],
  ~c[bind-free/], and ~c[floor-mod] of the current directory (namely, community
  books directory ~c[books/arithmetic-3/]).

  However, there is also subdirectory support when the current directory has
  books as well.  Community books file ~c[books/arithmetic-3/Makefile] contains
  the following lines (at least as of ACL2 Version_3.6).
  ~bv[]
  arith-top: top all
  all: top

  DIRS = pass1 bind-free floor-mod
  include ../Makefile-subdirs
  include ../Makefile-generic

  -include Makefile-deps
  ~ev[]
  The first line is optional because ~c[../../saved_acl2] is the default and
  the directory is a sub-sub-directory of the distribution directory; but it is
  harmless to include this line.  The other additional lines support certifying
  books in the subdirectories before certifying the books in the present
  directory, in the customary ~c[make] style.

  Specifically, the ~c[top] target is defined in ~c[../Makefile-subdirs] to
  call ~c[make] in each subdirectory in ~c[DIRS].  We have set the default
  target in the example above to a new name, ~c[arith-top], that makes that
  ~c[top] target before making the ~c[all] target.  The ~c[all] target, in
  turn, is the top (default) target in ~c[../Makefile-generic], and is
  responsible for certifying books in the current directory.

  Use ~c[Makefile-psubdirs] instead of ~c[Makefile-subdirs] if certification
  of a book in a subdirectory never depends on certification of a book in a
  different subdirectory, because then ~c[make]'s ~c[-j] option can allow
  subdirectories to be processed in parallel.

  ~st[Cleaning up.]  We note that there is a ~c[clean] target.  Thus,
  ~bv[]
  make clean
  ~ev[]
  will remove generated files including ~c[.cert] files, ~c[.port files]
  (~pl[uncertified-books]), ~c[.acl2x] files (if any), files resulting from
  compilation, and other ``junk''; see the full list under ``~c[clean:]'' in
  ~c[books/Makefile-generic].

  ~st[System books.] An environment variable ~c[ACL2_SYSTEM_BOOKS] is generally
  set automatically (at least in GNU make versions 3.80 and 3.81), so you can
  probably skip reading the following paragraph unless your attempt to certify
  books fails to locate those books properly.

  The environment variable ~c[ACL2_SYSTEM_BOOKS] can be set to the ~c[books/]
  directory under which the books reside, typically the ACL2 community books.  A
  Unix-style pathname, typically ending in ~c[books/] or ~c[books], is
  permissible.  In most cases, your ACL2 executable is a small script in which
  you can set this environment variable just above the line on which the actual
  ACL2 image is invoked, for example:
  ~bv[]
  export ACL2_SYSTEM_BOOKS
  ACL2_SYSTEM_BOOKS=/home/acl2/v3-2/acl2-sources/books
  ~ev[]
  However, you can also set ~c[ACL2_SYSTEM_BOOKS] as a ~c[make] variable, by
  setting it in your ~c[Makefile] before the first target definition, e.g.:
  ~bv[]
  ACL2_SYSTEM_BOOKS = /home/acl2/v3-2/acl2-sources/books
  ~ev[]

  ~st[Compilation support.]  The file ~c[books/Makefile-generic] provides
  support for compiling books that are already certified (but ~pl[compilation]
  for an exception).  For example, suppose that you have certified books in
  GCL, resulting in compiled files with the ~c[.o] extension.  Now suppose you
  would like to compile the books for Allegro Common Lisp, whose compiled files
  have the ~c[.fasl] extension.  The following command will work if you have
  included ~c[books/Makefile-generic] in your ~c[Makefile].
  ~bv[]
  make fasl
  ~ev[]
  In general, the compiled file extension for a Lisp supported by ACL2 will be
  a target name for building compiled files for all your books (after
  certifying the books, if not already up-to-date on certification).

  ~st[Troubleshooting notes.]  Please feel free to suggest additions and
  changes!

  (1) PROBLEM: Regression fails early for community books, perhaps because of
  Perl.  (For example, a Windows system has encountered such difficulty even
  after installing Perl.)
  ~bq[]
  Solution: Skip certification of the ~c[centaur/] books by including
  ~c[ACL2_CENTAUR=skip] with your `~c[make]' command.  For example:
  ~bv[]
  make regression-fresh ACL2_CENTAUR=skip
  ~ev[]
  ~eq[]

  (2) PROBLEM: The first part of the regression doesn't seem to be going in
  parallel, even though I supplied a ~c[-j] option in my `~c[make]' command.
  ~bq[]
  Solution: Set ~c[ACL2_JOBS] to the number of jobs instead of using ~c[-j].
  For example:
  ~bv[]
  make ACL2_JOBS=8 regression-fresh
  ~ev[]
  ~eq[]")

  running regressions using the ACL2 community books~/

  Here we provide a concise summary of how to certify the ACL2 community books
  when you install ACL2.  For more information about installing ACL2, see the
  installation instructions, either by following a link from the ACL2 home page
  or by going directly to the page
  ~url[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/current/installation/installation.html].
  For more information about the ACL2 community books and how to certify them,
  ~pl[community-books] and ~pl[book-makefiles].

  ~st[The Basics]

  We assume that you have built or obtained an ACL2 executable, that the ACL2
  community books are in subdirectory ~c[books/], and that you are standing in
  the ACL2 sources directory.  If you built that executable, then by default
  its name is ~c[saved_acl2], and you can issue the following command to the
  shell.
  ~bv[]
    make regression
  ~ev[]
  Better yet, save a log file in case there are problems, for example
  ~bv[]
    (make regression) >& make-regression.log
  ~ev[]
  or perhaps better yet:
  ~bv[]
    (time nice make regression) >& make-regression.log
  ~ev[]
  For the sake of brevity, below we'll skip mentioning any of `~c[time]',
  `~c[nice]', or `~c[>& make-regression.log]'; but we do generally recommend
  using these as shown above.

  Such a certification run may take a few hours, but if you have a
  multiprocessing computer, you can speed it up by specifying a value for
  ~c[ACL2_JOBS].  For example, if you have 8 hardware threads then you might
  want to issue the following command.
  ~bv[]
    make regression ACL2_JOBS=8
  ~ev[]
  Warning: if instead you use `~c[make -j 8 regression]', you will not see
  parallel certification for books in the ~c[centaur/] directory.~/

  ~st[Specifying the ACL2 Executable]

  If your ACL2 executable is not file ~c[saved_acl2] in the ACL2 sources
  directory, then you will need to specify that executable.  You can do that by
  setting variable ~c[ACL2], either as an environment variable or, as displayed
  below, as a `~c[make]' variable.  Either way, you will need to avoid relative
  pathnames.  For example, the first two forms below are legal, but the third
  is not, assuming that ~c[my-acl2] is on your ~c[PATH] in a Unix-like
  environment (e.g., linux or MacOS) and that ~c[my-saved_acl2] is just a
  pathname relative to your ACL2 sources directory, which is not on your path.
  ~bv[]
    make regression ACL2_JOBS=8 ACL2=my-acl2
    make regression ACL2_JOBS=8 ACL2=/u/smith/bin/acl2
    # The following is unlikely to work (see above).
    make regression ACL2_JOBS=8 ACL2=my-saved_acl2
  ~ev[]

  ~st[Regressions for Experimental Extensions of ACL2]

  The instructions are similar if you are using ACL2(h), the experimental
  extension supporting hash-cons, function memoization, and fast alists
  (~pl[hons-and-memoization]).  However, in that case you should use target
  ~c[regression-hons] in place of target ~c[regression], which will include
  directories that depend on ACL2(h) features not present in ACL2, and which
  will use ~c[saved_acl2h] instead of ~c[saved_acl2] as the default executable
  name.  So for example:
  ~bv[]
    make ACL2_JOBS=8 regression-hons
  ~ev[]

  If you wish to use ACL2(p), the extension of ACL2 that supports parallel
  proof and execution (~pl[parallelism]), then we recommend that you use ACL2
  for your regression as discussed above.  Then you can use ACL2(p) for your
  own proof developments.  (The analogous comment applies to ACL2(hp) and
  ACL2(h), i.e., to the use of parallelism on top of ACL2(h).)

  ~c[books/nonstd] using ACL2(r).

  ~st[Troubleshooting]

  If your system has difficulty certifying the books in the ~c[centaur/]
  directory, say because of issues with Perl, you can skip them by
  specifying ~c[ACL2_CENTAUR=skip], for example as follows.
  ~bv[]
    make regression ACL2_CENTAUR=skip
  ~ev[]
  (But this should't be necessary, so please email the ACL2 implementors if
  that happens!)

(defun defchoose-constraint-extra (fn bound-vars formals body)

; WARNING: If the following comment is removed, then eliminate the reference to
; it in :doc defchoose.

; Note that :doc conservativity-of-defchoose contains an argument showing that
; we may assume that there is a definable enumeration, enum, of the universe.
; Thus, for any definable property that is not always false, there is a "least"
; witness, i.e., a least n for which (enum n) satisfies that property.  Thus, a
; function defined with defchoose is definable: pick the least witness if there
; is one, else nil.  From this definition it is clear that the following
; formula holds, where formals2 is a copy of formals that is disjoint both from
; formals and from bound-vars, and where tbody2 is the result of replacing
; formals by formals2 in tbody, the translated body of the defchoose.  (If
; bound-vars is a list of length 1, then we use let rather than mv-let in this
; formula.)

; (or (equal (fn . formals)
;            (fn . formals2))
;     (mv-let (bound-vars (fn . formals))
;       (and tbody
;            (not tbody2)))
;     (mv-let (bound-vars (fn . formals2))
;       (and tbody2
;            (not tbody1))))

; We now outline an argument for the :non-standard-analysis case, which in fact
; provides justification for both defchoose axioms.  The idea is to assume that
; there is a suitable well-ordering for the ground-zero theory and that the
; ground-zero theory contains enough "invisible" functions so that this
; property is preserved by extensions (as discussed in the JAR paper "Theory
; Extensions in ACL2(r) by Gamboa and Cowles).  Here is a little more detail,
; but a nice challenge is to work this out completely.

; The idea of the proof is first to start with what the above paper calls an
; "r-complete" GZ: basically, a ground-zero theory satisfying induction and
; transfer that contains a function symbol for each defun and defun-std.  We
; can preserve r-completeness as we add defun, defun-std, encapsulate, and
; defchoose events (again, as in the above paper).  The key idea for defchoose
; is that GZ should also have a binary symbol, <|, that is axiomatized to be a
; total order.  That is, <| is a "definable well order", in the sense that
; there are axioms that guarantee for each phi(x) that (exists x phi) implies
; that (exists <|-least x phi).  The trick is to add the well-ordering after
; taking a nonstandard elementary extension of the standard reals MS, where
; every function over the reals is represented in MS as the interpretation of a
; function symbol.

; Still as in the above paper, there is a definable fn for the above defchoose,
; obtained by picking the least witness.  Moreover, if body is classical then
; we can first conjoin it with (standard-p bound-var), choose the <|-least
; bound-var with a classical function using defun-std, and then show by
; transfer that this function witnesses the original defchoose.

  General Form:
  (defun-sk fn (var1 ... varn) body
    &key rewrite doc quant-ok skolem-name thm-name witness-dcls strengthen)
  ~ev[]
  where ~c[fn] is the symbol you wish to define and is a new symbolic
  name (~pl[name]), ~c[(var1 ... varn)] is its list of formal
  parameters (~pl[name]), and ~c[body] is its body, which must be
  quantified as described below.  The ~c[&key] argument ~ilc[doc] is an optional
  ~il[documentation] string to be associated with ~c[fn]; for a description
  of its form, ~pl[doc-string].  In the case that ~c[n] is 1, the list
  ~c[(var1)] may be replaced by simply ~c[var1].  The other arguments are
  explained below.

  For a simple example, ~pl[defun-sk-example].  For a more elaborate example,
  ~pl[Tutorial4-Defun-Sk-Example].  ~l[quantifier-tutorial] for a careful
  beginner's introduction that takes you through typical kinds of
  quantifier-based reasoning in ACL2.  Also ~pl[quantifiers] for an example
  illustrating how the use of recursion, rather than explicit quantification
  with ~c[defun-sk], may be preferable.

  Below we describe the ~c[defun-sk] event precisely.  First, let us
  consider the examples above.  The first example, again, is:
  ~bv[]
  (defun-sk exists-x-p0-and-q0 (y z)
    (exists x
            (and (p0 x y z)
                 (q0 x y z))))
  ~ev[]
  It is intended to represent the predicate with formal parameters ~c[y]
  and ~c[z] that holds when for some ~c[x], ~c[(and (p0 x y z) (q0 x y z))]
  holds.  In fact ~c[defun-sk] is a macro that adds the following two
  ~il[events], as shown just below.  The first event guarantees that if
  this new predicate holds of ~c[y] and ~c[z], then the term shown,
  ~c[(exists-x-p0-and-q0-witness y z)], is an example of the ~c[x] that is
  therefore supposed to exist.  (Intuitively, we are axiomatizing
  ~c[exists-x-p0-and-q0-witness] to pick a witness if there is one.
  We comment below on the use of ~ilc[defun-nx]; for now, consider ~c[defun-nx]
  to be ~ilc[defun].)  Conversely, the second event below guarantees that if
  there is any ~c[x] for which the term in question holds, then the new
  predicate does indeed hold of ~c[y] and ~c[z].
  ~bv[]
  (defun-nx exists-x-p0-and-q0 (y z)
    (let ((x (exists-x-p0-and-q0-witness y z)))
      (and (p0 x y z) (q0 x y z))))
  (defthm exists-x-p0-and-q0-suff
    (implies (and (p0 x y z) (q0 x y z))
             (exists-x-p0-and-q0 y z)))
  ~ev[]
  Now let us look at the third example from the introduction above:
  ~bv[]
  (defun-sk forall-x-y-p0-and-q0 (z)
    (forall (x y)
            (and (p0 x y z)
                 (q0 x y z))))
  ~ev[]
  The intention is to introduce a new predicate
  ~c[(forall-x-y-p0-and-q0 z)] which states that the indicated conjunction
  holds of all ~c[x] and all ~c[y] together with the given ~c[z].  This time, the
  axioms introduced are as shown below.  The first event guarantees
  that if the application of function ~c[forall-x-y-p0-and-q0-witness] to
  ~c[z] picks out values ~c[x] and ~c[y] for which the given term
  ~c[(and (p0 x y z) (q0 x y z))] holds, then the new predicate
  ~c[forall-x-y-p0-and-q0] holds of ~c[z].  Conversely, the (contrapositive
  of) the second axiom guarantees that if the new predicate holds of
  ~c[z], then the given term holds for all choices of ~c[x] and ~c[y] (and that
  same ~c[z]). 
  ~bv[]
  (defun-nx forall-x-y-p0-and-q0 (z)
    (mv-let (x y)
            (forall-x-y-p0-and-q0-witness z)
            (and (p0 x y z) (q0 x y z))))
  (defthm forall-x-y-p0-and-q0-necc
    (implies (not (and (p0 x y z) (q0 x y z)))
             (not (forall-x-y-p0-and-q0 z))))
  ~ev[]
  The examples above suggest the critical property of ~c[defun-sk]:  it
  indeed does introduce the quantified notions that it claims to
  introduce.

  Notice that the ~ilc[defthm] event just above, ~c[forall-x-y-p0-and-q0-necc],
  may not be of optimal form as a rewrite rule.  Users sometimes find that when
  the quantifier is ~c[forall], it is useful to state this rule in a form where
  the new quantified predicate is a hypothesis instead.  In this case that form
  would be as follows:
  ~bv[]
  (defthm forall-x-y-p0-and-q0-necc
    (implies (forall-x-y-p0-and-q0 z)
             (and (p0 x y z) (q0 x y z))))
  ~ev[]
  ACL2 will turn this into one ~c[:]~ilc[rewrite] rule for each conjunct,
  ~c[(p0 x y z)] and ~c[(q0 x y z)], with hypothesis
  ~c[(forall-x-y-p0-and-q0 z)] in each case.  In order to get this effect, use
  ~c[:rewrite :direct], in this case as follows.
  ~bv[]
  (defun-sk forall-x-y-p0-and-q0 (z)
    (forall (x y)
            (and (p0 x y z)
                 (q0 x y z)))
    :rewrite :direct)
  ~ev[]

  We now turn to a detailed description of ~c[defun-sk], starting with a
  discussion of its arguments as shown in the \"General Form\" above.

  The third argument, ~c[body], must be of the form
  ~bv[]
  (Q bound-vars term)
  ~ev[]
  where:  ~c[Q] is the symbol ~ilc[forall] or ~ilc[exists] (in the \"ACL2\"
  package), ~c[bound-vars] is a variable or true list of variables
  disjoint from ~c[(var1 ... varn)] and not including ~ilc[state], and
  ~c[term] is a term.  The case that ~c[bound-vars] is a single variable
  ~c[v] is treated exactly the same as the case that ~c[bound-vars] is
  ~c[(v)].

  The result of this event is to introduce a ``Skolem function,'' whose name is
  the keyword argument ~c[skolem-name] if that is supplied, and otherwise is
  the result of modifying ~c[fn] by suffixing \"-WITNESS\" to its name.  The
  following definition and one of the following two theorems (as indicated) are
  introduced for ~c[skolem-name] and ~c[fn] in the case that ~c[bound-vars]
  (see above) is a single variable ~c[v].  The name of the ~ilc[defthm] event
  may be supplied as the value of the keyword argument ~c[:thm-name]; if it is
  not supplied, then it is the result of modifying ~c[fn] by suffixing
  \"-SUFF\" to its name in the case that the quantifier is ~ilc[exists], and
  \"-NECC\" in the case that the quantifier is ~ilc[forall].
  ~bv[]
  (defun-nx fn (var1 ... varn)
    (let ((v (skolem-name var1 ... varn)))
      term))

  (defthm fn-suff ;in case the quantifier is EXISTS
    (implies term
             (fn var1 ... varn)))

  (defthm fn-necc ;in case the quantifier is FORALL
    (implies (not term)
             (not (fn var1 ... varn))))
  ~ev[]

  In the ~c[forall] case, however, the keyword pair ~c[:rewrite :direct] may be
  supplied after the body of the ~c[defun-sk] form, in which case the
  contrapositive of the above form is used instead:
  ~bv[]
  (defthm fn-necc ;in case the quantifier is FORALL
    (implies (fn var1 ... varn)
             term))
  ~ev[]
  This is often a better choice for the \"-NECC\" rule, provided ACL2 can parse
  ~c[term] as a ~c[:]~ilc[rewrite] rule.  A second possible value of the
  ~c[:rewrite] argument of ~c[defun-sk] is ~c[:default], which gives the same
  behavior as when ~c[:rewrite] is omitted.  Otherwise, the value of
  ~c[:rewrite] should be the term to use as the body of the ~c[fn-necc] theorem
  shown above; ACL2 will attempt to do the requisite proof in this case.  If
  that term is weaker than the default, the properties introduced by
  ~c[defun-sk] may of course be weaker than they would be otherwise.  Finally,
  note that the ~c[:rewrite] keyword argument for ~c[defun-sk] only makes sense
  if the quantifier is ~c[forall]; it is thus illegal if the quantifier is
  ~c[exists].  Enough said about ~c[:rewrite]!

  In the case that ~c[bound-vars] is a list of at least two variables, say
  ~c[(bv1 ... bvk)], the definition above (with no keywords) is the following
  instead, but the theorem remains unchanged.
  ~bv[]
  (defun-nx fn (var1 ... varn)
    (mv-let (bv1 ... bvk)
            (skolem-name var1 ... varn)
            term))
  ~ev[]

  In order to emphasize that the last element of the list, ~c[body], is a
  term, ~c[defun-sk] checks that the symbols ~ilc[forall] and ~ilc[exists] do
  not appear anywhere in it.  However, on rare occasions one might
  deliberately choose to violate this convention, presumably because
  ~ilc[forall] or ~ilc[exists] is being used as a variable or because a
  macro call will be eliminating ``calls of'' ~ilc[forall] and ~ilc[exists].
  In these cases, the keyword argument ~c[quant-ok] may be supplied a
  non-~c[nil] value.  Then ~c[defun-sk] will permit ~ilc[forall] and
  ~ilc[exists] in the body, but it will still cause an error if there is
  a real attempt to use these symbols as quantifiers.

  The use of ~ilc[defun-nx] above, rather than ~ilc[defun], disables certain
  checks that are required for evaluation, in particular the single-threaded
  use of ~ilc[stobj]s.  However, there is a price: calls of these defined
  functions cannot be evaluated; ~pl[defun-nx].  Normally that is not a
  problem, since these notions involve quantifiers.  But you are welcome to
  replace this ~ilc[declare] form with your own, as follows: if you supply a
  list of ~c[declare] forms to keyword argument ~c[:witness-dcls], these will
  become the declare forms in the generated ~ilc[defun].  Note that if your
  value of ~c[witness-dcls] does not contain the form
  ~c[(declare (xargs :non-executable t))], then the appropriate wrapper for
  non-executable functions will not be added automatically, i.e., ~ilc[defun]
  will be used in place of ~c[defun-nx].  Note also that if ~il[guard]
  verification is attempted, then it will likely fail with an error message
  complaining that ``guard verification may depend on local properties.''  In
  that case, you may wish to delay guard verification, as in the following
  example.
  ~bv[]
  (encapsulate
   ()
   (defun-sk foo (x)
     (exists n (and (integerp n)
                    (< n x)))
     :witness-dcls ((declare (xargs :guard (integerp x)
                                    :verify-guards nil))))
   (verify-guards foo))
  ~ev[]

  ~c[Defun-sk] is a macro implemented using ~ilc[defchoose].  Hence, it should
  only be executed in ~il[defun-mode] ~c[:]~ilc[logic]; ~pl[defun-mode] and
  ~pl[defchoose].  Advanced feature: If argument ~c[:strengthen t] is passed to
  ~c[defun-sk], then ~c[:strengthen t] will generate the extra constraint that
  that is generated for the corresponding ~c[defchoose] event; ~pl[defchoose].
  You can use the command ~c[:]~ilc[pcb!] to see the event generated by a call
  of the ~c[defun-sk] macro.

  If you find that the rewrite rules introduced with a particular use of
  ~c[defun-sk] are not ideal, even when using the ~c[:rewrite] keyword
  discussed above (in the ~c[forall] case), then at least two reasonable
  courses of action are available for you.  Perhaps the best option is to prove
  the ~ilc[rewrite] rules you want.  If you see a pattern for creating rewrite
  rules from your ~c[defun-sk] events, you might want to write a macro that
  executes a ~c[defun-sk] followed by one or more ~ilc[defthm] events.  Another
  option is to write your own variant of the ~c[defun-sk] macro, say,
  ~c[my-defun-sk], for example by modifying a copy of the definition of
  ~c[defun-sk] from the ACL2 sources.

  If you want to represent nested quantifiers, you can use more than one
  ~c[defun-sk] event.  For example, in order to represent
  ~bv[]
  (forall x (exists y (p x y z)))
  ~ev[]
  you can use ~c[defun-sk] twice, for example as follows.
  ~bv[]
  (defun-sk exists-y-p (x z)
    (exists y (p x y z)))

  (defun-sk forall-x-exists-y-p (z)
    (forall x (exists-y-p x z)))
  ~ev[]

  Some distracting and unimportant warnings are inhibited during
  ~c[defun-sk].

  Note for ACL2(r) users (~pl[real]): In ACL2(r), the keyword ~c[:CLASSICALP]
  is also supported.  Its legal values are ~c[t] (the default) and ~c[nil], and
  it determines whether or not (respectively) ACL2(r) will consider ~c[fn] to
  be a classical function.  It must be the case that the value is
  ~c[t] (perhaps implicitly, by default) if and only if ~c[body] is classical.

  Note that this way of implementing quantifiers is not a new idea.  Hilbert
  was certainly aware of it 60 years ago!  Also
  ~pl[conservativity-of-defchoose] for a technical argument that justifies the
  logical conservativity of the ~ilc[defchoose] event in the sense of the paper
  by Kaufmann and Moore entitled ``Structured Theory Development for a
  Mechanized Logic'' (Journal of Automated Reasoning 26, no. 2 (2001),
  pp. 161-203).~/"

  The following example illustrates how to do proofs about functions defined

  (~pl[books]).  The example is contrived and rather silly, in that it shows
  how to prove that a quantified notion implies itself, where the antecedent
  and conclusion are defined with different ~ilc[defun-sk] events.  But it
  illustrates the formulas that are generated by ~ilc[defun-sk], and how to use
  them.  Thanks to Julien Schmaltz for presenting this example as a challenge.

  A Beginner's Guide to Reasoning about Quantification in ACL2~/

  The initial version of this tutorial was written by Sandip Ray.  Additions
  and revisions are welcome.  Sandip has said:
  ~bq[]
  ``This is a collection of notes that I wrote to remind myself of how to
  reason about quantifiers when I just started.  Most users after they have
  gotten the hang of quantifiers probably will not need this and will be able
  to use their intuitions to guide them in the process.  But since many ACL2
  users are not used to quantification, I am hoping that this set of notes
  might help them to think clearly while reasoning about quantifiers in
  ACL2.''~eq[]

  Many ACL2 papers start with the sentence ``ACL2 is a quantifier-free
  first-order logic of recursive functions.''  It is true that the ~em[syntax]
  of ACL2 is quantifier-free; every formula is assumed to be universally
  quantified over all free variables in the formula.  But the ~em[logic] in
  fact does afford arbitrary first-order quantification.  This is obtained in
  ACL2 using a construct called ~c[defun-sk].  ~l[defun-sk].

  Many ACL2 users do not think in terms of ~il[quantifiers].  The focus is
  almost always on defining recursive functions and reasoning about them using
  induction.  That is entirely justified, in fact, since proving theorems about
  recursive functions by induction plays to the strengths of the theorem
  prover.  Nevertheless there are situations where it is reasonable and often
  useful to think in terms of quantifiers.  However, reasoning about
  quantifiers requires that you get into the mindset of thinking about theorems
  in terms of quantification.  This note is about how to do this effectively
  given ACL2's implementation of quantification.  This does not discuss
  ~ilc[defun-sk] in detail, but merely shows some examples.  A detailed
  explanation of the implementation is in the ACL2 ~il[documentation]
  (~pl[defun-sk]); also ~pl[conservativity-of-defchoose].

  [Note: Quantifiers can be used for some pretty cool things in ACL2.  Perhaps
  the most interesting example is the way of using quantifiers to introduce
  arbitrary tail-recursive equations; see the paper ``Partial Functions in
  ACL2'' by Panagiotis Manolios and J Strother Moore.  This note does not
  address applications of quantifiers, but merely how you would reason about
  them once you think you want to use them.]~/

  Assume that you have some function ~c[P].  I have just left ~c[P] as a unary
  function stub below, since I do not care about what ~c[P] is.
  ~bv[]
  (defstub P (*) => *)
  ~ev[]
  Now suppose you want to specify the concept that ``there exists some ~c[x]
  such that ~c[(P x)] holds''.  ACL2 allows you to write that directly using
  quantifiers.
  ~bv[]
  (defun-sk exists-P () (exists x (P x)))
  ~ev[]
  If you submit the above form in ACL2 you will see that the theorem prover
  specifies two functions ~c[exists-p] and ~c[exists-p-witness], and exports
  the following constraints:
  ~bv[]
  1.  (defun exists-P () (P (exists-P-witness)))
  2.  (defthm exists-P-suff (implies (p x) (exists-p)))
  ~ev[]
  Here ~c[exists-P-witness] is a new function symbol in the current ACL2
  theory.  What do the constraints above say?  Notice the constraint
  ~c[exists-p-suff].  It says that if you can provide any ~c[x] such that
  ~c[(P x)] holds, then you know that ~c[exists-p] holds.  Think of the other
  constraint (definition of ~c[exists-p]) as going the other way.  That is, it
  says that if ~c[exists-p] holds, then there is some ~c[x], call it
  ~c[(exists-p-witness)], for which ~c[P] holds.  Notice that nothing else is
  known about ~c[exists-p-witness] than the two constraints above.

  [Note: ~c[exists-p-witness] above is actually defined in ACL2 using a special
  form called ~c[defchoose].  ~l[defchoose].  This note does not talk about
  ~c[defchoose].  So far as this note is concerned, think of
  ~c[exists-p-witness] as a new function symbol that has been generated somehow
  in ACL2, about which nothing other than the two facts above is known.]

  Similarly, you can talk about the concept that ``for all ~c[x] ~c[(P x)]
  holds.'' This can be specified in ACL2 by the form:
  ~bv[]
  (defun-sk forall-P () (forall x (P x)))
  ~ev[]
  This produces the following two constraints:
  ~bv[]
  1.  (defun forall-P () (P (forall-p-witness)))
  2.  (defthm forall-p-necc (implies (not (P x)) (not (forall-p))))
  ~ev[]
  To understand these, think of ~c[for-all-p-witness] as producing some ~c[x]
  which does not satisfy ~c[P], if such a thing exists.  The constraint
  ~c[forall-p-necc] merely says that if ~c[forall-p] holds then ~c[P] is
  satisfied for every ~c[x].  (To see this more clearly, just think of the
  contrapositive of the formula shown.) The other constraint (definition of
  ~c[forall-p]) implies that if ~c[forall-p] does not hold then there is some
  ~c[x], call it ~c[(forall-p-witness)], which does not satisfy ~c[P].  To see
  this, just consider the following formula which is immediately derivable from
  the definition.
  ~bv[]
  (implies (not (forall-p)) (not (P (forall-witness))))
  ~ev[]
  The description above suggests that to reason about quantifiers, the
  following Rules of Thumb, familiar to most any student of logic, are useful.
  ~bq[]
  RT1: To prove ~c[(exists-p)], construct some object ~c[A] such that ~c[P]
  holds for ~c[A] and then use ~c[exists-P-suff].

  RT2: If you assume ~c[exists-P] in your hypothesis, use the definition of
  ~c[exists-p] to know that ~c[P] holds for ~c[exists-p-witness].  To use this
  to prove a theorem, you must be able to derive the theorem based on the
  hypothesis that ~c[P] holds for something, whatever the something is.

  RT3: To prove ~c[forall-P], prove the theorem ~c[(P x)] (that is, that ~c[P]
  holds for an arbitrary ~c[x]), and then simply instantiate the definition of
  ~c[forall-p], that is, show that ~c[P] holds for the witness.

  RT4: If you assume ~c[forall-p] in the hypothesis of the theorem, see how you
  can prove your conclusion if indeed you were given ~c[(P x)] as a theorem.
  Possibly for the conclusion to hold, you needed that ~c[P] holds for some
  specific set of ~c[x] values.  Then use the theorem ~c[forall-p-necc] by
  instantiating it for the specific ~c[x] values you care about.~eq[]

  Perhaps the above is too terse.  In the remainder of the note, we will
  consider several examples of how this is done to prove theorems in ACL2 that
  involve quantified notions.

  Let us consider two trivial theorems.  Assume that for some unary function
  ~c[r], you have proved ~c[(r x)] as a theorem.  Let us see how you can prove
  that (1) there exists some x such that ~c[(r x)] holds, and (2) for all ~c[x]
  ~c[(r x)] holds.

  We first model these things using ~ilc[defun-sk].  Below, ~c[r] is simply
  some function for which ~c[(r x)] is a theorem.
  ~bv[]
  (encapsulate 
   (((r *) => *))
   (local (defun r (x) (declare (ignore x)) t))
   (defthm r-holds (r x)))

  (defun-sk exists-r () (exists x (r x)))
  (defun-sk forall-r () (forall x (r x)))
  ~ev[]
  ACL2 does not have too much reasoning support for quantifiers.  So in most
  cases, one would need ~c[:use] hints to reason about quantifiers.  In order
  to apply ~c[:use] ~il[hints], it is preferable to keep the function
  definitions and theorems disabled.
  ~bv[]
  (in-theory (disable exists-r exists-r-suff forall-r forall-r-necc))
  ~ev[]
  Let us now prove that there is some ~c[x] such that ~c[(r x)] holds.  Since
  we want to prove ~c[exists-r], we must use ~c[exists-r-suff] by RT1.  We do
  not need to construct any instance here since ~c[r] holds for all ~c[x] by
  the theorem above.
  ~bv[]
  (defthm exists-r-holds
    (exists-r)
    :hints ((\"Goal\" :use ((:instance exists-r-suff)))))
  ~ev[]
  Let us now prove the theorem that for all ~c[x], ~c[(r x)] holds.  By RT3, we
  must be able to prove it by definition of ~c[forall-r].
  ~bv[]
  (defthm forall-r-holds
    (forall-r)
    :hints ((\"Goal\" :use ((:instance (:definition forall-r))))))
  ~ev[]
  [Note: Probably no ACL2 user in his or her right mind would prove the
  theorems ~c[exists-r-holds] and ~c[forall-r-holds] above.  The theorems shown
  are only for demonstration purposes.]

  For the remainder of this note we will assume that we have two stubbed out
  unary functions ~c[M] and ~c[N], and we will look at proving some quantified
  properties of these functions.
  ~bv[]
  (defstub M (*) => *)
  (defstub N (*) => *)
  ~ev[]
  Let us now define the predicates ~c[all-M], ~c[all-N], ~c[ex-M], and ~c[ex-N]
  specifying the various quantifications.
  ~bv[]
  (defun-sk all-M () (forall x (M x)))
  (defun-sk all-N () (forall x (N x)))
  (defun-sk some-M () (exists x (M x)))
  (defun-sk some-N () (exists x (N x)))

  (in-theory (disable all-M all-N all-M-necc all-N-necc))
  (in-theory (disable some-M some-N some-M-suff some-N-suff))
  ~ev[]
  Let us prove the classic distributive properties of quantification: the
  distributivity of universal quantification over conjunction, and the
  distributivity of existential quantification over disjunction.  We can state
  these properties informally in ``pseudo ACL2'' notation as follows:
  ~bv[]
  1.  (exists x: (M x)) or (exists x: (N x)) <=> (exists x: (M x) or (N x))
  2.  (forall x: (M x)) and (forall: x (N x)) <=> (forall x: (M x) and (N x))
  ~ev[]
  To make these notions formal we of course need to define the formulas at the
  right-hand sides of 1 and 2.  So we define ~c[some-MN] and ~c[all-MN] to
  capture these concepts.
  ~bv[]
  (defun-sk some-MN () (exists x (or (M x) (N x))))
  (defun-sk all-MN () (forall x (and (M x) (N x))))

  (in-theory (disable all-MN all-MN-necc some-MN some-MN-suff))
  ~ev[]
  First consider proving property 1.  The formal statement of this theorem would
  be: ~c[(iff (some-MN) (or (some-M) (some-N)))].

  How do we prove this theorem?  Looking at RT1-RT4 above, note that they
  suggest how one should reason about quantification when one has an
  ``implication''.  But here we have an ``equivalence''.  This suggests another
  rule of thumb.
  ~bq[]
  RT5: Whenever possible, prove an equivalence involving quantifiers by proving
  two implications.~eq[]

  Let us apply RT5 to prove the theorems above.  So we will first prove:
  ~c[(implies (some-MN) (or (some-M) (some-N)))]

  How can we prove this?  This involves assuming a quantified predicate
  ~c[(some-MN)], so we must use RT2 and apply the definition of ~c[some-MN].
  Since the conclusion involves a disjunction of two quantified predicates, by
  RT1 we must be able to construct two objects ~c[A] and ~c[B] such that either
  ~c[M] holds for ~c[A] or ~c[N] holds for ~c[B], so that we can then invoke
  ~c[some-M-suff] and ~c[some-N-suff] to prove the conclusion.  But now notice
  that if ~c[some-MN] is true, then there is already an object, in fact
  ~c[some-MN-witness], such that either ~c[M] holds for it, or ~c[N] holds for
  it.  And we know this is the case from the definition of ~c[some-MN]! So we
  will simply prove the theorem instantiating ~c[some-M-suff] and
  ~c[some-N-suff] with this witness.  The conclusion is that the following
  event will go through with ACL2.
  ~bv[]
  (defthm le1
    (implies (some-MN)
             (or (some-M) (some-N)))
    :rule-classes nil
    :hints ((\"Goal\"
              :use ((:instance (:definition some-MN))
                    (:instance some-M-suff
                               (x (some-MN-witness)))
                    (:instance some-N-suff
                               (x (some-MN-witness)))))))
  ~ev[]
  This also suggests the following rule of thumb:
  ~bq[]
  RT6: If a conjecture involves assuming an existentially quantified predicate
  in the hypothesis from which you are trying to prove an existentially
  quantified predicate, use the witness of the existential quantification in
  the hypothesis to construct the witness for the existential quantification in
  the conclusion.~eq[]

  Let us now try to prove the converse of le1, that is:
  ~c[(implies (or (some-M) (some-N)) (some-MN))]

  Since the hypothesis is a disjunction, we will just prove each case
  individually instead of proving the theorem by a :~c[cases] hint.  So we
  prove the following two lemmas.
  ~bv[]
  (defthm le2
    (implies (some-M) (some-MN))
    :rule-classes nil
    :hints ((\"Goal\"
              :use ((:instance (:definition some-M))
                    (:instance some-MN-suff
                               (x (some-M-witness)))))))

  (defthm le3
    (implies (some-N) (some-MN))
    :rule-classes nil
    :hints ((\"Goal\"
              :use ((:instance (:definition some-N))
                    (:instance some-MN-suff
                               (x (some-N-witness)))))))
  ~ev[]
  Note that the hints above are simply applications of RT6 as in ~c[le1].  With
  these lemmas, of course the main theorem is trivial.
  ~bv[]
  (defthmd |some disjunction|
    (iff (some-MN) (or (some-M) (some-N)))
    :hints ((\"Goal\"
              :use ((:instance le1)
                    (:instance le2)
                    (:instance le3)))))
  ~ev[]
  Let us now prove the distributivity of universal quantification over
  conjunction, that is, the formula: ~c[(iff (all-MN) (and (all-M) (all-N)))]

  Applying RT5, we will again decompose this into two implications.  So
  consider first the one-way implication:
  ~c[(implies (and (all-M) (all-N)) (all-MN))].

  Here we get to assume ~c[all-M] and ~c[all-N].  Thus by RT4 we can use
  ~c[all-M-necc] and ~c[all-N-necc] to think as if we are given the formulas
  ~c[(M x)] and ~c[(N x)] as theorems.  The conclusion here is also a universal
  quantification, namely we have to prove ~c[all-MN].  Then RT3 tells us to
  proceed as follows.  Take any object ~c[y].  Try to find an instantiation
  ~c[z] of the hypothesis that implies ~c[(and (M y) (N y))].  Then instantiate
  ~c[y] with ~c[all-MN-witness].  Note that the hypothesis lets us assume
  ~c[(M x)] and ~c[(N x)] to be theorems.  Thus to justify we need to
  instantiate ~c[x] with ~c[y], and in this case, therefore, with
  ~c[all-MN-witness].  To make the long story short, the following event goes
  through with ACL2:
  ~bv[]
  (defthm lf1
     (implies (and (all-M) (all-N))
              (all-MN))
      :rule-classes nil
      :hints ((\"Goal\"
                :use ((:instance (:definition all-MN))
                      (:instance all-M-necc (x (all-MN-witness)))
                      (:instance all-N-necc (x (all-MN-witness)))))))
  ~ev[]
  This suggests the following rule of thumb which is a dual of RT6:
  ~bq[]
  RT7: If a conjecture assumes some universally quantified predicate in the
  hypothesis and its conclusion asserts a universallly quantified predicate,
  then instantiate the ``necessary condition'' (~c[forall-mn-necc]) of the
  hypothesis with the witness of the conclusion to prove the conjecture.~eq[]

  Applying RT7 now we can easily prove the other theorems that we need to show
  that universal quantification distributes over conjunction.  Let us just go
  through this motion in ACL2.
  ~bv[]
  (defthm lf2
    (implies (all-MN)
             (all-M))
    :rule-classes nil
    :hints ((\"Goal\"
              :use ((:instance (:definition all-M))
                    (:instance all-MN-necc 
                               (x (all-M-witness)))))))

  (defthm lf3
    (implies (all-MN)
             (all-N))
    :rule-classes nil      
    :hints ((\"Goal\"
              :use ((:instance (:definition all-N))
                    (:instance all-MN-necc 
                               (x (all-N-witness)))))))

  (defthmd |all conjunction|
    (iff (all-MN)
         (and (all-M) (all-N)))
   :hints ((\"Goal\" :use ((:instance lf1)
                         (:instance lf2)
                         (:instance lf3)))))
  ~ev[]
  The rules of thumb for universal and existential quantification should make
  you realize the duality of their use.  Every reasoning method about universal
  quantification can be cast as a way of reasoning about existential
  quantification, and vice versa.  Whether you reason using universal and
  existential quantifiers depends on what is natural in a particular context.
  But just for the sake of completeness let us prove the duality of universal
  and existential quantifiers.  So what we want to prove is the following:
  ~bv[]
  3.  (forall x (not (M x))) = (not (exists x (M x)))
  ~ev[]
  We first formalize the notion of ~c[(forall x (not (M x)))] as a
  quantification.
  ~bv[]
  (defun-sk none-M () (forall x (not (M x))))
  (in-theory (disable none-M none-M-necc))
  ~ev[]
  So we now want to prove: ~c[(equal (none-M) (not (some-M)))].

  As before, we should prove this as a pair of implications.  So let us prove
  first: ~c[(implies (none-M) (not (some-M)))].

  This may seem to assert an existential quantification in the conclusion, but
  rather, it asserts the ~em[negation] of an existential quantification.  We
  are now trying to prove that something does not exist.  How do we do that?
  We can show that nothing satisfies ~c[M] by just showing that
  ~c[(some-M-witness)] does not satisfy ~c[M].  This suggests the following
  rule of thumb:
  ~bq[]
  RT8: When you encounter the negation of an existential quantification think
  in terms of a universal quantification, and vice-versa.
  ~eq[]
  Ok, so now applying RT8 and RT3 you should be trying to apply the definition of
  ~c[some-M].  The hypothesis is just a pure (non-negated) universal quantification
  so you should apply RT4.  A blind application lets us prove the theorem as
  below.
  ~bv[]
  (defthm nl1
    (implies (none-M) (not (some-M)))
    :rule-classes nil
    :hints ((\"Goal\"
              :use ((:instance (:definition some-M))
                    (:instance none-M-necc (x (some-M-witness)))))))
  ~ev[]
  How about the converse implication?  I have deliberately written it as
  ~c[(implies (not (none-M)) (some-M))] instead of switching the left-hand and
  right-hand sides of ~c[nl1], which would have been equivalent.  Again, RH8
  tells us how to reason about it, in this case using RH2, and we succeed.
  ~bv[]
  (defthm nl2
    (implies (not (none-M)) (some-M))
    :rule-classes nil
    :hints ((\"Goal\"
              :use ((:instance (:definition none-M))
                    (:instance some-M-suff (x (none-M-witness)))))))
  ~ev[]
  So finally we just go through the motions of proving the equality.
  ~bv[]
  (defthmd |forall not = not exists|
    (equal (none-M) (not (some-M)))
    :hints ((\"Goal\"
              :use ((:instance nl1)
                    (:instance nl2)))))
  ~ev[]
  Let us now see if we can prove a slightly more advanced theorem which can be
  stated informally as: If there is a natural number ~c[x] which satisfies
  ~c[M], then there is a least natural number ~c[y] that satisfies ~c[M].

  [Note: Any time I have had to reason about existential quantification I have
  had to do this particular style of reasoning and state that if there is an
  object satisfying a predicate, then there is also a ``minimal'' object
  satisfying the predicate.]

  Let us formalize this concept.  We first define the concept of existence of a
  natural number satisfying ~c[x].
  ~bv[]
  (defun-sk some-nat-M () (exists x (and (natp x) (M x))))
  (in-theory (disable some-nat-M some-nat-M-suff))
  ~ev[]
  We now talk about what it means to say that ~c[x] is the least number
  satisfying ~c[M].
  ~bv[]
  (defun-sk none-below (y) 
    (forall r (implies (and (natp r) (< r y)) (not (M r))))))
  (in-theory (disable none-below none-below-necc))

  (defun-sk min-M () (exists y (and (M y) (natp y) (none-below y))))
  (in-theory (disable min-M min-M-suff))
  ~ev[]
  The predicate ~c[none-below] says that no natural number less than ~c[y]
  satisfies ~c[M].  The predicate ~c[min-M] says that there is some natural
  number ~c[y] satisfying ~c[M] such that ~c[none-below] holds for ~c[y].

  So the formula we want to prove is: ~c[(implies (some-nat-M) (min-M))].

  Since the formula requires that we prove an existential quantification, RT1
  tells us to construct some object satisfying the predicate over which we are
  quantifying.  We should then be able to instantiate ~c[min-M-suff] with this
  object.  That predicate says that the object must be the least natural number
  that satisfies ~c[M].  Since such an object is uniquely computable if we know
  that there exists some natural number satisfying ~c[M], let us just write a
  recursive function to compute it.  This function is ~c[least-M] below.
  ~bv[]
  (defun least-M-aux (i bound)
    (declare (xargs :measure (nfix (- (1+ bound) i))))
    (cond ((or (not (natp i))
               (not (natp bound))
               (> i bound))
           0)
         ((M i) i)
         (t (least-M-aux (+ i 1) bound))))

  (defun least-M (bound) (least-M-aux 0 bound))
  ~ev[]
  Let us now reason about this function as one does typically.  So we prove
  that this object is indeed the least natural number that satisfies ~c[M],
  assuming that ~c[bound] is a natural number that satisfies ~c[M].
  ~bv[]

  So we have done that, and hopefully this is all that we need about
  ~c[least-M].  So we disable everything.
  ~bv[]
  (in-theory (disable least-M natp))
  ~ev[]
  Now of course we note that the statement of the conjecture we are interested
  in has two quantifiers, an inner ~c[forall] (from ~c[none-below]) and an
  outer ~c[exists] (from ~c[min-M]).  Since ACL2 is not very good with
  quantification, we hold its hands to reason with the quantifier part.  So we
  will first prove something about the ~c[forall] and then use it to prove what
  we need about the ~c[exists].
  ~bq[]
  RT9: When you face nested quantifiers, reason about each nesting
  separately.~eq[]

  So what do we want to prove about the inner quantifier?  Looking carefully at
  the definition of ~c[none-below] we see that it is saying that for all natural
  numbers ~c[r] < ~c[y], ~c[(M r)] does not hold.  Well, how would we want to
  use this fact when we want to prove our final theorem?  We expect that we
  will instantiate ~c[min-M-suff] with the object ~c[(least-M bound)] where we
  know (via the outermost existential quantifier) that ~c[M] holds for
  ~c[bound], and we will then want to show that ~c[none-below] holds for
  ~c[(least-M bound)].  So let us prove that for any natural number (call it
  ~c[bound]), ~c[none-below] holds for ~c[(least-M bound)].  For the final
  theorem we only need it for natural numbers satisfying ~c[M], but note that
  from the lemma ~c[least-is-minimal-satisfying-m] we really do not need that
  ~c[bound] satisfies ~c[M].

  So we are now proving:
  ~c[(implies (natp bound) (none-below (least-M bound)))].

  Well since this is a standard case of proving a universally quantified
  predicate, we just apply RT3.  We have proved that for all naturals ~c[i] <
  ~c[(least-M bound)], ~c[i] does not satisfy ~c[M] (lemma
  ~c[least-is-minimal-satisfying-M]), so we merely need the instantiation of
  that lemma with ~c[none-below-witness] of the thing we are trying to prove,
  that is, ~c[(least-M bound)].  The theorem below thus goes through.
  ~bv[]
  (defthm least-is-minimal
    (implies (natp bound)
             (none-below (least-M bound)))
    :hints ((\"Goal\"
              :use ((:instance (:definition none-below)

                    (:instance least-is-minimal-satisfying-m
                               (i (none-below-witness (least-M bound))))))))
  ~ev[]
  Finally we are in the outermost existential quantifier, and are in the
  process of applying ~c[min-M-suff].  What object should we instantiate it
  with?  We must instantiate it with ~c[(least-M bound)] where ~c[bound] is an
  object which must satisfy ~c[M] and is a natural.  We have such an object,
  namely ~c[(some-nat-M-witness)] which we know have all these qualities given
  the hypothesis.  So the proof now is just RT1 and RT2.

  If you are comfortable with the reasoning above, then you are comfortable
  with quantifiers and probably will not need these notes any more.  In my
  opinion, the best way of dealing with ACL2 is to ask yourself why you think
  something is a theorem, and the rules of thumb above are simply guides to the
  questions that you need to ask when you are dealing with quantification.

  Here are a couple of simple exercises for you to test if you understand
  the reasoning process.

  ~st[Exercise 1].  Formalize and prove the following theorem.  Suppose there
  exists ~c[x] such that ~c[(R x)] and suppose that all ~c[x] satisfy
  ~c[(P x)].  Then prove that there exists ~c[x] such that ~c[(P x) & (R x)].
  (See
  ~url[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/contrib/quantifier-exercise-1-solution.html]
  for a solution.)

  ~st[Exercise 2].  Recall the example just before the preceding exercise,
  where we showed that if there exists a natural number ~c[x] satisfying ~c[M]
  then there is another natural number ~c[y] such that ~c[y] satisfies ~c[M]
  and for every natural number ~c[z] < ~c[y], ~c[z] does not.  What would
  happen if we remove the restriction of ~c[x], ~c[y], and ~c[z] being
  naturals?  Of course, we will not talk about ~c[<] any more, but suppose you
  use the total order on all ACL2 objects (from community book
  ~c[\"books/misc/total-order\"]).  More concretely, consider the definition of
  ~c[some-M] above.  Let us now define two other functions:
  ~bv[]
  (include-book \"misc/total-order\" :dir :system)

  (defun-sk none-below-2 (y)
    (forall r (implies (<< r y) (not (M r)))))

  (defun-sk min-M2 () (exists y (and (M y) (none-below-2 y))))
  ~ev[]
  The question is whether ~c[(implies (some-M) (min-M2))] is a theorem.  Can
  you prove it?  Can you disprove it?~/")

  issues about quantification in ACL2~/

  ACL2 supports first-order quantifiers ~ilc[exists] and ~ilc[forall] by way of
  the ~ilc[defun-sk] event.  However, proof support for quantification is quite
  limited.  Therefore, you may prefer using recursion in place of ~c[defun-sk]
  when possible (following common ACL2 practice).~/

  For example, the notion ``every member of ~c[x] has property ~c[p]'' can be
  defined either with recursion or explicit quantification, but proofs may be
  simpler when recursion is used.  We illustrate this point with two proofs of
  the same informal claim, one of which uses recursion which the other uses
  explicit quantification.  Notice that with recursion, the proof goes through
  fully automatically; but this is far from true with explicit quantification
  (especially notable is the ugly hint).

  The informal claim for our examples is:  If every member ~c[a] of each
  of two lists satisfies the predicate ~c[(p a)], then this holds of their
  ~ilc[append]; and, conversely.

  ~l[quantifiers-using-recursion] for a solution to this example using
  recursion.

  ~l[quantifiers-using-defun-sk] for a solution to this example using
  ~ilc[defun-sk].  Also ~l[quantifiers-using-defun-sk-extended] for an
  elaboration on that solution.

  But perhaps first, ~pl[defun-sk] for an ACL2 utility to introduce first-order
  quantification in a direct way.  Examples of the use of ~c[defun-sk] are also
  available: ~pl[defun-sk-example] and ~pl[Tutorial4-Defun-Sk-Example] for
  basic examples, and ~pl[quantifier-tutorial] for a more complete, careful
  beginner's introduction that takes you through typical kinds of
  quantifier-based reasoning in ACL2.~/")

; The functions introduced by defstobj are all defined with
; :VERIFY-GUARDS T.  This means we must ensure that their guards and
; bodies are compliant.  Most of this stuff is mechanically generated
; by us and is guaranteed to be compliant.  But there is a way that a
; user defined function can sneak in.  The user might use a type-spec
; such as (satisfies foo), where foo is a user defined function.

; To discuss the guard issue, we name the functions introduced by
; defstobj, following the convention used in the comment in
; defstobj-template.  The recognizer for the stobj itself will be
; called namep, and the creator will be called create-name.  For each
; field, the following names are introduced: recog-name - recognizer
; for the field value; accessor-name - accessor for the field;
; updater-name - updater for the field; length-name - length of array
; field; resize-name - resizing function for array field.

; We are interested in determining the conditions we must check to
; ensure that each of these functions is Common Lisp compliant.  Both
; the guard and the body of each function must be compliant.
; Inspection of defstobj-axiomatic-defs reveals the following.

; Namep is defined in terms of primitives and the recog-names.  The
; guard for namep is T.  The body of namep is always compliant, if the
; recog-names are compliant and have guards of T.

; Create-name is a constant with a guard of T.  Its body is always
; compliant.

; Recog-name has a guard of T.  The body of recog-name is interesting
; from the guard verification perspective, because it may contain
; translated type-spec such as (satisfies foo) and so we must check
; that foo is compliant.  We must also check that the guard of foo is
; T, because the guard of recog-name is T and we might call foo on
; anything.

; Accessor-name is not interesting:  its guard is namep and its body is
; primitive.  We will have checked that namep is compliant.

; Updater-name is not interesting:  its guard may involve translated
; type-specs and will involve namep, but we will have checked their
; compliance already.

; Length-name and resize-name have guards that are calls of namep, and
; their bodies are known to satisfy their guards.

; So it all boils down to checking the compliance of the body of
; recog-name, for each component.  Note that we must check both that
; the type-spec only involves compliant functions and that every
; non-system function used has a guard of T.

; Essay on Defstobj Definitions

; Consider the following defstobj:

;   (defstobj $st
;     (flag :type t :initially run)
;     (pc   :type (integer 0 255) :initially 128)
;     (mem  :type (array (integer 0 255) (256)) :initially 0)
;     :renaming ((pc pcn)))

; If you call (defstobj-template '$st '((flag ...) ...)) you will get
; back a ``template'' which is sort of a normalized version of the
; event with the renaming applied and all the optional slots filled
; appropriately.  (See the definition of defstobj-template for details.)
; Let template be that template.

; To see the logical definitions generated by this defstobj event, invoke
;   (defstobj-axiomatic-defs '$st template (w state))

; To see the raw lisp definitions generated, invoke
;   (defstobj-raw-defs '$st template nil (w state))

; The *1* functions for the functions are all generated by oneifying
; the axiomatic defs.

; To see the deconsts generated, invoke
;   (defstobj-defconsts (strip-accessor-names (caddr template)) 0)

; It is important the guard conjectures for these functions be
; provable!  They are assumed by the admission process!  To prove
; the guards for the defstobj above, it helped to insert the following
; lemma after the defun of memp but before the definition of memi.

;   (defthm memp-implies-true-listp
;     (implies (memp x)
;              (true-listp x)))

; Even without this lemma, the proof succeeded, though it took much
; longer and involved quite a few generalizations and inductions.

; If you change any of the functions, I recommend generating the axiomatic
; defs for a particular defstobj such as that above and proving the guards.

; Up through v2-7 we also believed that we ensured that the guards in the
; axiomatic defs are sufficient for the raw defs.  However, starting with v2-8,
; this became moot because of the following claim: the raw Lisp functions are
; only called on live stobjs (this change, and others involving :inline, were
; contributed by Rob Sumners).  We believe this claim because of the following
; argument.  Note that there is an exception for the recognizer, which can be
; applied to an ordinary object, but we do not consider this exception here.
;
;   a) The *1* function now has an additional requirement that not only does
;      guard checking pass, but also, all of the stobjs arguments passed in
;      must be the live stobjs in order to execute raw Common Lisp.
;   b) Due to the syntactic restrictions that ACL2 enforces, we know that the
;      direct correspondence between live stobjs and stobj arguments in the
;      raw Common Lisp functions will persist throughout evaluation.
;      -- This can be proven by induction over the sequence of function calls
;         in any evaluation.
;      -- The base case is covered by the binding of stobj parameters to
;         the global live stobj in the acl2-loop, or by the restrictions
;         placed upon with-local-stobj and stobj-let.
;      -- The induction step is proven by the signature requirements of
;         functions that access and/or update stobjs.

; A reasonable question is: Should the guard for resize-name be
; strengthened so as to disallow sizes of at least (1- (expt 2 28))?
; Probably there is no need for this.  Logically, there is no such
; restriction; it is OK for the implementation to insist on such a
; bound when actually executing.

; Now we introduce the idea of the "template" of a defstobj, which
; includes a normalized version of the field descriptors under the
; renaming.

; not define the raw Lisp versions of the functions themselves
; (normally that would be derived from the axiomatic defs just
; processed).  Instead, we will store a CLTL-COMMAND below that
; handles the raw Lisp defs only.

; What follows is hard to follow and rather arcane.  Why do we include
; name in the ee-entry computed above, (defstobj name names)?  That
; entry will be added to the embedded-event-lst by
; process-embedded-events and be inspected by the individual defuns
; done.  Those defuns will recognize their fn name, fn, among names,
; to detect that they are being done as part of a defstobj.  The defun
; will pick up the stobj name, name, from the ee-entry and build it
; into the ignorep entry of the defun CLTL-COMMAND, to be processed by
; add-trip.  In add-trip, the stobj name, name, will find its way into
; the oneify-cltl-code that generates the *1* body for fn.  That body
; contains a throw upon detection of a guard error.  The object thrown
; contains the stobjs-in of the offensive expression, so we will know
; how to print it.  But the stobjs-in of fn is incorrectly set in the
; world right now -- more accurately, will be incorrectly set in the
; world in which the defun is done and the throw form is constructed
; -- because we have not yet declared name to be a stobj.  Indeed, we
; cannot declare it to be a stobj yet since we are defining functions
; that treat it as an ordinary list.  This is the stobj version of the
; super-defun-wart problem.

; on the live object representing the stobj.  This live object is
; created when the CLTL-COMMAND below is processed by add-trip.
; Add-trip evals the init form in raw lisp to create the live object
; and assign it to global variables.  It also creates array-based
; accessors and updaters.  It then stores this live object in the
; user-stobj-alist of the state just as suggested above, provided this
; is not a redefinition.  (For a redefinition of the stobj, it does a
; put-assoc-eq rather than a cons.)

; The down-side to this cheat is that this only works while
; defstobj-fn is a :program mode function called on the live state,
; where the raw code operates.  If I admitted this function to the
; logic and then called it on the live state, I would get an effect on
; the live state not explained by the code.  Furthermore, if I called
; it on a fake state, I would get a new fake state in which the new
; stobj was not on the user-stobj-alist.

; It will be a while before these discrepancies bother me enough to

; stobjs.

; Below, we use the term ``stobj primitive (for s)'' to indicate a function
; introduced by a defstobj or (more often) defabsstobj event (for stobj s).  In
; the case of defabsstobj, an ``:EXEC function'' or ``:LOGIC function'' is a
; stobj primitive associated with an :EXEC or :LOGIC keyword (perhaps by
; default), respectively.

; Informally, we wish to relate two kinds of evaluation, one using :LOGIC
; primitives and one using corresponding :EXEC primitives, in corresponding
; environments where each abstract stobj is bound to an object satisfying its
; :LOGIC recognizer in the first environment and its :EXEC recognizer in the
; second.  Such evaluation will enforce guards before making calls of stobj
; primitives at the :LOGIC level and (as we will see, by the :GUARD-THM
; theorems) guarantee that guards thus hold for calls of stobj primitives at
; the :EXEC level.  Because of the latter, we can even imagine passing live
; stobjs around for the :EXEC evaluation.  But the replacement of ACL2 objects
; by live stobjs is not what's new for abstract stobjs, so we do not address it
; here.  Thus in the remainder of this Essay, we deal only with ACL2 objects,
; without any consideration of raw Lisp evaluation using live stobjs.  We
; imagine two sorts of logical evaluation using either :LOGIC or :EXEC
; primitives, with the goal of showing that they keep the corresponding states
; (latches) in sync.

; Fix an ACL2 world, and let A be a set of abstract stobj names.  We introduce
; a variant of EV, A-evaluation, which models evaluation using :EXEC functions
; for abstract stobjs in A.  (But note that throughout, we ignore the EV
; arguments of state, hard-error-returns-nilp, and aok, which aren't of
; interest for our exposition.  See also the Essay on EV for some relevant
; background.)  As is the case for EV, A-evaluation maps a term, alist, and
; latches to a (possibly multiple) value and new latches, but for A-evaluation
; there is a new wrinkle: for each function symbol f introduced for an abstract
; stobj in A that is bound in latches, the :EXEC definition of f is used
; (instead of the logical definition, which invokes the :LOGIC function).  If A
; is the empty set, then A-evaluation reduces to EV, and we call it
; pure-evaluation.  As with EV, A-evaluation comprehends guards and can return
; an error indication when there is a guard violation; and in that case, as
; with actual ACL2 evaluation, it must return such an error when latched stobjs
; are involved (even with guard-checking nil or :NONE).

; It is tempting to show a direct correspondence between pure-evaluation and
; A-evaluation, where A is the set of abstract stobj names.  But we will
; instead define a sort of "dual-rail" evaluator that does both of these
; together, because we need those two evaluations to stop at the same time in
; order to compare their returned latches.  Now, it is possible to show that
; A-evaluation continues for at _least_ as long as pure-evaluation, by applying
; the :GUARD-THM theorems when comparing a :LOGIC function call during
; pure-evaluation with a corresponding :EXEC function call during A-evaluation.
; But A-evaluation could run longer, so we need a way to stop it at the point
; that pure-evaluation stops, in order to compare the returned latches for
; each.  Before we define our dual-rail evaluator, we need a few definitions.

; For a set A of abstract stobj names, an alist S is A-valid if for every stobj
; name s0 in the domain of S: if s0 is in A then S(s0) satisfies the :EXEC
; recognizer for s0, and otherwise S(s0) satisfies the recognizer for s0
; (hence, the :LOGIC recognizer for s0 if s0 is an abstract stobj).  We may say
; ``valid'' in place of ``A-valid'' if A is clear from context or
; ``pure-valid'' if A is the empty set.

; For a given abstract stobj s0, two ACL2 objects x$c and x$a are said to
; s0-correspond (or, just "correspond" if s0 is clear from context) if
; corr(x$c,x$a) holds, where corr is the (ordinary logical interpretation of
; the) :CORR-FN for s0.  Let A be a set of abstract stobj names and let S$c and
; S$a be alists.  We say that S$c and S$a A-correspond if they have the same
; domain and for every x in their domain: if x is in A then S$c(x) and S$a(x)
; correspond, and otherwise S$c(x) = S$a(x).  In the context of an expected
; stobjs-out, two results A-correspond if they have the same number of values
; and for each position n, if the nth element of the stobjs-out is some s0 in A
; then the respective nth values s0-correspond, and otherwise the respective
; nth values are equal.

; We are ready to model dual-rail evaluation with a function ev5.

;   (ev5 term alist$a alist$c latches$a latches$c A)
;   =
;   (mv erp result$c result$a latches$c' latches$a')

; The definition of EV5 (details omitted here) is, with two exceptions
; discussed below, a straightforward modification of EV for a dual-rail
; semantics, i.e., returning the results of A-evaluation (result$c and
; latches$c') and pure-evaluation (result$a and latches$a').  The first
; exception is that guards are checked only for pure-evaluation.  The second
; exception pertains to any call of a primitive for an abstract stobj in A that
; is bound in latches$c (or equivalently, in latches$a).  In that case,
; A-evaluation and pure-evaluation are used independently on the :EXEC and
; :LOGIC functions for the primitive, respectively, to compute the result pairs
; <result$c,latches$c'> and <result$a,latches$a'>, respectively).  We argue
; below that both of these evaluations occur without guard violations.

; The following correctness claim justifies the use of concrete stobjs to
; simulate evaluation with abstract stobjs.

;   Claim.  Let A be a set of abstract stobj names, and let u be a term.  Also
;   let S$c and S$a be A-corresponding alists that are A-valid and pure-valid,
;   respectively, with a common domain that includes all free variables of u.
;   Let L$c and L$a be the respective restrictions of S$c and S$a to a common
;   set of stobj names, and assume that A is a subset of the common domain of
;   L$c and L$a.  Assume either of the following, where EV_A is the variant of
;   EV that evaluates using :EXEC functions in the case of stobj primitives for
;   members of A.

;   (a) (ev_A u S$c L$c) = (mv erp r$c L$c')
;       AND
;       (ev   u S$a L$a) = (mv nil r$a L$a')
;   OR
;   (b) (ev5 u S$c S$a L$c L$a A) = (mv erp r$c r$a L$c' L$a').

;   Then the following properties hold.

;   (1) In case (b) with erp nil, and in case (a) (for any erp):
;       (i)  r$c A-corresponds to r$a; and
;       (ii) L$c' and L$a' are the respective updates of L$c and L$a
;            according to r$c, r$a, and the stobjs-out of u, in the obvious
;            sense.
;   (2) L$c', L$a', L$c, and (thus) L$a all have the same domain.
;   (3) L$c' A-corresponds to L$a'.
;   (4) L$c' is A-valid and L$a' is pure-valid.
;   (5) In case (a), erp is nil.

; Remark.  The subset restriction does not impair the relevance of this Claim.
; In an actual evaluation in the top-level loop, consider the latches as
; including a binding for every known stobj name that occurs in the term to be
; evaluated.  Local stobjs and stobj-let-bound stobjs don't present a problem,
; since each will add a binding to the latches; but we ignore these for the
; proof.

; Proof.  We give only an outline of the proof, first dealing with (a) by
; itself, then using (a) in the proof sketch for (b).

; The proof of (a) is by induction on A.  First consider the base case, where A
; is empty.  Clearly (1)(i), (3), and (5) hold vacuously.  Parts (1)(ii) and
; (2) are just facts about EV.  Finally, (4) reduces to showing that L$a' is
; pure-valid.  This follows from the :PRESERVED theorems, each of which has a
; stobj primitive guard as a hypothesis, and the fact that EV returns an error
; (mv non-nil ...) when the guard doesn't hold for a call of a stobj primitive.
; We omit details.

; So assume that A is non-empty.  Let s0 be the abstract stobj in A that was
; last introduced in the world.  Hence we may write A = A' U {s0} where by the
; inductive hypothesis, the claim holds for A'.

; We now proceed by computational induction.  We consider only the interesting
; case, leaving the rest to the reader: u is (f ... s0 ...), where f is a stobj
; primitive for s0 (whose arguments may include members of A'), and where the
; arguments evaluate without error.  Thus, we may assume (a), since (b) clearly
; implies (a) in the non-error case.  Let f$a and f$c be the :LOGIC and :EXEC
; functions for f (respectively).  For notational simplicity we consider only
; the case that f returns a single value; the general case is really the same,
; except for focusing on a particular position's result.  Let r' be the result
; of pure-evaluation of (f$c ... s0 ...).  We make the following two
; observations, each followed by a justification.

; (*)   r' {s0}-corresponds to r$a.

; To see this, first note that since we are assuming that the evaluation (ev u
; S$a L$a) does not result in an error, i.e., returns (mv nil ...), we know
; that the guard of f is met for the call of f in the term u.  We may therefore
; apply the :CORRESPONDENCE theorem for f, to show that (f$c ... s0 ...) and
; (f$a ... s0 ...) {s0}-correspond.  But these are respectively equal to r' and
; r$a because pure-evaluation (i.e., EV) returns a result provably equal to its
; input.

; (**)  r$c A'-corresponds to r'.

; This holds by the inductive hypothesis on A', since A'-evaluation of the body
; of f$c produces the same result as A-evaluation of the body of f$c (namely,
; r$c), as no primitive function for s0 is ancestral in f$c (because f$c was
; defined before the introduction of abstract stobj s0).

; From (*) and (**), a case analysis (on the type of result returned by f)
; yields that r$c A-corresponds to r$a.  Conclusion (1)(i) follows, and
; (1)(ii), (2), and (3) then follow by usual arguments for EV.  For (5), we
; observe that since the guard holds for the call of f (as argued for (*)
; above)), then by the :GUARD-THM theorems, the guard holds for the
; corresponding call of f$c; hence since f$c is guard-verified, its call's
; A-evaluation concludes without error.  For (4): the preservation of stobj
; recognizers for other than abstract stobjs, and thus for :EXEC recognizers
; for abstract stobjs in A, is a well-known property of well-guarded stobj
; computations (and the f$c is indeed well-guarded, as argued for (5) above);
; and for :LOGIC recognizers of stobjs in A it follows from the :PRESERVED
; theorems.  Note that the :PRESERVED theorems again require that the guard is
; met, which was argued above.

; That concludes the proof of case (a), so we now consider case (b).  The proof
; is by computational induction.  The interesting case is the same one we dealt
; with in the proof of case (a).  In case (b), EV5 first checks the guard for
; pure evaluation before passing control to EV_A and EV, passing up (mv erp
; ...) with erp non-nil if the check fails; and in that case we simply appeal
; to the inductive hypothesis.  But if the guard-check succeeds, then since f
; is guard-verified, we know that there will be no guard violation, and
; pure-evaluation (EV) will return with erp = nil.  So we can apply case (a),
; completing the proof.

; Note: the argument above probably works if we allow an arbitrary guard for a
; function exported by defabsstobj instead of using the guard of its :logic
; function.  If the need for such flexibility arises (presumably in the form of
; a new :guard keyword for defabsstobj :exports), we should revisit this Essay
; in order to be sure that the argument holds together.  But careful: allowing
; an arbitrary guard might not be feasible!  A comment in update-guard-post
; explains that substituting exported functions for their :logic versions has
; the property that guard proof obligations are essentially preserved.  But the
; use of user-supplied guards destroys that argument, and as a result, we no
; longer can trust evaluation of the guard in raw Lisp.

  ":Doc-Section Events

  define a new abstract single-threaded object ~/

  We assume familiarity with single-threaded objects; ~pl[stobj] and
  ~pl[defstobj].  The event ~c[defabsstobj] defines a so-called ``abstract
  stobj'', a notion we introduce briefly now and then explain in more depth
  below.

  The evaluation of a ~il[defstobj] event produces logical definitions for
  several functions: a recognizer, which characterizes the ~il[stobj] in terms
  of lists; a creator, which produces an initial suitable list structure; and
  field accessors and updators, defined in terms of ~ilc[nth] and
  ~ilc[update-nth].  ~c[Defabsstobj] provides a way to define alternate
  definitions for ``stobj primitives'' for a corresponding single-threaded
  object.  These stobj primitives include a recognizer, a creator, and other
  ``exported'' functions.  In essence, ~c[defabsstobj] establishes interface
  functions, or ``exports'', on a new stobj that is a copy of an indicated
  ``concrete'' stobj that already exists.

  We begin below with an introduction to abstract ~il[stobj]s.  We then explain
  the ~ilc[defabsstobj] event by way of an example.  We conclude by giving
  summary documentation for the ~c[defabsstobj] event.~/

  ~st[INTRODUCTION]

  We start with a brief review of ~il[stobj]s and some potential problems with
  them, followed by an introduction to abstract stobjs and how they can avoid
  these problems.  Prior experience with stobjs will probably help the reader
  to absorb the ideas below.

  Recall that single-threaded objects, or ~il[stobj]s, provide a way for ACL2
  users to stay within the ACL2 logic, where every data object is an atom or a
  ~ilc[cons] of data objects, while obtaining the benefits of fast evaluation
  through destructive updates.  Consider for example this very simple event.
  ~bv[]
  (defstobj st fld)
  ~ev[]
  This event introduces a recognizer, ~c[stp], and a creator, ~c[create-st],
  for a data structure consisting of a single field accessed and updated by
  functions ~c[fld] and ~c[update-fld], respectively.  Each of these four
  primitive functions has both a logical definition, which is used when the
  prover reasons about the function, and an executable definition, which is
  used in raw Lisp.  In the logic, ~c[stp] recognizes objects that have the
  requisite fields.  In raw Lisp, there is a ``live stobj'', which is an array
  object whose fields correspond to those specified by the ~ilc[defstobj]
  event, implemented as Lisp arrays.

  Here are the logical definition and the executable definition, respectively,
  that are introduced for the field accessor, ~c[fld], introduced above.
  Notice that since a stobj is represented in raw Lisp using an array, the raw
  Lisp accessor uses a raw Lisp array accessor, ~c[svref].  (You can see all
  the logical and executable definitions by evaluating the form
  ~c[(trace$ defstobj-axiomatic-defs defstobj-raw-defs)] before evaluating the
  ~ilc[defstobj] form.)
  ~bv[]
  ; logical definition

  Sophisticated programming with stobjs can provide efficient implementations
  of algorithms, but may require the preservation of a complex invariant.  One
  can, of course, define a function to implement such an invariant after
  introducing the stobj, as follows.
  ~bv[]
  ; Introduce a stobj.
  (defstobj st fld1 ... fldk)

  ; Define an invariant on that stobj.
  (defun good-stp (st)
    (declare (xargs :stobjs st))
    ...)

  ; Define some basic functions that update the stobj and preserve the
  ; invariant.
  (defun update-st (... st ...)
    (declare (xargs :stobjs st
                    :guard (and (good-stp st) ...)))
    ...)
  ...

  ; Prove that the invariant is indeed preserved by those basic functions.
  (defthm good-stp-update-st
    (implies (and (good-stp st)
                  ...)
             (good-stp (update-st ... st ...))))
  ...

  ; Implement algorithms built on the basic functions.
  (defun foo (... st ...)
    (declare (xargs :stobjs st
                    :guard (and (good-stp st) ...)))
    ... (update-st ... st ...) ...)

  ; Prove invariance theorems about these algorithms.
  (defthm good-stp-foo
    (implies (and (good-stp st)
                  ...)
             (good-stp (foo ... st ...))))

  But there are at least two potential difficulties in using stobjs as
  described above.
  ~bq[]
  1. When ~c[foo] is executed on concrete data in the ACL2 loop, the guard
  check may be expensive because ~c[(good-stp st)] is expensive.

  2. Reasoning about ~c[foo] (using rules like ~c[foo-is-correct] above)
  involves proving hypotheses of invariance theorems, which may be complicated
  for the user to manage or slow for the theorem prover.~eq[]

  The ~c[defabsstobj] event offers an opportunity to address these issues.  It
  introduces a new stobj, which we call an ``abstract stobj'', which is
  associated with a corresponding ``concrete stobj'' introduced by an earlier
  ~ilc[defstobj] event.  The ~c[defabsstobj] event specifies a logical
  (~c[:LOGIC]) and an executable (~c[:EXEC]) definition for each primitive
  operation, or ``stobj primitive'', involving that stobj.  As is the case for
  ~ilc[defstobj], the logical definition is what ACL2 reasons about, and is
  appropriate to apply to an ACL2 object satisfying the logical definition of
  the recognizer function for the stobj.  The executable definition is applied
  in raw Lisp to a live stobj, which is an array object associated with the
  given stobj name.

  We can picture a sequence of updates to corresponding abstract and concrete
  stobjs as follows.  Initially in this picture, ~c[st$a0] and ~c[st$c0] are a
  corresponding abstract and concrete stobj (respectively).  Then an update,
  ~c[u1], is applied with ~c[:LOGIC] and ~c[:EXEC] functions ~c[u$a1] and
  ~c[u$c1], respectively.  The resulting abstract and concrete stobj, ~c[st$a1]
  and ~c[st$c1], correspond as before.  Then a second update, ~c[u2], is
  applied with ~c[:LOGIC] and ~c[:EXEC] functions ~c[u$a2] and ~c[u$c2],
  respectively ~-[] again preserving the correspondence.  And so on.

  We conclude this introduction with some remarks about implementation.
  Consider an abstract stobj ~c[st] with corresponding concrete stobj ~c[st$c].
  The live stobjs for ~c[st] and ~c[st$c] have the same structure, but are
  distinct arrays.  Indeed, the raw Lisp creator function for ~c[st$c] is
  called to create a new initial live stobj for ~c[st].  As we will see below,
  reads and writes in raw Lisp to the live stobj for ~c[st] are ultimately
  performed using the primitive accessors and updaters defined for ~c[st$c].
  One might think of the live stobjs for ~c[st] and ~c[st$c] as being congruent
  stobjs (~pl[defstobj]), except that the stobjs themselves are not congruent:
  the stobj primitives introduced for ~c[st] may be applied to ~c[st] but not
  arbitrary field updaters of ~c[st$c], for example.  As one might expect, the
  ~c[:EXEC] function for an exported function is applied to the live stobj for
  ~c[st] in raw Lisp.

  ~st[EXAMPLE]

  We present examples, with detailed comments intended to explain abstract
  stobjs, in two community books: ~c[books/misc/defabsstobj-example-1.lisp] and
  ~c[books/misc/defabsstobj-example-2.lisp].  In this section we outline the
  first of these.  We suggest that after you finish this ~il[documentation]
  topic, you read through those two books.

  Here is the first of two closely related ~c[defabsstobj] ~il[events] from the
  book ~c[defabsstobj-example-1.lisp], but in expanded form.  We will show the
  abbreviated form later, which omits most of data in the form that is
  immediately below.  Thus most of the information shown here is default
  information.  We believe that the comments below explain most or all of what
  you need to know in order to start using ~c[defabsstobj], and that you will
  learn the remainder when you see error messages.  For example, we do not say
  in the comments below that every ~c[:LOGIC] and ~c[:EXEC] function must be
  ~il[guard]-verified, but that is indeed a requirement.

  (defabsstobj st ; The new abstract stobj is named st.

  ; The concrete stobj corresponding to st is st$c:

  ; st$ap in the logic, and is executed on the live stobj in raw Lisp using
  ; st$cp.

    :recognizer (stp :logic st$ap :exec st$cp)

  ; The initial stobj is defined as create-st (a function of no arguments),
  ; which is defined logically as create-st$a, though create-st$c is invoked to

  ~ev[]

  Note that all stobj primitives (recognizer, creator, and exported functions)
  are defined in the ACL2 loop in terms of their ~c[:LOGIC] functions and in
  raw Lisp in terms of their ~c[:EXEC] functions.  In the ACL2 loop, a
  ~ilc[defun] form defines a function, while in raw Lisp, a ~ilc[defmacro] form
  defines a macro (for efficiency).  We first illustrate how that works for the
  recognizer.  (You can see all the logical and executable definitions by
  evaluating the form
  ~c[(trace$ defabsstobj-axiomatic-defs defabsstobj-raw-defs)] before
  evaluating the ~ilc[defstobj] form.)
  ~bv[]
  ; In the ACL2 loop:
  (defun stp (st)
    (declare (xargs :guard 't))
    (st$ap st))

  ; In raw Lisp:
  (defmacro stp (&rest args) (cons 'st$cp args))
  ~ev[]

  The definitions are made similarly for exported functions, with ~il[guard]s
  derived from their ~c[:LOGIC] functions as follows.  Consider the exported
  function ~c[update] in our example.  Its ~c[:LOGIC] function, ~c[update$a],
  has formals ~c[(k val st$a)] and the following guard.
  ~bv[]
  (and (and (integerp k) (<= 0 k) (<= k 49))
       (and (integerp val) (<= 0 val))
       (st$ap st$a)
       (mem$c-entryp val))
  ~ev[]
  The formals of ~c[update] are obtained by starting with the formals of its
  ~c[:EXEC] function, ~c[update-mem$ci] ~-[] which are ~c[(i v st$c)] ~-[] and
  replacing the concrete stobj name ~c[st$c] by the new stobj name ~c[st].  The
  formals of ~c[update] are thus ~c[(i v st)].  The guard for ~c[update] is
  obtained in two steps.  The first step is to substitute the formals of
  ~c[update] for the formals of ~c[update$a] in the guard for ~c[update$a], to
  obtain the following.
  ~bv[]
  (and (and (integerp i) (<= 0 i) (<= i 49))
       (and (integerp v) (<= 0 v))
       (st$ap st)
       (mem$c-entryp v))
  ~ev[]
  The second step is to replace, for each new stobj primitive ~c[p], the
  ~c[:LOGIC] function for ~c[p] by ~c[p] itself.  The only ~c[:LOGIC] function
  occurring in the formula just above is ~c[st$ap], which is the ~c[:LOGIC]
  funcction for ~c[stp].  The guard for ~c[update] is thus as follows.
  ~bv[]
  (and (and (integerp i) (<= 0 i) (<= i 49))
       (and (integerp v) (<= 0 v))
       (stp st)
       (mem$c-entryp v))
  ~ev[]

  We turn now to the proof obligations, as promised above.  There are three
  types: ~c[:CORRESPONDENCE], ~c[:PRESERVED], and ~c[:GUARD-THM].  All required
  lemmas may be printed simply by defining the necessary ~c[:LOGIC] and
  ~c[:EXEC] functions and then submitting the ~c[defabsstobj] event.
  (To advanced users: also ~pl[defabsstobj-missing-events] for a utility that
  returns the required formulas in translated form.)  Although the
  ~c[defabsstobj] event will fail if the required lemmas have not been proved,
  first it will print the ~ilc[defthm] forms that must be admitted in order to
  complete submission of the ~c[defabsstobj] event.

  The detailed theory explaining the need for these lemmas may be found in a
  comment in ACL2 source file ~c[other-events.lisp], in a comment entitled
  ``Essay on the Correctness of Abstract Stobjs''.  Here, we give an informal
  sense of the importance of these lemmas as we present examples of them.
  Fundamental is the notion of evaluation in the logic versus evaluation using
  live stobjs, where one imagines tracking the current value of each abstract
  stobj during each of these two evaluations.

  We start with the ~c[:CORRESPONDENCE] lemmas.  These guarantee that
  evaluation in the logic agrees with evaluation using live stobjs, in the
  sense that the only difference is between a logical stobj and a live stobj,
  where the two correspond in the sense of the function specified by
  ~c[:CORR-FN].  We start with the ~c[:CREATOR] function where the statement is
  quite simple, stating that the ~c[:CORR-FN] holds initially.
  ~bv[]
  (defthm create-st{correspondence}
    (st$corr (create-st$c) (create-st$a)))
  ~ev[]
  For the exported functions, there are essentially two cases.  If an exported
  function returns other than the new abstract stobj, then the theorem asserts
  the equality of the results of applying the ~c[:LOGIC] and ~c[:EXEC]
  functions for the exported function.  Hypotheses include the ~c[:CORR-FN]
  correspondence followed by the ~il[guard] for the ~c[:LOGIC] function, which
  is stated in terms of the formal parameters of the ~c[:EXEC] function except
  using the abstract stobj (here, ~c[st]) in place of the concrete stobj (here,
  ~c[st$c]).  The conclusion uses the ~c[:EXEC] formals, modified in the call
  of the ~c[:LOGIC] function (here, ~c[lookup$a]) to use the abstract stobj, as
  in the hypotheses.
  ~bv[]
  (defthm lookup{correspondence}
    (implies (and (st$corr st$c st)
                  (integerp i) (<= 0 i) (<= i 49)
                  (st$ap st))
             (equal (mem$ci i st$c)
                    (lookup$a i st)))
    :rule-classes nil)
  ~ev[]
  By contrast, if the exported function returns the new abstract stobj, then
  the conclusion uses the correspondence function insted of ~c[EQUAL], as in
  the following.
  ~bv[]
  (defthm update{correspondence}
    (implies (and (st$corr st$c st)
                  (integerp i) (<= 0 i) (<= i 49)
                  (integerp v) (<= 0 v)
                  (st$ap st)
                  (mem$c-entryp v))
             (st$corr (update-mem$ci i v st$c)
                      (update$a i v st)))
    :rule-classes nil)
  ~ev[]
  For exported functions that return multiple values, such conclusions are
  conjoined together over the returned values.

  The ~c[:PRESERVED] lemmas guarantee that updates to the abstract stobj
  preserve its recognizer.  The fact that every exported function has this
  property provides justification for an optimization performed by ACL2 during
  generation of proof obligations for ~il[guard] verification, by assuming that
  the recognizer always holds.  The ~c[:PRESERVED] lemma for the ~c[:CREATOR]
  shows that the recognizer holds initially.
  ~bv[]
  (defthm create-st{preserved}
    (st$ap (create-st$a)))
  ~ev[]
  Here is a typical such lemma, for the exported function ~c[update].  Note
  that there is no such lemma for ~c[lookup], since ~c[lookup] does not return
  ~c[st].
  ~bv[]
  (defthm update{preserved}
    (implies (and (integerp i) (<= 0 i) (<= i 49)
                  (integerp v) (<= 0 v)
                  (st$ap st)
                  (mem$c-entryp v))
             (st$ap (update$a i v st))))
  ~ev[]

  Finally, we consider the ~c[:GUARD-THM] lemmas.  These serve to guarantee
  that the ~il[guard] holds for each call of an ~c[:EXEC] function.  During
  guard verification, logical definitions are used; in particular, since each
  exported function is defined in the logic as the corresponding call of its
  ~c[:LOGIC] function, guard verification shows that each call of the
  ~c[:LOGIC] function for an exported function satisfies that function's guard.
  But why is this true for raw Lisp evaluation using live stobjs, where the
  ~c[:EXEC] function is called for an exported function?  The ~c[:GUARD-THM]
  lemmas provide the answer, as they state that if the ~c[:LOGIC] function's
  guard holds, then the ~c[:EXEC] function's guard holds.  Here is an example.
  Note that the hypotheses come from the correspondence of the concrete and
  abstract function as guaranteed by the ~c[:CORR] function, together with the
  guard of the ~c[:LOGIC] function; and the conclusion comes from the guard of
  the ~c[:EXEC] function.
  ~bv[]
  (defthm lookup{guard-thm}
    (implies (and (st$corr st$c c)
                  (integerp i)
                  (<= 0 i)
                  (<= i 49)
                  (st$ap st))
             (and (integerp i)
                  (<= 0 i)
                  (< i (mem$c-length st$c))))
    :rule-classes nil)

  We conclude this EXAMPLE section by showing a short form for the

  ~st[SUMMARY DOCUMENTATION]

  The General Form is as shown below, where the order of keywords is unimportant.
  Duplicate keywords are discouraged; while permitted, only the first
  (leftmost) occurrence of a given keyword is used.  Only the ~c[:exports]
  keyword is required.
  ~bv[]

  ~ev[]
  The keyword argument ~c[:EXPORTS] must be supplied, and missing or ~c[nil]
  keyword arguments have defaults as indicated below.  All arguments must
  satisfy the conditions below.

  Before we describe the arguments, we define a notion of a ``function spec''
  and its ``completion''.  A function spec is either a symbol or else a list of
  the form
  ~bv[]
  (fn ~c[:kwd1] val1 ... ~c[:kwdn] valn),
  ~ev[]
  that is, a symbol followed by a ~ilc[keyword-value-listp].  We view the case
  of a symbol, ~c[s], as the function spec ~c[(s)], with no keywords.  There
  must be no duplicate keywords.  In each case that we expect a function spec,
  the context provides a set of valid keywords for that function spec; it is an
  error to provide any other keyword in the function spec.  Each function spec
  is interpreted as its ``completion'', obtained by extending the function spec
  with a default value for each valid keyword as indicated below.  With that
  interpretation, the ``exported function'' of a function spec is its ~c[car],
  and that function symbol and each keyword value must be a guard-verified
  function symbol; and moreover, the ~c[:EXEC] function must not include the
  new abstract stobj name, ~c[st], among its formals.

  We are ready to describe the arguments of ~c[defabsstobj].
  ~bq[]
  ~c[St] is a symbol, which names the new abstract stobj.

  ~c[Concrete] is the name of an existing stobj that is not an abstract stobj,
  i.e., was introduced with ~ilc[defstobj] (not ~ilc[defabsstobj]).

  ~c[Recognizer] is a function spec (for the recognizer function).  The valid
  keywords are ~c[:LOGIC] and ~c[:EXEC].  The default for ~c[recognizer] is
  obtained by adding the suffix ~c[\"P\"] to ~c[name].  The default value for
  ~c[:LOGIC] is formed by adding the suffix ~c[\"$AP\"] to ~c[recognizer]; for
  ~c[:EXEC], by adding the suffix ~c[\"$CP\"].  The ~c[:EXEC] function must be
  the recognizer for the specified ~c[:CONCRETE] stobj.

  ~c[Creator] is a function spec (for the creator function).  The valid
  keywords are ~c[:LOGIC] and ~c[:EXEC].  The default for ~c[creator] is
  obtained by adding the prefix ~c[\"CREATE-\"] to ~c[name].  The default value
  for ~c[:LOGIC] is formed by adding the suffix ~c[\"$A\"] to ~c[creator]; for
  ~c[:EXEC], by adding the suffix ~c[\"$C\"].  The ~c[:CREATOR] function must
  be the creator for the specified ~c[:CONCRETE] stobj, as ACL2 checks that the
  ~c[:CREATOR] function takes no arguments and returns the ~c[:CONCRETE] stobj.

  ~c[Corr-fn] is a known function symbol that takes two arguments (for the
  correspondence theorems).  The default for ~c[corr-fn] is obtained by adding
  the suffix ~c[\"$CORR\"] to ~c[name].

  ~c[Congruent-to] should either be ~c[nil] (the default) or the name of an
  abstract stobj previously introduced (by ~ilc[defabsstobj]).  In the latter
  case, the current and previous abstract stobj should have the same concrete
  stobj (not merely congruent concrete stobjs), and their ~c[:EXPORTS] fields
  should have the same length and also correspond, as follows: the ith export
  of each should have the same ~c[:LOGIC] and ~c[:EXEC] symbols.  ~l[defstobj]
  for more about congruent stobjs.  Note that if two names are congruent, then
  they are either both ordinary stobjs or both abstract stobjs.

  ~c[Protect-default] should either be ~c[nil] (th default) or ~c[t].  It
  provides the value of keyword ~c[:PROTECT] for each member of ~c[exports]
  that does not explicitly specify ~c[:PROTECT].  See the discussion of
  ~c[exports] below.

  An important aspect of the ~c[congruent-to] parameter is that if it is not
  ~c[nil], then the checks for lemmas ~-[] ~c[{CORRESPONDENCE}],
  ~c[{GUARD-THM}], and ~c[{PRESERVED}] ~-[] are omitted.  Thus, the values of
  keyword ~c[:CORR-FN], and the values of keywords ~c[:CORRESPONDENCE],
  ~c[:GUARD-THM], and ~c[:PRESERVED] in each export (as we discuss next), are
  irrelevant; they are not inferred and they need not be supplied.

  The value of ~c[:EXPORTS] is a non-empty true list.  Each ~c[ei] is a
  function spec (for an exported function).  The valid keywords are ~c[:LOGIC],
  ~c[:EXEC], ~c[:CORRESPONDENCE], and ~c[:GUARD-THM], ~c[:PROTECT], and also
  ~c[:PRESERVED] if and only if the specified ~c[:EXEC] function returns the
  ~c[:CONCRETE] stobj.  The default values for all of these keywords except
  ~c[:PROTECT] are obtained by respectively adding the suffix ~c[\"$A\"]
  ~c[\"$C\"], ~c[\"{CORRESPONDENCE}\"], ~c[\"{GUARD-THM}\"], or
  ~c[\"{PRESERVED}\"].  For ~c[:PROTECT], the default is ~c[nil] unless the
  ~c[defabsstobj] event specifies ~c[:PROTECT-DEFAULT t].

  ~c[Doc], if non-~c[nil], is a ~il[documentation] string
  (~pl[doc-string]).~eq[]

  Not shown is the keyword, ~c[:MISSING]; the effect of ~c[:missing t] is to
  turn the call of ~c[defabsstobj] into a corresponding call of
  ~ilc[defabsstobj-missing-events].

  Note that a ~c[defabsstobj] event will fail if the required lemmas ~-[] that
  is, those for valid keywords ~c[:CORRESPONDENCE], ~c[:GUARD-THM], and
  ~c[:PRESERVED] ~-[] have not been proved, unless proofs are being skipped.
  The exemption when skipping proofs allows the supporting lemmas to be
  ~ilc[local] to ~il[books] and ~ilc[encapsulate] ~il[events].  If the ~ilc[ld]
  special ~ilc[ld-skip-proofsp] is ~c[t], then the missing ~il[events] are
  printed with a warning before the ~c[defabsstobj] event is admitted; but if
  ~c[ld-skip-proofsp] is the symbol ~c[INCLUDE-BOOK], then that warning is
  omitted.  (Also ~pl[skip-proofs] and ~pl[ld-skip-proofsp].)  If however
  proofs are not being skipped, then the ~c[defabsstobj] event will fail after
  printing the missing events.  Advanced users may wish to
  ~pl[defabsstobj-missing-events] for a utility that returns a data structure
  containing the missing lemmas.

  Let ~c[st] be an abstract stobj with corresponding concrete stobj ~c[st$c].
  let ~c[f] be an exported function for ~c[st] and let ~c[f$a] and ~c[f$c] be
  the corresponding ~c[:LOGIC] and ~c[:EXEC] functions, respectively.  The
  formals of ~c[f] are obtained by taking the formals of ~c[f$c] and replacing
  ~c[st$c] by ~c[st].  The ~il[guard] for ~c[f] is derived as follows from the
  guard of ~c[f$a].  First, the formals of ~c[f$a] are replaced by the formals
  of ~c[f] in the guard of ~c[f$a], to obtain a term we denote here as
  ~c[guard-pre].  Now for each exported function symbol ~c[g] of ~c[st] with
  corresponding ~c[:LOGIC] function ~c[g$a], form a functional substitution by
  consing ~c[g$a] with ~c[g].  Finally, apply that functional substitution to
  ~c[guard-pre]; the result is the guard of ~c[f].  That guard must satisfy the
  usual conditions of a guard: thus, it must return a single non-~il[stobj]
  value and satisfy normal syntactic restrictions, including
  single-threadedness in its handling of stobjs.

  ~c[Remark].  Because of how guards are created for exported functions, and in
  particular because ~c[:LOGIC] functions are replaced as discussed above, a
  good discipline is to define ~c[:LOGIC] functions that are not intended for
  general use, but are intended only for use as ~c[:LOGIC] functions of
  corresponding stobj primitives.  For example, suppose that you use ~c[length]
  as the ~c[:LOGIC] function for some stobj primitive, ~c[f] (as opposed to
  using your own function, say, ~c[foo-length] or ~c[foo$a]).  Then every call
  of ~c[length] will be replaced by ~c[f] when creating the guard of a stobj
  primitive from the guard of its ~c[:LOGIC] function.  This might not be what
  you intended if you were using ~c[length] in that guard simply to compute the
  length of an ordinary list.

  There are a few additional restrictions, as follows.

  ~bq[]
  All exported function names must be new (unless redefinition is on;
  ~pl[ld-redefinition-action]), and there must be no duplicates among them.

  The ~c[:CONCRETE] stobj name must be a formal parameter of the ~c[:EXEC] fn
  of every function spec, except for the ~c[:CREATOR] function spec.  Also the
  input signatures of the ~c[:LOGIC] and ~c[:EXEC] function for a function spec
  must agree, except perhaps at the position of that ~c[:CONCRETE] formal.

  For function specs other than the ~c[:CREATOR] function spec, the output
  signatures of the ~c[:LOGIC] and ~c[:EXEC] functions must have the same
  length and must agree, except perhaps at position ~c[p_out] of the
  ~c[:CONCRETE] stobj in the ~c[:EXEC] function's output.  If ~c[p_in] is the
  position of the ~c[:CONCRETE] stobj in the ~c[:EXEC] function's formals, then
  the ~c[:LOGIC] function's output at position ~c[p_out] should match the
  ~c[:LOGIC] function's formal at position ~c[p_in].

  The ~c[:PROTECT] keyword is something that you should ignore unless you get
  an error message about it, pertaining to modifying the concrete stobj
  non-atomically.  In that case, you can eliminate the error by providing
  ~c[:PROTECT t] in the function spec, or by providing ~c[defabsstobj] keyword
  argument ~c[:PROTECT-DEFAULT t] at the top level.  The above explanation is
  probably all you need to know about ~c[:PROTECT], but just below is a more
  complete explanation for those who desire it.  Further information is also
  available if you need it; ~pl[set-absstobj-debug], and see the example uses
  of these keywords in community book
  ~c[books/misc/defabsstobj-example-2.lisp].~eq[]

  For those who are interested, here is a more detailed discussion of
  ~c[:PROTECT] and ~c[:PROTECT-DEFAULT], as promised above.  It applies to any
  function spec for an export (hence not to the ~c[:CREATOR] function spec).
  If the ~c[:EXEC] function is a stobj primitive, then clearly the following
  property holds: any execution of a call of that function can only update the
  concrete stobj at most once ~-[] i.e., modification of the concrete stobj is
  atomic.  ACL2 can deduce this property not only for stobj primitives but for
  many other functions as well.  However, if ACL2 cannot deduce this property,
  then it will cause an error saying that the ~c[:EXEC] function ``appears
  capable of modifying the concrete stobj, ~c[<stobj_name>], non-atomically.''
  That message also explains how to eliminate this error: provide
  ~c[:PROTECT t] for the function spec.  Alternatively, all function specs
  without an explicit ~c[:PROTECT] keyword can be implicitly supplied
  ~c[:PROTECT t] by supplying the value ~c[t] for the ~c[:PROTECT-DEFAULT]
  keyword parameter of the ~c[defabsstobj] event.  However, beware that when
  ~c[:PROTECT] is ~c[t], the generated raw Lisp code runs slightly less
  efficiently ~-[] though perhaps with negligible efficiency loss if the
  ~c[:EXEC] function is not trivial.  Community books
  ~c[books/misc/defabsstobj-example-3.lisp] and
  ~c[books/misc/defabsstobj-example-4.lisp] provide related information.

  We conclude with some remarks.

  Unlike ~ilc[defstobj], there is no ~c[:renaming] argument.  Instead, the
  scheme described above provides a flexible way to assign names.

  Those who use the experimental extension ACL2(h), which includes function
  memoization (~pl[memoize]), may be aware that the memo table for a function
  is flushed whenever it is the case that one of its stobj inputs is updated.
  In fact, such flushing happens even when a stobj that is congruent to one of
  its stobj inputs is updated.  For that purpose, an abstract stobj is
  considered to be congruent to its corresponding concrete stobj.

  obtain the ~il[events] needed to admit a ~ilc[defabsstobj] event~/

  We assume familiarity with ~ilc[defabsstobj].  ~c[Defabsstobj-missing-events]
  is a macro is for advanced users (who, for example, understand the role of
  the ~c[translate] and ~c[untranslate] functions), who want programmatic
  access to the ~ilc[defthm] events required to admit a specific
  ~c[defabsstobj] event.~/

  This macro has the same syntax as ~ilc[defabsstobj] ~-[] to use it, just
  replace a call of ~ilc[defabsstobj] by a call of
  ~c[defabsstobj-missing-events] on the same arguments.  The result is an error
  triple ~c[(mv erp val state)].  If ~c[erp] is ~c[nil], then ~c[val] is the
  list of all objects ~c[(name formula . old-formula)], where a ~ilc[defthm]
  event named ~c[name] remains to be admitted whose translated formula is
  ~c[formula], and where ~c[old-formula] is ~c[nil] unless the indicated event
  already exists (hence with a different formula), in which case
  ~c[old-formula] is the existing translated formula.

  To build a ~ilc[defthm] event from the above value, ~c[val], we suggest
  evaluating a form like ~c[(untranslate formula t (w state))].~/"

  single-threaded objects or ``von Neumann bottlenecks''~/

  In ACL2, a ``single-threaded object'' is a data structure whose use is so
  syntactically restricted that only one instance of the object need ever exist
  and its fields can be updated by destructive assignments.

  Note: Novices are advised to avoid using single-threaded objects, perhaps
  instead using community book ~c[books/data-structures/structures.lisp].  At
  the least, consider using ~c[(]~ilc[set-verify-guards-eagerness]~c[ 0)] to
  avoid ~il[guard] verification.

  The documentation in this section is laid out in the form of a tour that
  visits the documented topics in a reasonable order.  We recommend that you
  follow the tour the first time you read about stobjs.  The list of all stobj
  topics is shown below.  The tour starts immediately afterwards.  Also
  ~pl[defstobj] and, for so-called abstract stobjs, ~pl[defabsstobj].~/

  As noted, a ``single-threaded object'' is a data structure whose use is so
  syntactically restricted that only one instance of the object need ever
  exist.  Updates to the object must be sequentialized.  This allows us to
  update its fields with destructive assignments without wrecking the axiomatic
  semantics of update-by-copy.  For this reason, single-threaded objects are
  sometimes called ``von Neumann bottlenecks.''

  From the logical perspective, a single-threaded object is an ordinary ACL2
  object, e.g., composed of integers and conses.  Logically speaking, ordinary
  ACL2 functions are defined to allow the user to ``access'' and ``update'' its
  fields.  Logically speaking, when fields in the object, obj, are ``updated''
  with new values, a new object, obj', is constructed.

  But suppose that by syntactic means we could ensure that there were no more
  references to the ``old'' object, obj.  Then we could create obj' by
  destructively modifying the memory locations involved in the representation
  of obj.  The syntactic means is pretty simple but draconian: the only
  reference to obj is in the variable named ~c[OBJ].

  The consequences of this simple rule are far-reaching and require some
  getting used to.  For example, if ~c[OBJ] has been declared as a
  single-threaded object name, then the following consequences ensue (but see
  the discussion of congruent stobjs below for a slight relaxation).

  o ~c[OBJ] is a top-level global variable that contains the current object,
  obj.

  o If a function uses the formal parameter ~c[OBJ], the only ``actual
  expression'' that can be passed into that slot is the variable ~c[OBJ], not
  merely a term that ``evaluates to an obj''; thus, such functions can only
  operate on the current object.  So for example, instead of
  ~c[(FOO (UPDATE-FIELD1 3 ST))] write
  ~c[(LET ((ST (UPDATE-FIELD1 3 ST))) (FOO ST))].

  o The accessors and updaters have a formal parameter named ~c[OBJ], so by the
  rule just above, those functions can only be applied to the current object.
  The recognizer is the one exception to the rule: it may be applied either the
  ~c[OBJ] or to an ordinary (non-stobj) object.

  o The ACL2 primitives, such as ~c[CONS], ~c[CAR] and ~c[CDR], may not be
  applied to the variable ~c[OBJ].  Thus, for example, obj may not be consed
  into a list (which would create another pointer to it) or accessed or copied
  via ``unapproved'' means.

  o The updaters return a ``new ~c[OBJ] object'', i.e., obj'; thus, when an
  updater is called, the only variable which can hold its result is ~c[OBJ].

  o If a function calls an ~c[OBJ] updater, it must return an ~c[OBJ] object
  (either as the sole value returned, or in ~c[(mv ... OBJ ...)]; ~pl[mv]).

  o When a top-level expression involving ~c[OBJ] returns an ~c[OBJ] object,
  that object becomes the new current value of ~c[OBJ].

  There are other functional languages supporting single-threadedness, for
  example Haskell's ``monads'' and Clean's ``uniqueness type system''.  Of
  course, ACL2 provides a theorem prover that can prove theorems that involve
  such constructs.

  Note that the syntactic restrictions noted above are enforced only when
  single-threaded objects are encountered directly in the top-level loop or are
  used in function definitions; the accessor and update functions for
  single-threaded objects may be used without restriction in formulas to be
  proved.  Since function evaluation is sometimes necessary during proofs, ACL2
  must be able to evaluate these functions on logical constants representing
  the object, even when the constant is not ``the current object.''  Thus, ACL2
  supports both the efficient von Neumann semantics and the clean applicative
  semantics, and uses the first in contexts where execution speed is paramount
  and the second during proofs.

  ~ilc[Defstobj] and ~ilc[defabsstobj] ~il[events] introduce stobjs.
  ~l[defstobj] for more details about stobjs.  In particular, a relatively
  advanced notion of ``congruent stobjs'' is discussed there.  The idea is to
  allow a stobj, ~c[st2], of the same ``shape'' as a given stobj, ~c[st1], to
  be used in place of ~c[st1].  Other ~ilc[defstobj] keywords allow inlining
  and renaming of stobj accessors and updaters.

  But we are getting ahead of ourselves.  To start the stobj tour,

  an example of the use of single-threaded objects~/

  Suppose we want to sweep a tree and (1) count the number of interior
  nodes, (2) count the number of tips and (3) keep a record of every
  tip we encounter that is an integer.  We could use a single-threaded
  object as our ``accumulator''.  Such an object would have three
  fields, one holding the number of nodes seen so far, one holding the
  number of tips, and one holding all the integer tips seen.~/

  The following event declares ~c[counters] to be a single-threaded object.
  ~bv[]
  (defstobj counters
    (NodeCnt     :type integer :initially 0)
    (TipCnt      :type integer :initially 0)
    (IntTipsSeen :type t       :initially nil))
  ~ev[]
  It has three fields, ~c[NodeCnt], ~c[TipCnt], and ~c[IntTipsSeen].
  (As always in ACL2, capitalization is irrelevant in simple symbol
  names, so the first name could be written ~c[nodecnt] or
  ~c[NODECNT], etc.) Those are the name of the accessor functions for
  the object.  The corresponding update functions are named
  ~c[update-NodeCnt], ~c[update-TipCnt] and ~c[update-IntTipsSeen].

  If you do not like the default function names chosen above, there is
  a feature in the ~ilc[defstobj] event that allows you to specify other
  names.

  If you want to see the ACL2 definitions of all the functions defined
  by this event, look at ~il[stobj-example-1-defuns].

  If, after this event, we evaluate the top-level ``global variable''
  ~c[counters] in the ACL2 read-eval-print loop we get:
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>counters
  <counters>
  ~ev[]
  Note that the value printed is ``~c[<counters>]''.  Actually, the
  value of ~c[counters] in the logic is ~c[(0 0 NIL)].  But ACL2 always prints
  single-threaded objects in this non-informative way because they are
  usually so big that to do otherwise would be unpleasant.

  Had you tried to evaluate the ``global variable'' ~c[counters] before
  declaring it a single-threaded object, ACL2 would have complained that
  it does not support global variables.  So a lesson here is that
  once you have declared a new single-threaded object your top-level
  forms can reference it.  In versions of ACL2 prior to Version  2.4
  the only variable enjoying this status was ~c[STATE].  single-threaded
  objects are a straightforward generalization of the long-implemented
  von Neumann ~ilc[state] feature of ACL2.

  We can access the fields of ~c[counters] as with:
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>(NodeCnt counters)
  0
  ACL2 !>(IntTipsSeen counters)  
  NIL
  ~ev[]
  and we can set the fields of ~c[counters] as with:
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>(update-NodeCnt 3 counters)
  <counters>
  ACL2 !>(NodeCnt counters)
  3  
  ~ev[]
  Observe that when we evaluate an expression that returns a
  counter object, that object becomes the ``current value'' of
  ~c[counters].  

  Here is a function that ``converts'' the ~c[counters] object to its
  ``ordinary'' representation:
  ~bv[]
  (defun show-counters (counters)
    (declare (xargs :stobjs (counters)))
    (list (NodeCnt counters)
          (TipCnt counters)
          (IntTipsSeen counters)))
  ~ev[]
  Observe that we ~em[must] declare, at the top of the ~c[defun], that
  we mean to use the formal parameter ~c[counters] as a single-threaded
  object!  If we did not make this declaration, the body of
  ~c[show-counters] would be processed as though ~c[counters] were an
  ordinary object.  An error would be caused because the accessors
  used above cannot be applied to anything but the single-threaded
  object ~c[counters].  If you want to know why we insist on this
  declaration, ~pl[declare-stobjs].

  When ~c[show-counters] is admitted, the following message is printed:
  ~bv[]
  Since SHOW-COUNTERS is non-recursive, its admission is trivial.  We
  observe that the type of SHOW-COUNTERS is described by the theorem
  (AND (CONSP (SHOW-COUNTERS COUNTERS))
       (TRUE-LISTP (SHOW-COUNTERS COUNTERS))).
  We used primitive type reasoning.

  (SHOW-COUNTERS COUNTERS) => *.

  The guard conjecture for SHOW-COUNTERS is trivial to prove.  
  SHOW-COUNTERS is compliant with Common Lisp.
  ~ev[]
  The line above containing the ``=>'' is called the ``signature'' of
  ~c[show-counters]; it conveys the information that the first argument
  is the single-threaded object ~c[counters] and the only result is an
  ordinary object.  Here is an example of another signature:
  ~bv[]
  (PROCESSOR * * COUNTERS) => (MV * COUNTERS)
  ~ev[]
  which indicates that the function ~c[PROCESSOR] (which we haven't
  shown you) takes three arguments, the third of which is the 
  ~c[COUNTERS] stobj, and returns two results, the second of which
  is the modified ~c[COUNTERS].

  Returning to the admission of ~c[show-counters] above, the last
  sentence printed indicates that the ~ilc[guard] conjectures for the
  function were proved.  When some argument of a function is declared
  to be a single-threaded object via the ~c[xargs] ~c[:stobj], we
  automatically add (conjoin) to the guard the condition that the
  argument satisfy the recognizer for that single-threaded object.  In
  the case of ~c[show-counters] the guard is ~c[(countersp counters)].

  Here is an example of ~c[show-counters] being called:
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>(show-counters counters)
  (3 0 NIL)
  ~ev[]
  This is what we would see had we set the ~c[NodeCnt] field of the
  initial value of ~c[counters] to ~c[3], as we did earlier in this
  example.

  We next wish to define a function to reset the ~c[counters] object.
  We could define it this way:
  ~bv[]
  (defun reset-counters (counters)
    (declare (xargs :stobjs (counters)))
    (let ((counters (update-NodeCnt 0 counters)))
      (let ((counters (update-TipCnt 0 counters)))
        (update-IntTipsSeen nil counters))))
  ~ev[]
  which ``successively'' sets the ~c[NodeCnt] field to ~c[0], then the
  ~c[TipCnt] field to ~c[0], and then the ~c[IntTipsSeen] field to ~c[nil] and
  returns the resulting object.

  However, the nest of ~c[let] expressions is tedious and we use this
  definition instead.  This definition exploits a macro, here named
  ``~c[seq]'' (for ``sequentially'') which evaluates each of the forms
  given, binding their results successively to the stobj name given.  
  ~bv[]
  (defun reset-counters (counters)
    (declare (xargs :stobjs (counters)))
    (seq counters
         (update-NodeCnt 0 counters)
         (update-TipCnt 0 counters)
         (update-IntTipsSeen nil counters)))
  ~ev[]
  This definition is syntactically identical to the one above, after macro
  expansion.  Our definition of ~c[seq] is shown below and is not part of
  native ACL2.
  ~bv[]
  (defmacro seq (stobj &rest rst)
    (cond ((endp rst) stobj)
          ((endp (cdr rst)) (car rst))
          (t `(let ((,stobj ,(car rst)))
               (seq ,stobj ,@(cdr rst))))))
  ~ev[]

  The signature printed for ~c[reset-counters] is
  ~bv[]
  (RESET-COUNTERS COUNTERS) => COUNTERS.
  ~ev[]

  Here is an example.
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>(show-counters counters)
  (3 0 NIL)
  ACL2 !>(reset-counters counters)
  <counters>
  ACL2 !>(show-counters counters)
  (0 0 NIL) 
  ~ev[]

  Here finally is a function that uses ~c[counters] as a single-threaded
  accumulator to collect the desired information about the tree ~c[x].
  ~bv[]
  (defun sweep-tree (x counters)
    (declare (xargs :stobjs (counters)))
    (cond ((atom x)
           (seq counters
                (update-TipCnt (+ 1 (TipCnt counters)) counters)
                (if (integerp x)
                    (update-IntTipsSeen (cons x (IntTipsSeen counters))
                                    counters)
                  counters)))
          (t (seq counters
                  (update-NodeCnt (+ 1 (NodeCnt counters)) counters)
                  (sweep-tree (car x) counters)
                  (sweep-tree (cdr x) counters)))))
  ~ev[]
  We can paraphrase this definition as follows.  If ~c[x] is an atom,
  then increment the ~c[TipCnt] field of ~c[counters] and ~em[then],
  if ~c[x] is an integer, add ~c[x] to the ~c[IntTipsSeen] field, and
  return ~c[counters].  On the other hand, if ~c[x] is not
  an atom, then increment the ~c[NodeCnt] field of ~c[counters], and
  ~em[then] sweep the ~c[car] of ~c[x] and ~em[then] sweep the ~c[cdr]
  of ~c[x] and return the result.

  Here is an example of its execution.  We have displayed the input tree
  in full dot notation so that the number of interior nodes is just the
  number of dots.
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>(sweep-tree '((((a . 1) . (2 . b)) . 3)
                       . (4 . (5 . d)))
                     counters)
  <counters>
  ACL2 !>(show-counters counters)
  (7 8 (5 4 3 2 1))
  ACL2 !>(reset-counters counters)
  <counters>
  ACL2 !>(show-counters counters)
  (0 0 NIL)
  ~ev[]

  The ~c[counters] object has two integer fields and a field whose
  type is unrestricted.  single-threaded objects support other types of
  fields, such as arrays.  We deal with that in the ~il[stobj-example-2].
  But we recommend that you first consider the implementation issues for
  the ~c[counters] example (in ~il[stobj-example-1-implementation]) and
  then consider the proof issues (in ~il[stobj-example-1-proofs]).

  declaring a formal parameter name to be a single-threaded object~/

  When a ~ilc[defun] uses one of its formals as a single-threaded object
  (~il[stobj]), the ~c[defun] ~em[must] include a declaration that the
  formal is to be so used.  An exception is the formal ``~ilc[state],'' which
  if not declared as explained below, may still be used provided an
  appropriate global ``declaration'' is issued:
  ~pl[set-state-ok].~/

  If the formal in question is ~c[counters] then an appropriate declaration
  is
  ~bv[]
  (declare (xargs :stobjs counters))
  ~ev[]
  or, more generally,
  ~bv[]
  (declare (xargs :stobjs (... counters ...)))
  ~ev[]
  where all the single-threaded formals are listed.

  For such a declaration to be legal it must be the case that all the names
  have previously been defined as single-threaded objects with ~ilc[defstobj].

  When an argument is declared to be single-threaded the guard of the
  function is augmented by conjoining to it the condition that the
  argument satisfy the recognizer for the single-threaded object.
  Furthermore, the syntactic checks done to enforce the legal use of
  single-threaded objects are also sufficient to allow these guard
  conjuncts to be automatically proved.

  The obvious question arises:  Why does ACL2 insist that you declare
  stobj names before using them in ~c[defun]s if you can only declare names
  that have already been defined with ~c[defstobj]?  What would go wrong if
  a formal were treated as a single-threaded object if and only if it had
  already been so defined?

  Suppose that one user, say Jones, creates a book in which ~c[counters]
  is defined as a single-threaded object.  Suppose another user, Smith,
  creates a book in which ~c[counters] is used as an ordinary formal
  parameter.  Finally, suppose a third user, Brown, wishes to use both
  books.  If Brown includes Jones' book first and then Smith's, then
  Smith's function treats ~c[counters] as single-threaded.  But if Brown
  includes Smith's book first, the argument is treated as ordinary.

  ACL2 insists on the declaration to ensure that the definition is
  processed the same way no matter what the context.~/")

  Observe that there is a recognizer for each of the three fields and
  then a recognizer for the ~c[counters] object itself.  Then, for each
  field, there is an accessor and an updater.

  Observe also that the functions are guarded so that they expect a
  ~c[countersp] for their ~c[counters] argument and an appropriate value
  for the new field values.

  You can see all of the ~c[defuns] added by a ~c[defstobj] event by
  executing the event and then using the ~c[:pcb!] command on the stobj
  name.  E.g.,
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>:pcb! counters
  ~ev[]
  will print the defuns above.

  We now clear up the ``mystery'' mentioned above.  Note, for example
  in ~c[TipCnt], that the formal ~c[counters] is used.  From the
  discussion in ~il[stobj-example-1] it has been made clear that
  ~c[TipCnt] can only be called on the ~c[counters] object.  And yet,
  in that same discussion it was said that an argument is so treated
  only if it it declared among the ~c[:stobjs] in the definition of
  the function.  So why doesn't ~c[TipCnt] include something like
  ~c[(declare (xargs :stobjs (counters)))]?

  The explanation of this mystery is as follows.  At the time
  ~c[TipCnt] was defined, during the introduction of the ~c[counters]
  stobj, the name ``~c[counters]'' was not yet a single-threaded
  object.  The introduction of a new single-threaded object occurs in
  three steps: (1) The new primitive recognizers, accessors, and
  updaters are introduced as ``ordinary functions,'' producing their
  logical axiomatizations.  (2) The executable counterparts are
  defined in raw Lisp to support destructive updating.  (3) The new
  name is declared a single-threaded object to ensure that all future
  use of these primitives respects the single-threadedness of the
  object.  The functions defined as part of the introduction of a new
  single-threaded object are the only functions in the system that
  have undeclared stobj formals other than ~c[state].

  You may return to ~il[stobj-example-1] here.~/")

          'nil)
  ~ev[]
  and the value is stored in the Common Lisp global variable named
  ~c[*the-live-counters*].
  ~/

  Thus, the ~c[counters] object is an array of length three.  The first
  two elements are arrays of size 1 and are used to hold the
  ~c[NodeCnt] and ~c[TipCnt] fields.  The third element is the
  ~c[IntTipsSeen] field.  The first two fields are represented by
  arrays so that we can implement the ~c[integer] type specification
  efficiently.  Generally, integers are ``boxed'' in some Common Lisp
  implementations, for example, GCL.  Creating a new integer requires
  creating a new box to put it in.  But in some lisps, including GCL,
  the integers inside arrays of integers are not boxed.

  The function ~c[NodeCnt] is defined in raw Lisp as:
  ~bv[]
  (defun NodeCnt (counters)
    (the integer
         (aref (the (simple-array integer (1))
                    (svref counters 0))
               0)))
  ~ev[]
  Observe that the form ~c[(svref counters 0)] is evaluated to get
  an array of size 1, which is followed by a call of ~c[aref] to
  access the 0th element of that array.

  The function ~c[update-NodeCnt] is defined in raw Lisp as:
  ~bv[]
  (defun update-NodeCnt (v counters)
    (declare (type integer v))
    (progn
     (setf (aref (the (simple-array integer (1))
                      (svref counters 0))
                 0)
           (the integer v))
     counters))
  ~ev[]  
  Note that when this function is called, it does not create a new
  vector of length three, but ``smashes'' the existing one.

  One way to see all the raw Lisp functions defined by a given ~c[defstobj] is
  to evaluate the ~c[defstobj] event and then evaluate, in the ACL2 loop, the
  expression ~c[(nth 4 (global-val 'cltl-command (w state)))].  Those functions
  that contain ~c[(DECLARE (STOBJ-INLINE-FN T))] will generate ~ilc[defabbrev]
  forms because the ~c[:inline] keyword of ~ilc[defstobj] was supplied the
  value ~c[t].  The rest will generate ~ilc[defun]s.

  syntactic sugar for
  ~bv[]
  (defun reset-counters (counters)
    (declare (xargs :stobjs (counters)))
    (let ((counters (update-NodeCnt 0 counters)))
      (let ((counters (update-TipCnt 0 counters)))

  ~ev[]

  Here is a simple theorem about ~c[reset-counters].

  ~bv[]
  (defthm reset-counters-is-constant
    (implies (countersp x)
             (equal (reset-counters x)
                    '(0 0 nil))))
  ~ev[]
  ~/
  Before we talk about how to prove this theorem, note that the theorem
  is unusual in two respects.

  First, it calls ~c[reset-counters] on an argument other than the
  variable ~c[counters]!  That is allowed in theorems; logically
  speaking, the stobj functions are indistinguishable from ordinary
  functions.  Their use is syntactically restricted only in
  ~c[defun]s, which might be compiled and run in raw Lisp.  Those
  restrictions allow us to implement stobj modification destructively.
  But logically speaking, ~c[reset-counters] and other stobj
  ``modifying'' functions just create new objects, constructively.

  Second, the theorem above explicitly provides the hypothesis that
  ~c[reset-counters] is being applied to an object satisfying
  ~c[countersp].  Such a hypothesis is not always required:
  ~c[reset-counters] is total and will do something no matter what
  ~c[x] is.  But in this particular case, the result is not ~c['(0 0 nil)]
  unless ~c[x] is, at least, a true-list of length three.

  To make a long story short, to prove theorems about stobj functions you
  behave in exactly the way you would to prove the same theorems about the
  same functions defined without the stobj features.

  How can we prove the above theorem?  Unfolding the definition of
  ~c[reset-counters] shows that ~c[(reset-counters x)] is equal to
  ~bv[]
  (update-IntTipsSeen nil
    (update-TipCnt 0 
      (update-NodeCnt 0 x)))
  ~ev[]
  which in turn is
  ~bv[]
  (update-nth 2 nil
   (update-nth 1 0
    (update-nth 0 0 x))).
  ~ev[]
  Opening up the definition of ~c[update-nth] reduces this to
  ~bv[]
  (list* 0 0 nil (cdddr x)).
  ~ev[]
  This is clearly equal to ~c['(0 0 nil)], provided we know that ~c[(cdddr x)]
  is ~c[nil].

  Unfortunately, that last fact requires a lemma.  The most specific lemma we
  could provide is
  ~bv[]
  (defthm special-lemma-for-counters
    (implies (countersp x)
             (equal (cdddr x) nil)))
  ~ev[]
  but if you try to prove that lemma you will find that it requires some
  reasoning about ~c[len] and ~c[true-listp].  Furthermore, the special
  lemma above is of interest only for ~c[counters].

  The following lemma about ~c[len] is the one we prefer.
  ~bv[]
  (defthm equal-len-n
    (implies (syntaxp (quotep n))
             (equal (equal (len x) n)
                    (if (integerp n)
                        (if (< n 0)
                            nil
                          (if (equal n 0)
                              (atom x)
                            (and (consp x)
                                 (equal (len (cdr x)) (- n 1)))))
                      nil))))
  ~ev[]
  This lemma will simplify any equality in which a ~c[len] expression
  is equated to any explicitly given constant ~em[n], e.g.,
  ~c[3], reducing the equation to a conjunction of ~c[consp] terms
  about the first ~em[n] ~c[cdr]s.

  If the above lemma is available then ACL2 immediately proves
  ~bv[]
  (defthm reset-counters-is-constant
    (implies (countersp x)
             (equal (reset-counters x)
                    '(0 0 nil))))
  ~ev[]

  The point is presumably well made: proving theorems about
  single-threaded object accessors and updaters is no different than
  proving theorems about other recursively defined functions on lists.

  As we have seen, operations on ~il[stobj]s turn into definitions
  involving ~ilc[nth] and ~ilc[update-nth] in the logic.  Here are two lemmas
  that are useful for simplifying terms involving ~c[nth] and ~c[update-nth],
  which are therefore useful in reasoning about single-threaded objects.
  ~bv[]
  (defthm update-nth-update-nth-same
    (implies (equal (nfix i1) (nfix i2))
             (equal (update-nth i1 v1 (update-nth i2 v2 l))
                    (update-nth i1 v1 l))))

  (defthm update-nth-update-nth-diff
    (implies (not (equal (nfix i1) (nfix i2)))
             (equal (update-nth i1 v1 (update-nth i2 v2 l))
                    (update-nth i2 v2 (update-nth i1 v1 l))))
    :rule-classes ((:rewrite :loop-stopper ((i1 i2)))))
  ~ev[]
  These lemmas are due to Matt Wilding.  ~l[nu-rewriter] for a
  discussion of the efficient simplification of terms of the form
  ~c[(nth n (update-nth key val lst))], which can be critical in
  settings involving sequential bindings that commonly arise in

  an example of the use of arrays in single-threaded objects~/
  
  The following event
  ~bv[]
  (defstobj ms
    (pcn  :type integer                  :initially 0)
    (mem  :type (array integer (100000)) :initially -1)
    (code :type t                        :initially nil))
  ~ev[]
  introduces a single-threaded object named ~c[ms] (which stands for
  ``machine state'').  The object has three fields, a ~c[pcn] or program
  counter, a ~c[mem] or memory, and a ~c[code] field.

  The ~c[mem] field is occupied by an object initially of type 
  ~c[(array integer (100000))].  Logically speaking, this is a list of
  length ~c[100000], each element of which is an integer.  But in the
  underlying implementation of the ~c[ms] object, this field is occupied
  by a raw Lisp array, initially of size 100000.~/

  You might expect the above ~c[defstobj] to define the accessor function
  ~c[mem] and the updater ~c[update-mem].  ~em[That does not happen!].

  The above event defines the accessor function ~c[memi] and the updater
  ~c[update-memi].  These functions do not access/update the ~c[mem] field of
  the ~c[ms] object; they access/update the individual elements of the
  array in that field.

  In particular, the logical definitions of the two functions are:
  ~bv[]
  (defun memi (i ms)
    (declare (xargs :guard
                    (and (msp ms)
                         (integerp i)
                         (<= 0 i)
                         (< i (mem-length ms)))))
    (nth i (nth 1 ms)))

  (defun update-memi (i v ms)
    (declare (xargs :guard
                    (and (msp ms)
                         (integerp i)
                         (<= 0 i)
                         (< i (mem-length ms))
                         (integerp v))))
    (update-nth-array 1 i v ms))
  ~ev[]

  For example, to access the 511th (0-based) memory location of the
  current ~c[ms] you could evaluate:
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>(memi 511 ms)
  -1
  ~ev[]
  The answer is ~c[-1] initially, because that is the above-specified
  initial value of the elements of the ~c[mem] array.

  To set that element you could do
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>(update-memi 511 777 ms)
  <ms>
  ACL2 !>(memi 511 ms)
  777
  ~ev[]

  The raw Lisp implementing these two functions is shown below.
  ~bv[]
  (defun memi (i ms)
    (declare (type (and fixnum (integer 0 *)) i))
    (the integer
         (aref (the (simple-array integer (*))
                    (svref ms 1))
               (the (and fixnum (integer 0 *)) i))))

  (defun update-memi (i v ms)
    (declare (type (and fixnum (integer 0 *)) i)
             (type integer v))
    (progn
     (setf (aref (the (simple-array integer (*))
                      (svref ms 1))
                 (the (and fixnum (integer 0 *)) i))
           (the integer v))
     ms))

  ~c[defstobj] and then evaluate the ACL2 form

  another example of a single-threaded object~/

  The event
  ~bv[]
  (defstobj $s
    (x :type integer :initially 0)
    (a :type (array (integer 0 9) (3)) :initially 9 :resizable t))
  ~ev[]
  introduces a stobj named ~c[$S].  The stobj has two fields, ~c[X] and
  ~c[A].  The ~c[A] field is an array.  The ~c[X] field contains an
  integer and is initially 0.  The ~c[A] field contains a list of
  integers, each between 0 and 9, inclusively.  (Under the hood, this
  ``list'' is actually implemented as an array.)  Initially, the ~c[A]
  field has three elements, each of which is 9.~/

  This event introduces the following sequence of function definitions:
  ~bv[]
  (DEFUN XP (X) ...)               ; recognizer for X field
  (DEFUN AP (X) ...)               ; recognizer of A field
  (DEFUN $SP ($S) ...)             ; top-level recognizer for stobj $S
  (DEFUN CREATE-$S NIL ...)        ; creator for stobj $S
  (DEFUN X ($S) ...)               ; accessor for X field
  (DEFUN UPDATE-X (V $S) ...)      ; updater for X field
  (DEFUN A-LENGTH ($S) ...)        ; length of A field
  (DEFUN RESIZE-A (K $S) ...)      ; resizer for A field
  (DEFUN AI (I $S) ...)            ; accessor for A field at index I
  (DEFUN UPDATE-AI (I V $S) ...)   ; updater for A field at index I
  ~ev[]

  Here is the definition of ~c[$SP]:
  ~bv[]
  (DEFUN $SP ($S)
    (DECLARE (XARGS :GUARD T :VERIFY-GUARDS T))
    (AND (TRUE-LISTP $S)
         (= (LENGTH $S) 2)
         (XP (NTH 0 $S))
         (AP (NTH 1 $S))
         T))
  ~ev[]
  This reveals that in order to satisfy ~c[$SP] an object must be
  a true list of length 2 whose first element satisfies ~c[XP] and whose
  second satisfies ~c[AP].  By printing the definition of ~c[AP] one
  learns that it requires its argument to be a true list, each element
  of which is an integer between 0 and 9.

  The initial value of stobj ~c[$S] is given by zero-ary ``creator''
  function ~c[CREATE-$S].  Creator functions may only be used in limited
  contexts.  ~l[with-local-stobj].

  Here is the definition of ~c[UPDATE-AI], the updater for the ~c[A] field
  at index ~c[I]:
  ~bv[]
  (DEFUN UPDATE-AI (I V $S)
    (DECLARE (XARGS :GUARD
                    (AND ($SP $S)
                         (INTEGERP I)
                         (<= 0 I)
                         (< I (A-LENGTH $S))
                         (AND (INTEGERP V) (<= 0 V) (<= V 9)))
                    :VERIFY-GUARDS T))
    (UPDATE-NTH-ARRAY 1 I V $S))
  ~ev[]
  By definition ~c[(UPDATE-NTH-ARRAY 1 I V $S)] is
  ~c[(UPDATE-NTH 1 (UPDATE-NTH I V (NTH 1 $S)) $S)].
  This may be a little surprising but should be perfectly clear.

  First, ignore the guard, since it is irrelevant in the logic.
  Reading from the inside out, ~c[(UPDATE-AI I V $S)] extracts ~c[(NTH 1 $S)],
  which is array ~c[a] of ~c[$S].  (Recall that ~ilc[NTH] is
  0-based.)  The next higher expression in the definition above,
  ~c[(UPDATE-NTH I V a)], ``modifies'' ~c[a] by setting its ~c[I]th
  element to ~c[V].  Call this ~c[a'].  The next higher expression,
  ~c[(UPDATE-NTH 1 a' $S)], ``modifies'' ~c[$S] by setting its 1st
  component to ~c[a'].  Call this result ~c[$s'].  Then ~c[$s'] is
  the result returned by ~c[UPDATE-AI].

  So the first useful observation is that from the perspective of the
  logic, the type ``restrictions'' on stobjs are irrelevant.  They
  are ``enforced'' by ACL2's guard mechanism, not by the definitions
  of the updater functions.

  As one might also imagine, the accessor functions do not really
  ``care,'' logically, whether they are applied to well-formed stobjs
  or not.  For example, ~c[(AI I $S)] is defined to be ~c[(NTH I (NTH 1 $S))].

  Thus, you will not be able to prove that (AI 2 $S) is an
  integer.  That is,
  ~bv[]
  (integerp (AI 2 $S))
  ~ev[]
  is not a theorem, because ~c[$S] may not be well-formed.

  Now ~c[(integerp (AI 2 $S))] will always evaluate to ~c[T] in the
  top-level ACL2 command loop, because we insist that the current value of
  the stobj ~c[$S] always satisfies ~c[$SP] by enforcing the guards on
  the updaters, independent of whether guard checking is on or off;
  ~pl[set-guard-checking].  But in a theorem ~c[$S] is just
  another variable, implicitly universally quantified.

  So ~c[(integerp (AI 2 $S))] is not a theorem because it is not true when
  the variable ~c[$S] is instantiated with, say,
  ~bv[]
  '(1 (0 1 TWO))
  ~ev[]
  because, logically speaking, ~c[(AI 2 '(1 (0 1 TWO)))] evaluates to
  the symbol ~c[TWO].  That is,
  ~bv[]
  (equal (AI 2 '(1 (0 1 TWO))) 'TWO)
  ~ev[]
  is true.

  However,
  ~bv[]
  (implies (and ($SP $S) (< 2 (A-LENGTH $S))) (integerp (AI 2 $S)))
  ~ev[]
  is a theorem.  To prove it, you will have to prove a lemma about
  ~c[AP].  The following will do:
  ~bv[]
  (defthm ap-nth
    (implies (and (AP x)
                  (integerp i)
                  (<= 0 i)
                  (< i (len x)))
             (integerp (nth i x)))).
  ~ev[]

  Similarly, 
  ~bv[]
  (implies (and (integerp i)
                (<= 0 i)
                (< i (A-LENGTH $S))
                (integerp v)
                (<= 0 v)
                (<= v 9))
           ($SP (UPDATE-AI i v $S)))
  ~ev[]
  is not a theorem until you add the additional hypothesis ~c[($SP $S)].
  To prove the resulting theorem, you will need a lemma such as the
  following.
  ~bv[]
  (defthm ap-update-nth
    (implies (and (AP a)
                  (integerp v)
                  (<= 0 v)
                  (<= v 9)
                  (integerp i)
                  (<= 0 i)
                  (< i (len a)))
             (AP (update-nth i v a))))
  ~ev[]

  The moral here is that from the logical perspective, you must
  provide the hypotheses that, as a programmer, you think are
  implicit on the structure of your stobjs, and you must prove their
  invariance.  This is a good area for further support, perhaps in
  the form of a library of macros.

  ~em[Resizing Array Fields]

  Recall the specification of the array field, ~c[A] for the stobj ~c[$S]
  introduced above:
  ~bv[]
  (a :type (array (integer 0 9) (3)) :initially 9 :resizable t)
  ~ev[]
  Logically, this field is a list, initially of length 3.  Under the
  hood, this field is implemented using a Common Lisp array with 3
  elements.  In some applications, one may wish to lengthen an array
  field, or even (to reclaim space) to shrink an array field.  The
  ~ilc[defstobj] event provides functions to access the current length
  of an array field and to change the array field, with default names
  obtained by suffixing the field name with ``~c[LENGTH-]'' or prefixing
  it with ``~c[RESIZE-],'' respectively.  The following log shows the uses
  of these fields in the above example.
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>(A-LENGTH $S)
  3
  ACL2 !>(RESIZE-A 10 $S) ; change length of A to 10
  <$s>
  ACL2 !>(A-LENGTH $S)
  10
  ACL2 !>(AI 7 $S)        ; new elements get value from :initially
  9
  ACL2 !>(RESIZE-A 2 $S)  ; truncate A down to first 2 elements
  <$s>
  ACL2 !>(A-LENGTH $S)
  2
  ACL2 !>(AI 7 $S)        ; error:  access past array bound


  ACL2 Error in TOP-LEVEL:  The guard for the function symbol AI, which
  is (AND ($SP $S) (INTEGERP I) (<= 0 I) (< I (A-LENGTH $S))), is violated
  by the arguments in the call (AI 7 $S).

  ACL2 !>
  ~ev[]
  Here are the definitions of the relevant functions for the above
  example; also ~pl[resize-list].
  ~bv[]
  (DEFUN A-LENGTH ($S)
    (DECLARE (XARGS :GUARD ($SP $S) :VERIFY-GUARDS T))
    (LEN (NTH 1 $S)))

  (DEFUN RESIZE-A (K $S)
    (DECLARE (XARGS :GUARD ($SP $S) :VERIFY-GUARDS T))
    (UPDATE-NTH 1
                (RESIZE-LIST (NTH 1 $S) K 9)
                $S))
  ~ev[]

  It is important to note that the implementation of array resizing in
  ACL2 involves copying the entire array into a newly allocated space
  and thus can be quite costly if performed often.  This approach was
  chosen in order to make array access and update as efficient as
  possible, with the suspicion that for most applications, array
  access and update are considerably more frequent than resizing
  (especially if the programmer is aware of the relative costs
  beforehand).

  It should also be noted that computations of lengths of stobj array
  fields should be fast (constant-time) in all or most Common Lisp
  implementations.

  Finally, if ~c[:resizable t] is not supplied as shown above, then
  an attempt to resize the array will result in an error.  If you do
  not intend to resize the array, it is better to omit the ~c[:resizable]
  option (or to supply ~c[:resizable nil]), since then the length
  function will be defined to return a constant, namely the initial
  length, which can simplify guard proofs (compare with the definition
  of ~c[A-LENGTH] above).

  This completes the tour through the documentation of ~il[stobj]s.

  However, ACL2 expects you to use ~c[with-local-stobj], not its
  expansion.  More precisely, stobj creator functions are not allowed
  except (implicitly) via ~c[with-local-stobj] and in logic-only
  situations (like theorems and hints).  Moreover, neither
  ~c[with-local-stobj] nor its expansions are legal when typed directly at
  the top-level loop.  ~l[top-level] for a way to use ~c[with-local-stobj]
  in the top-level loop.~/
  ~bv[]
  General Forms:
  (with-local-stobj stobj-name mv-let-form)
  (with-local-stobj stobj-name mv-let-form creator-name)
  ~ev[]
  where ~c[stobj-name] is the name of a ~il[stobj], ~c[mv-let-form] is a call
  of ~ilc[mv-let], and if ~c[creator-name] is supplied then it should be the
  name of the creator function for ~c[stobj-name]; ~pl[defstobj].  For the
  example form above, its expansion would use ~c[creator-name], if supplied, in
  place of ~c[create-st].  Note that ~c[stobj-name] must not be ~ilc[state]
  (the ACL2 state), except in special situations probably of interest only to
  system developers; ~pl[with-local-state].

  ~c[With-local-stobj] can be useful when a stobj is used to memoize
  intermediate results during a computation, yet it is desired not to
  make the ~c[stobj] a formal parameter for the function and its
  callers.

  ACL2 can reason about these ``local stobjs,'' and in particular
  about stobj creator functions.  For technical reasons, ACL2 will not
  allow you to enable the ~c[:EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART] ~il[rune] of a stobj
  creator function.

  Finally, here is a small example concocted in order to illustrate that
  ~c[with-local-stobj] calls can be nested.

; Essay on Nested Stobjs

; After Version_6.1 we introduced a new capability: allowing fields of stobjs
; to themselves be stobjs or arrays of stobjs.  Initially we resisted this idea
; because of an aliasing problem, which we review now, as it is fundamental to
; understanding our implementation.

; Consider the following events.

;   (defstobj st fld)
;   (defstobj st2 (fld2 :type st))

; Now suppose we could evaluate the following code, to be run immediately after
; admitting the two defstobj events above.

;   (let* ((st (fld2 st2))
;          (st (update-fld 3 st)))
;     (mv st st2))

; A reasonable raw-Lisp implementation of nested stobjs, using destructive
; updates, could be expected to have the property that for the returned st and
; st2, st = (fld2 st2) and thus (fld (fld2 st2)) = (fld st) = 3.  However,
; under an applicative semantics, st2 has not changed and thus, logically, it
; follows that (fld (fld2 st2)) has its original value of nil, not 3.

; In summary, a change to st can cause a logically-inexplicable change to st2.
; But this problem can also happen in reverse: a change to st2 can cause a
; logically-inexplicable change to st.  Consider evaluation of the following
; code, to be run immediately after admitting the two defstobj events above.

;   (let ((st2 (let* ((st (fld2 st2))
;                     (st (update-fld 3 st)))
;                (update-fld2 st st2))))
;     (mv st st2))

; With destructive updates in raw Lisp, we expect that st = (fld2 st2) for the
; returned st and st2, and thus (fld st) = (fld (fld2 st2)) = 3.  But
; logically, the returned st is as initially created, and hence (fld st) =
; nil.

; One can imagine other kinds of aliasing problems; imagine putting a single
; stobj into two different slots of a parent stobj.

; Therefore, we carefully control access to stobj fields of stobjs by
; introducing a new construct, stobj-let.  Consider for example the following
; events.

; (defstobj st1 ...)
; (defstobj st2 ...)
; (defstobj st3 ...)
; (defstobj st+ 
;           (fld1 :type st1)
;           (fld2 :type st2)
;           (fld3 :type (array st3 (8))))

; If producer and consumer are functions, then we can write the following
; form.  Note that stobj-let takes four "arguments": bindings, producer
; variables, a producer form, and a consumer form.

;   (stobj-let
;    ((st1 (fld1 st+))
;     (st2 (fld2 st+))
;     (st3 (fld3i 4 st+)))
;    (x st1 y st3 ...) ; producer variables
;    (producer st1 st2 st3 ...)
;    (consumer st+ x y ...))

; Updater names need to be supplied if not the default.  Thus, the form above
; is equivalent to the following.

;   (stobj-let
;    ((st1 (fld1 st+) update-fld1)
;     (st2 (fld2 st+) update-fld2)
;     (st3 (fld3i 4 st+) update-fld3i))
;    (x st1 y st3 ...) ; producer variables
;    (producer st1 st2 st3 ...)
;    (consumer st+ x y ...))

; The form above expands as follows in the logic (or at least, essentially so).
; The point is that we avoid the aliasing problem: there is no direct access to
; the parent stobj when running the producer, which is updated to stay in sync
; with updates to the child stobjs; and there is no direct access to the child
; stobjs when running the consumer.  Note that since st2 is not among the
; producer variables, fld2 is not updated.

;   (let ((st1 (fld1 st+))
;         (st2 (fld2 st+))
;         (st3 (fld3i 4 st+)))
;     (declare (ignorable st1 st2 st3)) ; since user has no way to do this
;     (mv-let (x st1 y st3 ...) ; producer variables
;             (check-vars-not-free (st+)
;                                  (producer st1 st2 st3 ...))
;             (let* ((st+ (update-fld1 st1 st+))
;                    (st+ (update-fld3i 4 st3 st+)))
;               (check-vars-not-free (st1 st2 st3)
;                                    (consumer st+ x y ...)))))

; We consider next whether the use of check-vars-not-free truly prevents access
; to a stobj named in its variable list (first argument).  For example, if
; <form> is the stobj-let form displayed above, might we let-bind foo to st+
; above <form> and then reference foo in the producer?  Such aliasing is
; prevented (or had better be!) by our implementation; in general, we cannot
; have two variables bound to the same stobj, or there would be logical
; problems: changes to a stobj not explained logically (because they result
; from destructive changes to a "copy" of the stobj that is really EQ to the
; original stobj).  On first glance, one might wonder if support for congruent
; stobjs could present a problem, for example as follows.  Suppose that
; function h is the identity function that maps stobj st1 to itself, suppose
; that st2 is a stobj congruent to st1, and consider the form (let ((st2 (h
; st1))) <term>).  If such a form could be legal when translating for execution
; (which is the only way live stobjs can be introduced), then the aliasing
; problem discussed above could arise, because st2 is bound to st1 and <term>
; could mention both st1 and st2.  But our handling of congruent stobjs allows
; h to map st1 to st2 and also to map st2 to st2, but not to map st1 to st2.
; There are comments about aliasing in the definitions of translate11-let and
; translate11-mv-let.

; In the bindings, an index in an array access must be a symbol or a (possibly
; quoted) natural number -- after all, there would be a waste of computation
; otherwise, since we do updates at the end.  For each index that is a
; variable, it must not be among the producer variables, to prevent its capture
; in the generated updater call.

; Of course, we make other checks too: for example, all of the top-level
; let-bound stobj fields must be distinct stobj variables that suitably
; correspond to distinct field calls on the same concrete (not abstract) stobj.
; (If we want to relax that restriction, we need to think very carefully about
; capture issues.)

; In raw Lisp, the expansion avoids the expense of binding st+ to the updates,
; or even updating st+ at all, since the updates to its indicated stobj fields
; are all destructive.  IGNORE declarations take the place of those updates.
; And the update uses let* instead of let at the top level, since (at least in
; CCL) that adds efficiency.

;   (let* ((st1 (fld1 st+))
;          (st2 (fld2 st+))
;          (st3 (fld3i 4 st+)))
;     (declare (ignorable st1 st2 st3))
;     (mv-let (x st1 y st3 ...)
;             (producer st1 st2 st3 ...)
;             (declare (ignore st1 st3))
;             (consumer st+ x y ...)))

; Note that bound variables of a stobj-let form must be unique.  Thus, if the
; parent stobj has two fields of the same stobj type, then they cannot be bound
; by the same stobj-let form unless different variables are used.  This may be
; possible, since stobj-let permits congruent stobjs in the bindings.  For
; example, suppose that we started instead with these defstobj events.

; (defstobj st1 ...)
; (defstobj st2 ... :congruent-to st1)
; (defstobj st3 ...)
; (defstobj st+ 
;           (fld1 :type st1)
;           (fld2 :type st1)
;           (fld3 :type (array st3 (8))))

; Then we can write the same stobj-let form as before.  ACL2 will check that
; st2 is congruent to the type of fld2, which is st1.

; The discussion above assumes that there are at least two producer variables
; for a stobj-let.  However, one producer variable is permitted, which
; generates a LET in place of an MV-LET.  For example, consider the following.

;   (stobj-let
;    ((st1 (fld1 st+))
;     (st2 (fld2 st+))
;     (st3 (fld3i 4 st+)))
;    (st1) ; producer variable
;    (producer st1 st2 st3 ...)
;    (consumer st+ x y ...))

; Here is the translation in the logic.

;   (let ((st1 (fld1 st+))
;         (st2 (fld2 st+))
;         (st3 (fld3 st+)))
;     (declare (ignorable st1 st2 st3))
;     (let ((st1 (check-vars-not-free (st+)
;                                     (producer st1 st2 st3 ...))))
;       (let* ((st+ (update-fld1 st1 st+)))
;         (check-vars-not-free (st1 st2 st3)
;                              (consumer st+ x y ...)))))

; For simplicity, each binding (in the first argument of stobj-let) should be
; for a stobj field.

; We had the following concern about *1* code generated for updaters of stobjs
; with stobj fields.  Oneify-cltl-code generates a check for *1* updater calls,
; for whether a stobj argument is live.  But should we consider the possibility
; that one stobj argument is live and another stobj argument is not?
; Fortunately, that's not an issue: if one stobj argument is live, then we are
; running code, in which case translate11 ensures that all stobj arguments are
; live.

  ":Doc-Section stobj

  using ~il[stobj]s that contain stobjs~/

  For this topic we assume that you already understand the basics of
  single-threaded objects in ACL2.  ~l[stobj], and in particular,
  ~pl[defstobj].  The latter topic defers discussion of the ability to specify
  a stobj field that is itself a stobj or an array of stobjs.  That discussion
  is the subject of the present ~il[documentation] topic.

  Our presentation is in four sections.  First we augment the documentation for
  ~ilc[defstobj] by explaining how stobjs may be specified for fields in a new
  stobj definition.  Then we explain an aliasing problem, which accounts for a
  prohibition against making direct calls to accessors and updaters involving
  stobj fields of stobjs.  Next, we introduce an ACL2 primitive, ~c[stobj-let],
  which provides the only way to read and write stobj components of stobjs.
  The final section provides precise documentation for ~c[stobj-let].

  See also ACL2 community book ~c[demos/modeling/nested-stobj-toy-isa.lisp] for
  a worked example, which applies nested stobj structures to defining
  interpreters.  A variety of small additional examples may be found in ACL2
  community book ~c[misc/nested-stobj-tests.lisp].  For further discussion, you
  are welcome to read the ``Essay on Nested Stobjs'', a long comment in ACL2
  source file ~c[other-events.lisp].  However, this documentation topic is
  intended to be self-contained for those familiar with stobjs.

  SECTION: Extension of ~ilc[defstobj] to permit ~il[stobj]s within stobjs

  Recall that the ~c[:type] keyword of a ~ilc[defstobj] field descriptor can
  specify the type of the field as a type-spec (~pl[type-spec]).  For example,
  the following specifies an integer field and a field that is an array of
  bytes.
  ~bv[]
    (defstobj st
      (int-field :type integer :initially 0)
      (ar-field :type (array unsigned-byte (10)) :initially 0))
  ~ev[]
  But the ~c[:type] of a stobj field descriptor may instead be based on a
  stobj.  For example, the following sequence of three ~il[events] is legal.
  The first field descriptor of ~c[top], named ~c[sub1-field], illustrates one
  new kind of value for ~c[:type]: the name of a previously-introduced stobj,
  which here is ~c[sub1]. The second field descriptor of ~c[top], named
  ~c[sub2-ar-field], illustrates the other new kind of value for ~c[:type]: an
  array whose elements are specified by the name of a previously-introduced
  stobj, in this case, the stobj ~c[sub2].
  ~bv[]
    (defstobj sub1 fld1)
    (defstobj sub2 fld2)
    (defstobj top
      (sub1-field :type sub1)
      (sub2-ar-field :type (array sub2 (10))))
  ~ev[]
  The ~c[:initially] keyword is illegal for fields whose ~c[:type] is a stobj
  or an array of stobjs.  Each such initial value is provided by a
  corresponding call of the stobj creator for that stobj.  In particular, in
  the case of an array of stobjs, the stobj creator is called once for each
  element of the array, so that the array elements are distinct.  For example,
  each element of ~c[sub2-ar-field] in the example above is initially provided
  by a separate call of ~c[create-sub2].  Each initial element is thus unique,
  and in particular is distinct from the initial global value of the stobj.
  Similarly, the initial global stobj for ~c[sub1] is distinct from the initial
  ~c[sub1-field] field of the global stobj for ~c[top], as these result from
  separate calls of ~c[create-sub1].

  When a stobj is used in a field of another stobj, we may refer to the former
  field as a ``child stobj'' and the latter stobj as a ``parent stobj''.  So in
  the example above, ~c[sub1-field] is a child stobj of type ~c[sub1] for
  parent stobj ~c[top], and ~c[sub2-ar-field] is an array of child stobjs of
  type ~c[sub2] for parent stobj ~c[top].  A child stobj has the same
  structural shape as the global stobj of its type, but as explained above,
  these are distinct structures.  We follow standard terminology by saying
  ``isomorphic'' to indicate the same structural shape.  So for example, (the
  value of) ~c[sub1-field] is isomorphic to ~c[sub1], though these are distinct
  structures.

  SECTION: An aliasing problem

  Before introducing ~c[stobj-let] below, we provide motivatation for this
  ACL2 primitive.

  Consider the following ~il[events].
  ~bv[]
    (defstobj child fld)
    (defstobj parent
      (fld2 :type child))
  ~ev[]
  Now suppose we could evaluate the following code, to be run immediately after
  admitting the two ~ilc[defstobj] events above.
  ~bv[]
    (let* ((child (fld2 parent))
           (child (update-fld 3 child)))
      (mv child parent))
  ~ev[]
  Now logically there is no change to ~c[parent]: ~c[parent] is passed through
  unchanged.  We can indeed prove that fact!
  ~bv[]
    (thm (equal (mv-nth 1
                        (let* ((child (fld2 parent))
                               (child (update-fld 3 child)))
                          (mv child parent)))
                parent))
  ~ev[]
  But recall that stobjs are updated with destructive assignments.  That is, we
  really are updating ~c[(fld2 parent)] to be the new value of ~c[child],
  whether this is explained logically or not.  Thus, evaluation of the above
  ~ilc[let*] form does in fact change the actual global stobj, ~c[parent].

  (Aside: Here is an explanation involving raw Lisp, for those who might find
  this useful.  We escape to raw Lisp and execute the following; note that
  ~c[*the-live-parent*] is the Lisp variable representing the global value of
  ~c[parent].
  ~bv[]
  (let ((parent *the-live-parent*))
    (let* ((child (fld2 parent))
           (child (update-fld 4 child)))
      (mv child parent)))
  ~ev[]
  Then, in raw Lisp, ~c[(fld (fld2 *the-live-parent*))] evaluates to ~c[4],
  illustrating the destructive update.  End of Aside.)

  Such aliasing can permit a change to a child stobj to cause a
  logically-inexplicable change to the parent stobj.  Similarly, unfettered
  accessing of stobj fields can result in logically inexplicable changes to the
  child stobj when the parent stobj is changed.  Thus, ACL2 disallows direct
  calls of stobj accessors and updaters for fields whose ~c[:type] is a stobj
  or an array of stobjs.  Instead, ACL2 provides ~c[stobj-let] for reading and
  writing such fields in a sound manner.

  SECTION: Accessing and updating stobj fields of stobjs using ~c[stobj-let]

  ACL2 provides a primitive, ~c[stobj-let], to access and update stobj fields
  of stobjs, in a manner that avoids the aliasing problem discussed above.  In
  this section we provide an informal introduction to ~c[stobj-let], using
  examples, to be followed in the next section by precise documentation.

  We begin by returning to a slight variant of the example above.
  ~bv[]
    (defstobj child fld)
    (defstobj parent 
      (fld2 :type child)
      fld3)
  ~ev[]
  The following form returns the result of updating the ~c[fld2] field of
  ~c[parent], which is a stobj isomorphic to ~c[child], to have a value of 3.
  Below we explain the terms ``bindings'', ``producer variables'',
  ``producer'', and ``consumer'', as well as how to understand the form above.
  ~bv[]
    (stobj-let
     ((child (fld2 parent)))  ; bindings
     (child)                  ; producer variable(s)
     (update-fld 3 child)     ; producer
     (update-fld3 'a parent)) ; consumer
  ~ev[]
  The four lines under ``~c[stobj-let]'' just above can be understood,
  respectively, as follows.
  ~bf[]
  o Bindings:
      Bind ~c[child] to ~c[(fld2 parent)].
  o Producer variable(s) and producer:
      Bind the producer variable, ~c[child], to
      the value of the producer, ~c[(update-fld 3 child)].
  o Implicit extra step:
      Update ~c[fld2] of ~c[parent] with the producer variable, ~c[child].
  o Consumer:
      Finally, return ~c[(update-fld3 'a parent)].
  ~ef[]
  Thus, the logical expansion of the ~c[stobj-let] form above is the following
  expression, though this is approximate (see below).
  ~bv[]
    (let ((child (fld2 parent))) ; bindings
      (let ((child (update-fld 3 child))) ; bind producer vars to producer
        (let ((parent (update-fld2 child parent))) ; update parent
          (update-fld3 'a parent))))
  ~ev[]
  The bindings always bind distinct names to child stobjs of a unique parent
  stobj, where the child stobj corresponds to the ~c[:type] associated with the
  indicated accessor in the ~ilc[defstobj] form for the parent stobj.  Thus in
  this case, for the unique binding, variable ~c[child] is bound to the stobj
  of `type' ~c[child] for accessor ~c[fld2] of the parent stobj, ~c[parent].
  We refer to ~c[child] from the bindings as a ``stobj-let-bound variable''.
  Note also that the ``implicit extra step'' mentioned above is generated by
  macroexpansion of ~c[stobj-let]; it logically updates the parent with new
  child values, just before calling the consumer.  Implementation note:
  Destructive updating in raw Lisp lets us omit this implicit extra step.

  The form above is equivalent to the form displayed just below, which differs
  only in specifying an explicit stobj updater corresponding to the stobj
  accessor, ~c[fld2].  Here we show the default updater name, whose name has
  ~c[\"UPDATE-\"] prepended to the name of the accessor.  But if the
  ~c[:RENAMING] field of the ~c[defstobj] event specified a different updater
  name corresponding to ~c[fld2], then that would need to be included where we
  have added ~c[update-fld2] below.
  ~bv[]
    (stobj-let
     ((child (fld2 parent) update-fld2)) ; bindings, including updater(s)
     (child)                  ; producer variables
     (update-fld 3 child)     ; producer
     (update-fld3 'a parent)) ; consumer
  ~ev[]

  If you try to evaluate (either version of) the above ~c[stobj-let] form in
  the top-level loop, you will get an error.  For technical reasons, ACL2
  limits ~c[stobj-let] computation on ``live'' stobjs (as opposed to list
  structures that happen to satisfy stobj recognizers) to be within function
  bodies.  The following edited log illustrates how ~c[stobj-let] may be used
  in function bodies.
  ~bv[]

              (child)                   ; producer variables

             (stobj-let
              ((child (fld2 parent))) ; bindings
              (val)                   ; producer variables
              (fld child)             ; producer
              val))                   ; consumer
    [[output omitted]]
     CHECK-F
    ACL2 !>(check-f parent)

    ACL2 !>
  ~ev[]

  Notice that the second function defined above, ~c[check-f], uses a
  ~c[stobj-let] form that returns an ordinary value: it reads a value from a
  child stobj, but does not write to the child stobj, as indicated by the lack
  of a child stobj among the producer variables.  So for that ~c[stobj-let]
  form, there is no implicit extra step.

  For the ~c[stobj-let] expansion displayed earlier above, we said it was
  ``approximate'' for two reasons, which we give here informally.  (You can
  apply ~c[:]~ilc[trans1] to the ~c[stobj-let] call above to see the formal
  expansion.)  First, ~c[stobj-let] declares the stobj-let-bound variables to
  be ~c[ignorable] for the top ~c[let] bindings.  Second, and more importantly,
  ~c[stobj-let] imposes the following restrictions on the producer and
  consumer, to avoid the aliasing problem: it disallows references to the
  parent stobj in the producer and it also disallows references to any bound
  stobj (i.e., bound in the bindings) in the consumer.

  We conclude this section with examples based on a slight variation of the
  nested stobj example from the first section above.  These events can also be
  found in ACL2 community book ~c[misc/nested-stobj-tests.lisp], immediately
  under the following comment:
  ~bv[]
  ; As promised in :doc stobj-let, we begin with an example from that :doc.
  ~ev[]
  Note that some lemmas were needed in order to complete the ~il[guard] proof
  for the function ~c[update-top], which may be found in the above file; they
  are omitted below.

  First we introduce three stobjs.
  ~bv[]
    (defstobj kid1 fld1)
    (defstobj kid2 fld2)
    (defstobj mom
      (kid1-field :type kid1)
      (kid2-ar-field :type (array kid2 (5)))
      last-op)
  ~ev[]
  The next function takes a given index and a ~c[mom] stobj, and swaps the
  value stored in the stobj in ~c[mom]'s ~c[kid2-ar-field] array at that index
  with the value stored in the stobj in ~c[mom]'s ~c[kid1-field] field.
  ~bv[]
    (defun mom-swap-fields (index mom)
      (declare (xargs :stobjs mom
                      :guard (and (natp index)
                                  (< index (kid2-ar-field-length mom)))))
      (stobj-let
       ((kid1 (kid1-field mom))
        (kid2 (kid2-ar-fieldi index mom)))
       (kid1 kid2)
       (let* ((val1 (fld1 kid1))
              (val2 (fld2 kid2))
              (kid1 (update-fld1 val2 kid1))
              (kid2 (update-fld2 val1 kid2)))
         (mv kid1 kid2))
       (update-last-op 'swap mom)))
  ~ev[]
  Function ~c[mom.kid1-fld1] stores a given value in the given ~c[mom]'s
  ~c[kid1-fld1] field.
  ~bv[]
    (defun mom.kid1-fld1 (val mom)
      (declare (xargs :stobjs mom))
      (stobj-let
       ((kid1 (kid1-field mom)))
       (kid1)
       (update-fld1 val kid1)
       (update-last-op val mom)))
  ~ev[]
  We next combine the two functions above, according to an ~c[op] argument, as

  Notice that above, we never tried to access two different entries of the
  array.  This can be done, but we need to bind two different stobjs to those
  fields.  Fortunately, congruent stobjs make this possible; ~pl[defstobj], in
  particular the discussion of congruent stobjs.  Since we want to bind two
  stobjs to values in the array that are isomorphic to the stobj ~c[kid2], we
  introduce a stobj congruent to ~c[kid2].
  ~bv[]
    (defstobj kid2a fld2a :congruent-to kid2)
  ~ev[]
  Then we can define our swapping function as follows.  The ~il[guard] proof
  obligation includes the requirement that the two indices be distinct, again
  to avoid an aliasing problem.

                                  (not (equal i1 i2)))))

  SECTION: Precise documentation for ~c[stobj-let]

  ~bv[]
  General Form:
  (stobj-let
   BINDINGS
   PRODUCER-VARIABLES
   PRODUCER
   CONSUMER)
  ~ev[]
  where ~c[PRODUCER-VARIABLES] is a non-empty true list of legal variable names
  without duplicates, ~c[PRODUCER] and ~c[CONSUMER] are expressions, and
  ~c[BINDINGS] is a list subject to the following requirements.

  ~c[BINDINGS] is a non-empty true list of tuples, each of which has the form
  ~c[(VAR ACCESSOR)] or ~c[(VAR ACCESSOR UPDATER)].  There is a stobj name,
  ~c[ST], previously introduced by ~ilc[defstobj] (not ~ilc[defabsstobj]), such
  that each ~c[accessor] is of the form ~c[(ACC ST)] or ~c[(ACCi I ST)], with
  the same stobj name (~c[ST]) for each binding.  In the case ~c[(ACC ST)],
  ~c[ACC] is the accessor for a non-array field of ~c[ST].  In the case
  ~c[(ACCi I ST)], ~c[ACCi] is the accessor for an array field of ~c[ST], and
  ~c[I] is either a variable, a natural number, a list ~c[(quote N)] where
  ~c[N] is a natural number, or a symbol introduced by ~ilc[defconst].  If
  ~c[UPDATER] is supplied, then it is a symbol that is the name of the stobj
  updater for the field of ~c[ST] accessed by ~c[ACCESSOR].  If ~c[UPDATER] is
  not supplied, then for the discussion below we consider it to be, implicitly,
  the symbol in the same package as the function symbol of ~c[ACCESSOR] (i.e.,
  ~c[ACC] or ~c[ACCi]), obtained by prepending the string ~c[\"UPDATE-\"] to
  the ~ilc[symbol-name] of that function symbol.  Finally, ~c[ACCESSOR] has a
  ~il[signature] specifying a return value that is either ~c[ST] or is stobj
  that is congruent to ~c[ST].

  If the conditions above are met, then the General Form expands to the one of
  the following expressions, depending on whether the list
  ~c[PRODUCER-VARIABLES] has one member or more than one member, respectively.
  (But see below for extra code that may be inserted if there are stobj array
  accesses in ~c[BINDINGS].)  Here we write ~c[STOBJ-LET-BOUND-VARS] for the
  list of variables ~c[VAR] discussed above, i.e., for
  ~c[(strip-cars BINDINGS)].  And, we write ~c[UPDATES] for the result of
  mapping through ~c[PRODUCER-VARIABLES] and, for each variable ~c[VAR] that
  has a binding ~c[(VAR ACCESSOR UPDATER)] in ~c[BINDINGS] (where ~c[UPDATER]
  may be implicit, as discussed above), collect into ~c[UPDATES] the tuple
  ~c[(ST (UPDATER VAR ST))].

  For ~c[PRODUCER-VARIABLES] = ~c[(PRODUCER-VAR)]:
  ~bv[]
    (let BINDINGS
      (declare (ignorable . STOBJ-LET-BOUND-VARIABLES))
      (let ((PRODUCER-VAR PRODUCER))
        (let* UPDATES
          CONSUMER)))
  ~ev[]

  Otherwise:
  ~bv[]
    (let BINDINGS
      (declare (ignorable . STOBJ-LET-BOUND-VARIABLES))
      (mv-let PRODUCER-VARS
              PRODUCER
              (let* UPDATES
                CONSUMER)))
  ~ev[]
  Moreover, ACL2 places restrictions on the resulting expression: ~c[ST] must
  not occur free in ~c[PRODUCER], and every variable in
  ~c[STOBJ-LET-BOUND-VARIABLES] must not occur free in ~c[CONSUMER].

  ~c[Stobj-let] forms can be evaluated using ordinary objects in theorem
  contexts, much as any form.  They can also, of course, appear in function
  bodis.  However, a ~c[stobj-let] form cannot be evaluated directly in the
  top-level loop or other top-level contexts for execution (such as during
  ~ilc[make-event] expansion).

  Finally, let ~c[FORM] denote the form displayed above (either case).  We
  explain how ~c[FORM] is actually replaced by an expression of the form
  ~c[(PROGN$ ... FORM)].  This expression generates an extra ~il[guard] proof
  obligation, which guarantees that no aliasing occurs from binding two
  stobj-let-bound variables to the same array access.  So fix a stobj array
  accessor ~c[ACCi] for which some stobj is bound to ~c[(ACCi I ST)] in
  ~c[BINDINGS]; we define an expression ~c[ACCi-CHECK] as follows.  Collect up
  all such index expressions ~c[I], where if ~c[I] is of the form ~c[(quote N)]
  then replace ~c[I] by ~c[N].  If the resulting list of index expressions for
  ~c[ACCi] consists solely of distinct numbers, or if it is of length 1, then
  no extra check is generated for ~c[ACCi].  Otherwise, let ~c[ACCi-CHECK] be
  the form ~c[(chk-no-duplicatesp (list I1 ... Ik))], where ~c[I1], ..., ~c[Ik]
  are the index expressions for ~c[ACCi].  Note: ~c[chk-no-duplicatesp] is a
  function that returns nil, but has a ~il[guard] that its argument is an
  ~ilc[eqlable-listp] that satisfies ~ilc[no-duplicatesp].  Finally, ~c[FORM]
  is replaced by ~c[(PROGN$ CHK1 ... CHKn FORM)], where the ~c[CHKm] range over
  all of the above ~c[ACCi-CHECK].~/~/"

  tracing functions in ACL2~/

  ACL2 provides a trace utility, ~ilc[trace$], with corresponding reverse
  operation ~ilc[untrace$].  These can be used without any dependence on the
  underlying Lisp utility, and are the tracing utilities of choice in ACL2;
  ~pl[trace$] and ~pl[untrace$].

  However, for advanced users we note that the underlying host Lisp may also
  provide a trace utility, ~c[trace], and corresponding ~c[untrace].  Moreover,
  these have been modified in the case that the host Lisp is GCL, Allegro CL,
  or CCL (OpenMCL), to provide limited support for ~c[:entry], ~c[:exit], and
  perhaps ~c[:cond] keywords, to hide certain large data structures (world,
  enabled structure, rewrite constant), and to trace executable counterparts.
  See source files ~c[*-trace.lisp].  For the above Lisps, you can invoke the
  original ~c[trace] and ~c[untrace] by invoking ~c[old-trace] and
  ~c[old-untrace], respectively, in raw Lisp rather than in the normal ACL2
  loop.~/~/

  set the trace evisc tuple~/

  A trace evisc-tuple, which is set by this utility, provides a means to
  restrict printing during tracing.  ~l[evisc-tuple] for an introduction to
  evisc-tuples; also ~pl[set-evisc-tuple] and ~pl[set-iprint].

  By default the ACL2 ~il[trace] mechanism, ~ilc[trace$], automatically deals
  with stobjs, the logical world, and certain other large structures.
  ~l[trace$], in particular the documentation of ~c[trace$] option ~c[:hide].
  However, even with that default behavior you may want to restrict what is
  printed according to the print-level and print-length of an evisc-tuple;
  ~pl[evisc-tuple].

  ~bv[]
  Examples:

  ; Set trace evisc tuple to a standard value, using current Lisp *print-level*
  ; and *print-length* variables:
  (set-trace-evisc-tuple t state)

  ; Set trace evisc tuple back to its default:
  (set-trace-evisc-tuple nil state)

  ; Set trace evisc tuple to restrict print-level to 3 and print-length to 4,
  ; while hiding the logical world and suitably printing stobjs even if trace$
  ; option ``:hide nil'' is used.  (Note: calling ~c[trace-evisceration-alist]
  ; directly requires removing this function as `untouchable', which requires a
  ; trust tag; ~pl[remove-untouchable].)
  (set-trace-evisc-tuple
   (evisc-tuple 3 4 (trace-evisceration-alist state) nil)
   state)~/

  General Forms:

  (set-trace-evisc-tuple nil state) ; trace evisc-tuple set to standard value
  (set-trace-evisc-tuple   t state) ; trace evisc-tuple set to hide the logical
                                    ;   world and deal with stobjs even when
                                    ;   trace$ option ``:hide nil'' is supplied
  (set-trace-evisc-tuple evisc-tuple state)
                                    ; tracing set to use indicated evisc-tuple
  ~ev[]

  ~l[trace$] for a discussion of ACL2 tracing.  The ~il[evisc-tuple] used by
  that trace utility is the one last installed by ~c[set-trace-evisc-tuple]
  (or by ~ilc[set-evisc-tuple] for the trace-evisc-tuple) ~-[] initially to the
  default of ~c[nil] ~-[] unless overriden by trace option ~c[:evisc-tuple].

  ~st[Remark].  If you use value ~c[t], then ACL2 will ensure that the logical
  world and stobjs are kept up-to-date in the trace evisc-tuple."

  where the ~c[speci] are trace specs, as described below.

  ~c[Trace$] installs alternate code for the indicated functions that prints
  information upon entry to, and exit from, calls of the functions.  For an
  alternate tracing utility used for educational purposes in ACL2s
  (~url[http://acl2s.ccs.neu.edu/acl2s/doc/]), see community book
  ~c[books/misc/trace-star.lisp].

  From a logical perspective all trace printing is a fiction.  (But ~pl[trace!]
  for a way to get around this and modify ~il[state].)  For a related fiction,
  ~pl[cw].  ~c[(Trace$)] returns the list of currently-active trace specs,
  while the application of ~c[trace$] to at least one argument returns the list
  of its arguments that are successfully acted on.

  Output from ~ilc[trace$] normally goes to the screen, i.e., to
  ~ilc[standard-co].  But it can be redirected to a file;
  ~pl[open-trace-file].

  ~l[untrace$] for how to undo the effect of ~ilc[trace$].  Also ~pl[trace] for
  mention of modifications made to raw Lisp trace, which is accessible (as
  described below) using the ~c[:native] keyword.

  Note that when ~c[trace$] is applied to a function without option
  ~c[:native], that function's declarations and documentation are discarded.~/

  Next, we introduce tracing with some examples.  After that, we provide
  reference documentation for individual trace options allowed in a trace spec.
  Note that although our example focuses on user-defined functions, ~c[trace$]
  can also be applied to built-in functions, though perhaps only system hackers
  should take advantage of this observation.

  We begin by illustrating the simplest sort of trace spec: a function symbol.
  For example, the form ~c[(trace$ foo bar)] directs the tracing of functions
  ~c[foo] and ~c[bar] by virtue of the two trace specs ~c[foo] and ~c[bar].  We
  can see tracing in action by first defining:
  ~bv[]
  (defun f (x)
    (cons x x))

  (defun g (x)
    (list (f x) 3))
  ~ev[]

  The following log then illustrates tracing of these two functions.  Notice
  that before ~il[guard]s have been verified, the so-called ``*1*'' functions
  (sometimes called ``executable counterpart functions'' or ``logic
  functions'') are called but the corresponding raw Lisp functions are not; but
  after guard verification of ~c[f], the raw Lisp counterpart of ~c[f] is
  indeed called.  (~l[guard] and ~pl[guard-evaluation-examples-log].)

  ~ev[]

  We now document all of the options that may appear in a trace spec.  A trace
  spec with options is of the form
  ~bv[]
  (fn :kwd1 val1 :kwd2 val2 ... :kwdn valn)
  ~ev[]
  and here we document each legal keyword ~c[:kwdi] and corresponding expected
  value ~c[vali].  Note that ~c[trace$] is intended primarily for functions
  defined in the ACL2 command loop (~pl[lp]).  If you want to trace a function
  that defined in raw Lisp, then you can use option ~c[:native] (see below),
  but then many other ~c[trace$] options will not be available to you: all of
  them except ~c[:multiplicity] and ~c[:native] itself will be passed directly
  to the ~c[trace] utility of the underlying Common Lisp.

  ~c[:COND], ~c[:ENTRY], and ~c[:EXIT]

  ~st[Introduction].  For each of these three options, the value is a
  (user-level) term, except that for ~c[:entry] and ~c[:exit] the value can be
  of the form ~c[(:fmt u)] or ~c[(:fmt! u)], where ~c[u] is a user-level term.
  We skip these two latter cases for now and return to them later.  Then the
  indicated term is evaluated as indicated in the next paragraph, and if the
  ~c[:cond] term is omitted or evaluates to non-~c[nil], then the value of the
  ~c[:entry] term is printed on entry and the value of the ~c[:exit] term is
  printed on exit.  By default, where ~c[:entry] is omitted or is specified as
  ~c[nil], the value printed for ~c[:entry] is the list obtained by consing the
  calling function symbol onto the list of actual parameters: in the notation
  described below, this is ~c[(cons TRACED-FN ARGLIST)].  Similarly, the
  default for printing at the exit of the function call, i.e. where ~c[:exit]
  is omitted or is specified as ~c[nil], is ~c[(cons TRACED-FN VALUES)] where
  ~c[VALUES] is the list of values returned as described below.

  In the evaluations of the term described below upon a call of ~c[fn], each
  formal parameter of the definition of ~c[fn] will be bound to the
  corresponding actual of the call, the variable ~c[ARGLIST] will be bound to
  the list of actuals, and the variable ~c[TRACED-FN] will be bound to the
  function being called (either ~c[fn] or its executable counterpart function;
  see above).  Additionally in the case of ~c[:exit], the variable ~c[VALUES]
  will be bound to the multiple values returned (thus, a one-element list if
  ~ilc[mv] is not used in the return).  Also for ~c[:exit], we bind ~c[VALUE]
  to the logical value returned, i.e., to the suitable list of values returned
  in the ~ilc[mv] case and otherwise to the single value returned.  So in the
  ~c[mv] case, ~c[VALUE] is the same as ~c[VALUES], and otherwise ~c[VALUE] is
  ~c[(car VALUES)].  Other than these variables and ~ilc[STATE], no other
  variable may occur in the term, whose value must be a single non-~ilc[stobj]
  value, unless there is an active trust tag (~pl[defttag]).

  Now suppose ~c[fn] is called.  First: If ~c[:cond] is supplied and the result
  of evaluating the ~c[:cond] term is ~c[nil], then no tracing is done.
  Otherwise tracing proceeds as follows.  First the ~c[:entry] form is
  evaluated, and the result is printed.  Then the call of ~c[fn] is evaluated.
  Finally the ~c[:exit] term is evaluated and the result is printed.  As
  indicated above, the default for the ~c[:entry] term if omitted or explicitly
  ~c[nil] is ~c[(cons TRACED-FN ARGLIST)], and the default for the ~c[:exit]
  term if omitted or explicitly ~c[nil] is ~c[(cons TRACED-FN VALUES)].

  Note that if the function has a formal named ~c[ARGLIST], then ~c[ARGLIST]
  will nevertheless refer to the entire list of formals, not the single formal
  named ~c[ARGLIST]; similarly for ~c[TRACED-FN], and additionally for
  ~c[VALUE] and ~c[VALUES] in the case of ~c[:exit].

  As mentioned above, for each of ~c[:entry] and ~c[:exit], a value of ~c[nil]
  specifies the default behavior.  If you really want a value of ~c[nil], use a
  non-~c[nil] form that evaluates to ~c[nil], for example ~c[(car nil)] or
  ~c['nil].  However, for ~c[:cond] a value of ~c[nil] means what it says: do
  not evaluate the ~c[:entry] or ~c[:exit] forms.

  Finally we discuss the case that the ~c[:entry] or ~c[:exit] term is of the
  form ~c[(:fmt u)] or ~c[(:fmt! u)].  In these cases, the term ~c[u] is
  evaluated as described above to produce a value, say ~c[msg], but instead of
  printing ~c[msg] directly, ACL2 calls ~c[fmt1] using the string ~c[\"~~@0\"]
  and the alist that binds just character ~c[#\\0] to ~c[msg].  The following
  example illustrates this point, where ~c[fact] is defined as above.  Also
  ~pl[fmt].  Note that ~c[(msg string . vals)] produces a value suitable for a
  ~c[\"~~@\"] directive to the ~c[fmt] family of print functions.

  ~st[ADVANCED OPTIONS] (alphabetical list)

  ~c[:COMPILE]

  The tracing of ~c[fn] installs a substitute definition of ~c[fn] that prints
  trace information.  If the ~c[:compile] option is omitted or has value
  ~c[:same], then the new definition will be compiled if and only if the
  existing definition is already compiled.  Otherwise, the new definition will
  be compiled exactly when the value of ~c[:compile] is not ~c[nil].

  ~c[:DEF], ~c[:MULTIPLICITY]

  ACL2's ~c[trace$] mechanism often needs to know the number of outputs of a
  traced function, in the sense of ~ilc[mv].  If you trace a function that was
  not defined inside the ACL2 loop (hence you are using the ~c[:native]
  option), or if you provide an alternative definition using option ~c[:def]
  (see below) and the new definition changes the number of values returned,
  then a natural number value for ~c[:multiplicity] informs the trace utility
  of the number of expected outputs of the function being traced.  In the case
  that ~c[:native] is supplied, the effect of a non-~c[nil] ~c[:multiplicity]
  value depends on the host Lisp.  In the case of Lisps for which ACL2 uses the
  built-in Lisp mechanism for returning multiple values (~pl[mv]), which are
  CCL and threaded SBCL as of June, 2010, ~c[:multiplicity] is not needed and
  is ignored with ~c[:native t].  For GCL and Allegro CL, ~c[:multiplicity] is
  used to generate a suitable ~c[:exit] form if the ~c[:exit] keyword was not
  already supplied.  For the other Lisps, the ~c[:multiplicity] value is
  treated essentially as 1 whether it is supplied or not, because we do not
  know how to pass suitable information based on this value to the host Lisp's
  built-in tracing mechanism.

  Note that even supplying a ~c[:multiplicity] option does not change the
  meaning of the variable ~c[values].  See the discussion of ~c[:native]
  below.

  A useful option can be to supply a definition as the value of ~c[:def].
  (Again, note that if ~c[:native] is used, then all options other than
  ~c[:multiplicity] are passed directly to the underlying Lisp; in particular,
  ~c[:def] will have no effect with ~c[:native] except in the unlikely case
  that the raw Lisp provides some sort of support for ~c[:def].)  Note that
  this definition should be like a ~ilc[defun] form, but without the leading
  ~c[defun] symbol; and it should define the function symbol being traced, with
  the same formal parameter list.  However, tracing of the so-called
  ``executable counterpart'' of a function (sometimes referred to as the ``*1*
  function'', for evaluation in the ACL2 loop; ~pl[guards] for related
  discussion) is not sensitive to the ~c[:def] option; rather, if a function
  has an executable counterpart then that executable counterpart is traced.

  ~c[:EVISC-TUPLE]

  The printing described above is, by default, done using the current default
  trace evisc-tuple, which can be set using ~ilc[set-trace-evisc-tuple] (for
  the shape of this tuple, ~pl[evisc-tuple]); ~pl[set-trace-evisc-tuple].
  This tuple is based by default on the raw Lisp variables ~c[*print-level*]
  and ~c[*print-length*], and will hide the ACL2 ~c[world] and handle
  ~il[stobj]s appropriately.  You may override this default by supplying an
  evisc tuple with the ~c[:evisc-tuple] argument in your trace spec.  Be
  careful to supply a valid evisc-tuple, or you may get a raw Lisp error!

  A special value, ~c[:print], is useful if you are doing system hacking that
  can produce objects that are not valid ACL2 objects, such as raw Lisp arrays
  or objects in supporting packages not visible in the ACL2 read-eval-print
  loop.  If you supply ~c[:evisc-tuple :print], then the printing described
  above will be done with raw Lisp printing rather than ACL2 printing:
  specifically, with ~c[(format *trace-output* \"~s~%\" x)], where ~c[x] is the
  value to be printed.

  A second special value for ~c[:evisc-tuple], ~c[:no-print], avoids printing
  the values of the ~c[:entry] and ~c[:exit] forms (or their defaults, if not
  specified).  This option is of use for side effects; for an example see
  community book ~c[books/misc/wet.lisp].

  Note that if ~c[:evisc-tuple X] is supplied, then the form ~c[X] will be
  evaluated before the function body is entered.  You can thus pull some tricks
  to print extra information before the ~c[:entry] form is evaluated, for
  example as follows for a factorial function, ~c[fact].

  ~ev[]

  ~c[:FORMALS]

  Normally ACL2 can figure out the formals for a given function.  This is
  always the case for functions defined in the ACL2 command loop and when
  option ~c[:def] is supplied.  If neither of these cases applies then you can
  still trace a function (even without using the ~c[:native] option) by
  supplying option ~c[:notinline :fncall], but you will still need to supply
  the list of formal parameters.  The value of the ~c[:formals] option should
  be the list of formals in this case.

  ~c[:HIDE]

  The default value for this advanced option is ~c[t], which causes ~il[stobj]s
  and the logical ~il[world] to be printed as single symbols, along with
  certain large structures of interest to developers (rewrite contants, enabled
  structures, and event and command index structures).  If however the value
  ~c[nil] is supplied, then this default behavior is defeated.  In that case,
  you can still arrange to print the logical world as a symbol and to print
  ~il[stobj]s without breaking the trace printing: ~pl[set-trace-evisc-tuple]
  for how to do this globally, or similarly use the ~c[:evisc-tuple] option to
  ~c[trace$] to do this with a single trace spec.  Note however that with value
  ~c[nil] specified for ~c[:hide], such use of an evisc-tuple will not deal
  properly with local stobjs (~pl[with-local-stobj]) or stobjs bound by
  ~ilc[stobj-let], or with the aforementioned large structures other than the
  logical ~il[world].

  ~c[:NATIVE]

  If ~c[:native] is supplied with a non-~c[nil] value, then the trace spec is
  passed to the native Lisp trace (after removing the ~c[:native] option).  A
  trust tag (~pl[defttag]) is required in order to use this option, because no
  syntactic check is made on the ~c[:cond], ~c[:entry], or ~c[:exit] forms --
  arbitrary raw Lisp may occur in them!

  Note that by ``native Lisp trace'' we mean the currently installed ~c[trace].
  As discussed briefly elsewhere (~pl[trace]), ACL2 has modified that trace to
  be more useful if the underlying host Lisp is GCL, Allegro CL, or CCL
  (OpenMCL).  If you need the original trace utility supplied for those Lisps,
  quit the ACL2 loop with ~c[:q] and call ~c[old-trace] and ~c[old-untrace] in
  raw Lisp where you would otherwise call ~c[trace] and ~c[untrace].  Note that
  the original trace utility supplied with a given Lisp will not hide the ACL2
  logical ~il[world] or give special treatment to ~il[stobj]s.

  It is important to understand that if ~c[:native t] is specified, then all
  other options are interpreted by the native Lisp trace.  For example, that
  trace probably has no understanding of the use of ~c[:fmt] described above
  for ~c[:entry] or ~c[:exit].  Indeed, the native trace may not even accept
  any of ~c[:cond], ~c[:entry] or ~c[:exit], let alone any of the advanced
  options!  Moreover, if ~c[:native t] is specified, then even a
  ~c[:multiplicity] option does not provide the meaning of the variable
  ~c[values] that one might desire.  In GCL for example, in the case of an
  ~ilc[mv] return of a function defined only in raw Lisp (not in ACL2), this
  variable will be bound to a list containing only the first result.

  ~c[:NOTINLINE]

  By default, a new definition installed by ~c[trace$] will include a
  ~c[notinline] declaration so that recursive calls will always be traced.  To
  avoid this declaration, supply value ~c[nil].

  A special value for ~c[:notinline], ~c[:fncall], will cause the traced
  function to call its original definition.  Without this special value, the
  new installed definition for the traced function will include the body of the
  original definition.  This ~c[:fncall] behavior is the default only in the
  following cases:
  ~bq[]
  o for functions whose definitions are built into ACL2;

  o for functions that have been added (using a trust tag, an advanced feature,
  so most users can probably ignore this case) to either of the ~ilc[state]
  global variables ~c[program-fns-with-raw-code] or
  ~c[logic-fns-with-raw-code];

  o (`HONS' extension only; ~pl[hons-and-memoization]) for ~ilc[memoize]d
  functions.~eq[]

  The legal values for ~c[:notinline] are ~c[t] (the default for other than the
  cases displayed above), ~c[nil], and ~c[:fncall].  (Except: For the 'HONS'
  extension, only ~c[:fncall] is legal.)

  ~st[Remarks].

  (1) If some of the given trace specs have errors, then ~c[trace$] will
  generally print error messages for those but will still process those that do
  not have errors.  The value returned will indicate the trace specs that were
  processed successfully.

  (2) If you certify or include a book that redundantly defines a function that
  is currently traced, then tracing behavior may disappear if a compiled
  definition is installed for the function or its in-the-logic (so-called
  `*1*') counterpart.

  (3) Some predefined functions are called during tracing.  In order to avoid
  infinite loops, such calls of traced predefined functions will be made using
  the original predefined functions, not using their code installed by
  ~c[trace$].~/"

  ~c[Trace!] is a version of ~ilc[trace$] that avoids the need for an

  ~l[trace$] for when a trust tag can be necessary.

  ~l[untrace$] for how to undo the effect of ~ilc[trace!].

  The evaluation of a ~c[trace!] form causes temporary creation of an active
  trust tag, ~c[:trace!], followed by the corresponding ~c[trace$] form.  The
  trust tag will disappear when the call to ~c[trace!] completes.  Even though
  ~c[trace!] will remove its temporary ttag, it will still print a
  ``~c[TTAG NOTE]'', which indicates that the session is suspect.  ~l[defttag]
  and ~pl[ttags-seen] for further remarks on this issue.

  Because of the active trust tag, it is possible to do things with ~c[trace!]
  that are useful but without logical justification.  Below is an example of
  how to use ~c[trace!] to cause a function call to change ~il[state], even
  though the function does not take ~ilc[state] as a parameter.

  Computing the guard conjecture for FACT....

  The guard conjecture for FACT is trivial to prove, given the :compound-
  recognizer rules NATP-COMPOUND-RECOGNIZER and ZP-COMPOUND-RECOGNIZER,
  primitive type reasoning and the :type-prescription rule FACT.  FACT
  is compliant with Common Lisp.

  ~ev[]

  Finally, we remark that the use ~c[trace!] can cause errors in situations
  where tracing is automatically suspended and re-introduced.  This is likely
  to be a rare occurrence, but consider the following example.
  ~bv[]
  (trace! (lexorder :native t :multiplicity 1))
  (certify-book \"foo\" 0 t)
  ~ev[]
  If the certify-book causes compilation, you may see an error such as the
  following.
  ~bv[]

  ACL2 Error in (CERTIFY-BOOK \"foo\" ...):  The keyword :NATIVE cannot
  be used in a trace spec unless there is an active trust tag.  The trace
  spec (LEXORDER :NATIVE T :MULTIPLICITY 1) is thus illegal.  Consider
  using trace! instead.  The complete list of keywords that require a
  trust tag for use in a trace spec is: (:NATIVE :DEF :MULTIPLICITY).

  ~ev[]
  This error is harmless.  The function will appear, when calling ~c[(trace$)],
  to remain traced, but in fact there will be no tracing behavior, so you may
  want to call ~ilc[untrace$] on the function symbol in question.

  ~c[(Break-on-error)] generates a suitable trace of error functions.  Evaluate
  ~c[(trace$)] after ~c[(break-on-error)] if you want to see the specific trace
  forms (which you can modify and then submit directly to ~c[trace$], if you
  wish).  This ~il[trace] should cause entry to the Lisp debugger whenever ACL2
  calls its error routines, except for certain errors when inside the theorem
  prover, and also at those times if option :all is supplied.

  NOTE: For technical reasons, you may see some error messages more than once.

  Finally, note that you are welcome to define your own version of
  ~c[break-on-error] by modifying a copy of the source definition (search for
  ``~c[(defmacro break-on-error]'' in ACL2 source file other-events.lisp).
  Please feel free to send your version of ~c[break-on-error] to the ACL2
  implementors, for possible inclusion into ACL2.

  ~c[Break-on-error] is implmented using ACL2 ~ilc[trace$].  ~l[trace!] if you
  want an explanation of the ``~c[TTAG NOTE]'' that is printed.

  The argument, if supplied, is evaluated and must evaluate to ~c[t], ~c[nil],
  or ~c[:all].

  Also ~pl[set-debugger-enable] for how to get raw-Lisp backtrace information
  when an error occurs as a result of ~c[break-on-error], or even of a raw Lisp
  error, by calling ~c[set-debugger-enable] with argument ~c[:bt],
  ~c[:bt-break], or ~c[:break-bt].  Note that for ACL2 errors (as opposed to
  raw Lisp errors), i.e. errors affected by ~c[break-on-error], all three of
  those keyword values are treated equivalently (and, all are ignored for
  GCL; ~pl[set-debugger-enable]).~/~/"

  attach a terminating executable function to a definition~/
  
  Suppose you define a function ~c[(fn x)] with a ~il[guard] of
  ~c[(good-input-p x)], and you know that when the guard holds, the measure
  decreases on each recursive call.  Unfortunately, the definitional principle
  (~pl[defun]) ignores the guard.  For example, if the definition has the form
  ~bv[]
  (defun fn (x)
    (declare (xargs :guard (good-input-p x)))
    (if (not-done-yet x)
        (... (fn (destr x)) ...)
      ...))
  ~ev[]
  then in order to admit this definition, ACL2 must prove the appropriate
  formula asserting that ~c[(destr x)] is ``smaller than'' ~c[x] under the
  assumption ~c[(not-done-yet x)] but without the assumption
  ~c[(good-input-p x)], even if ~c[(not-done-yet x)] is true.  In essence, it
  may be necessary to submit instead the following definition. 
  ~bv[]
  (defun fn (x)
    (declare (xargs :guard (good-input-p x)))
    (if (good-input-p x)
        (if (not-done-yet x)
            (... (fn (destr x)) ...)
          ...)
      nil)
  ~ev[]
  But it is unfortunate that when calls of ~c[fn] are evaluated, for example
  when ~c[fn] is applied to an explicit constant during a proof, then a call of
  ~c[good-input-p] must now be evaluated on each recursive call.

  Fortunately, ~c[defexec] provides a way to keep the execution efficient.  For
  the example above we could use the following form.
  ~bv[]
  (defexec fn (x)
    (declare (xargs :guard (good-input-p x)))
    (mbe :logic (if (good-input-p x)
                    (if (not-done-yet x)
                        (... (fn (destr x)) ...)
                      ...)
                  nil)
         :exec  (if (not-done-yet x)
                    (... (fn (destr x)) ...)
                  ...)))
  ~ev[]
  Here ``~ilc[mbe]'' stands for ``must be equal'' and, roughly speaking, its
  call above is logically equal to the ~c[:logic] form but is evaluated using
  the ~c[:exec] form when the guard holds.  ~l[mbe].  The effect is thus to
  define ~c[fn] as shown in the ~ilc[defun] form above, but to cause execution
  of ~c[fn] using the ~c[:exec] body.  The use of ~c[defexec] instead of
  ~ilc[defun] in the example above causes a termination proof to be performed,
  in order to guarantee that evaluation always theoretically terminates, even
  when using the ~c[:exec] form for evaluation.

  Notice that in the example above, the ~c[:]~ilc[hints] in the ~ilc[local]
  definition of ~c[F] are inherited from the ~c[:hints] in the ~ilc[xargs] of
  the ~c[defexec] form.  We discuss such inheritance below.

  ~sc[Caveat]: Termination is not considered for calls of ~ilc[mbe] under the
  top-level call.  Moreover, the ~c[:exec] part of an ~ilc[mbe] call under the
  ~c[:logic] part of any superior ~c[mbe] call is completely ignored.

  ~bv[]
  General Form:
  (defexec fn (var1 ... varn) doc-string dcl ... dcl
    (mbe :LOGIC logic-body
         :EXEC  exec-body))
  ~ev[]
  where the syntax is identical to the syntax of ~ilc[defun] where the body is
  a call of ~c[mbe], with the exceptions described below.  Thus, ~c[fn] is the
  symbol you wish to define and is a new symbolic name and ~c[(var1 ... varn)]
  is its list of formal parameters (~pl[name]).  The first exception is that at
  least one ~c[dcl] (i.e., ~ilc[declare] form) must specify a ~c[:guard],
  ~c[guard].  The second exception is that one of the ~c[dcl]s is allowed to
  contain an element of the form ~c[(exec-xargs ...)].  The ~c[exec-xargs]
  form, if present, must specify a non-empty ~ilc[keyword-value-listp] each of
  whose keys is one of ~c[:test], ~c[:default-value], or one of the standard
  ~ilc[xargs] keys of ~c[:measure], ~c[:ruler-extenders],
  ~c[:well-founded-relation], ~c[:hints], or ~c[:stobjs].  Any of these five
  standard ~c[xargs] keys that is present in an ~c[xargs] of some ~c[dcl] but
  is not specified in the (possibly nonexistent) ~c[exec-xargs] form is
  considered to be specified in the ~c[exec-xargs] form, as illustrated in the
  example above for ~c[:hints].  (So for example, if you want ~c[:hints] in the
  final, non-local definition but not in the local definition, then specify the
  ~c[:hints] in the ~c[xargs] but specify ~c[:hints nil] in the
  ~c[exec-xargs].)  If ~c[:test] is specified and not ~c[nil], let ~c[test] be
  its value; otherwise let ~c[test] default to ~c[guard].  If
  ~c[:default-value] is specified, let ~c[default-value] be its value; else
  ~c[default-value] is ~c[nil].  ~c[Default-value] should have the same
  ~il[signature] as ~c[exec-body]; otherwise the ~c[defexec] form will fail to
  be admitted.

  The above General Form's macroexpansion is of the form
  ~c[(PROGN encap final-def)], where ~c[encap] and ~c[final-def] are as
  follows.  ~c[Final-def] is simply the result of removing the ~c[exec-xargs]
  declaration (if any) from its ~ilc[declare] form, and is the result of
  evaluating the given ~c[defexec] form, since ~c[encap] is of the following
  form.

  The purpose of ~c[encap] is to ensure the the executable version of ~c[name]
  terminates on all arguments.  Thus, ~c[local-def] and ~c[local-thm] are as
  follows, where the ~c[xargs] of the ~ilc[declare] form are the result of
  adding ~c[:VERIFY-GUARDS NIL] to the result of removing the ~c[:test] and
  (optional) ~c[:default-value] from the ~c[exec-xargs].

  ~ev[]
  We claim that if the above ~c[local-def] and ~c[local-thm] are admitted, then
  all evaluations of calls of ~c[fn] terminate.  The concern is that the use
  of ~ilc[mbe] in ~c[final-def] allows for the use of ~c[exec-body] for a call
  of ~c[fn], as well as for subsequent recursive calls, when ~c[guard] holds
  and assuming that the guards have been verified for ~c[final-def].  However,
  by ~c[local-thm] we can conclude in this case that ~c[test] holds, in which
  case the call of ~c[fn] may be viewed as a call of the version of ~c[fn]
  defined in ~c[local-def].  Moreover, since guards have been verified for
  ~c[final-def], then guards hold for subsequent evaluation of ~c[exec-body],
  and in particular for recursive calls of ~c[fn], which can thus continue to
  be viewed as calls using ~c[local=def].~/~/

; will try to do more, namely relieve all the hyps by instantiating free
; variables.  So we avoid doing any instantiation in forming the sar record.
; Actually, if we knew that rewriting were to be done with the empty
; substitution, then we'd go ahead and store the result of trying to relieve
; hypotheses at this point; but we don't.  Nevertheless, we should have a
; function that takes the fields of an sar record and returns an appropriate
; structure representing the result of trying to relieve the hyps (possibly
; starting with a unify-subst extending the one that was originally produced).

  Also ~pl[pl2], which restricts output to rules that you specify for a given
  term.

  ~c[Pl] takes one argument, which should be a symbol or a term.

  First suppose that the argument is a symbol.  Then it should be either a
  function symbol or else a macro alias for a function symbol
  (~pl[macro-aliases-table]), which is treated as the corresponding function
  symbol.  In this case ~c[:pl] displays rules that apply to terms whose top
  function symbol is the one specified, specifically, rules of class
  ~c[:]~ilc[rewrite], ~c[:]~ilc[definition], ~c[:]~ilc[meta],
  ~c[:]~ilc[linear], ~c[:]~ilc[type-prescription], ~c[:]~ilc[forward-chaining],
  ~c[:]~ilc[elim], and ~c[:]~ilc[induction].

  Otherwise the argument should be a term (in user syntax, so that for example
  macros are permitted).  In this case, ~c[:pl] displays the
  ~c[:]~ilc[rewrite], ~c[:]~ilc[definition], and ~c[:meta] rules that rewrite
  the specified term, followed by the applicable ~c[:]~ilc[type-prescription]
  rules.  Each rule is displayed with additional information, such as the
  hypotheses that remain after applying some simple techniques to discharge
  them that are likely to apply in any context.  Note that for ~c[:]~ilc[meta]
  rules, only those are displayed that meet two conditions: the application of
  the metafunction returns a term different from the input term, and if there
  is a hypothesis metafunction then it also returns a term.  (A subtlety: In
  the case of extended metafunctions (~pl[extended-metafunctions]), a trivial
  metafunction context is used for the application of the metafunction.)

  Note that some rule classes are not handled by ~c[:pl].  In particular, if
  you want to see all ~c[:]~ilc[clause-processor] rules, issue the command
  ~c[:print-clause-processor-rules], and for trusted clause-processors,
  ~c[(table trusted-clause-processor-table)]; ~pl[clause-processor] and
  ~pl[define-trusted-clause-processor].~/"

  (list 'pl-fn name 'state))

(defmacro pl2 (form rule-id)

  :pl2 (+ x y) nil ; prints rules that apply to (+ x y)
  :pl2 (+ x y) foo ; prints rules named foo that apply to (+ x y)
  :pl2 (+ x y) (:rewrite foo) ; if the rule with rune (:rewrite foo) applies
                              ;   to (+ x y), then print it
  :pl2 (+ x y) (:type-prescription foo)
                              ; as above, but for the indicated
                              ;   type-prescription rule
  ~ev[]~/

  ~c[Pl2] takes two arguments.  The first is a term.  The second is either
  ~c[nil] or a ``rule-id'' that is either a symbol or a ~il[rune].  The result
  is to print rules of class ~c[:]~ilc[rewrite], ~c[:]~ilc[definition],
  ~c[:meta], ~c[:]~ilc[linear], and ~c[:]~ilc[type-prescription] that apply to
  the given term.  Indeed, ~c[:pl2] prints exactly what is printed by applying
  ~c[:]~ilc[pl] to the first argument ~-[] ~pl[pl] ~-[] except that if the
  second argument is not ~c[nil] then it is used to filter the rules printed,
  as follows.~bq[]

  If the rule-id is a symbol, then only rules whose name is that symbol will be
  printed.

  If the rule-id is a ~il[rune], then at most one rule will be printed: the
  rule named by that rune (if the rule would be printed by
  ~c[:]~ilc[pl]).~eq[]~/"

; Essay on Include-book-dir-alist

; The :include-book-dir-alist field of the acl2-defaults-table supports the
; :dir argument of include-book and ld, by associating keywords (used as values
; of :dir) with absolute directory pathnames.  The macro add-include-book-dir
; provides a way to extend that field.  Up through ACL2 Version_3.6.1, when
; add-include-book-dir was executed in raw Lisp it would be ignored, because it
; macroexpanded to a table event.  But consider a file loaded in raw Lisp, say
; when we are in raw-mode and are executing an include-book command with a :dir
; argument.  If that :dir value were defined by an add-include-book-dir event
; also evaluated in raw Lisp, and hence ignored, then that :dir value would not
; really be defined after all and the include-book would fail.

; The above problem with raw-mode could be explained away by saying that
; raw-mode is a hack, and you get what you get.  But Version_4.0 introduced the
; loading of compiled files before corresponding event processing, which causes
; routine evaluation of add-include-book-dir and include-book in raw Lisp.

; Therefore we maintain for raw Lisp a variant of the acl2-default-table's
; include-book-dir-alist, namely state global 'raw-include-book-dir-alist.  The
; value of this variable is initially :ignore, meaning that we are to use the
; acl2-default-table's include-book-dir-alist.  But when the value is not
; :ignore, then it is an alist that is used as the include-book-dir-alist.  We
; guarantee that every embedded event form that defines handling of :dir values
; for include-book does so in a manner that works when loading compiled files,
; and we weakly extend this guarantee to raw-mode as well (weakly, since we
; cannot perfectly control raw-mode but anyhow, a trust tag is necessary to
; enter raw-mode so our guarantee need not be ironclad).  The above :ignore
; value must then be set to a legitimate include-book-alist when inside
; include-book or (generally) raw-mode, and should remain :ignore when not in
; those contexts.  When the value is not :ignore, then execution of
; add-include-book-dir will extend the value of 'raw-include-book-dir-alist
; instead of modifying the acl2-defaults-table.  And whenever we execute
; include-book in raw Lisp, we use this value instead of the one in the
; acl2-defaults-table, by binding it to nil upon entry.  Thus, any
; add-include-book-dir will be local to the book, which respects the semantics
; of include-book.  We bind it to nil because that is also how include-book
; works: the acl2-defaults-table initially has an empty :include-book-dir-alist
; field (see process-embedded-events).

; In order to be able to rely on the above scheme, we disallow any direct table
; update of the :include-book-dir-alist field of the acl2-defaults-table.  We
; use the state global 'modifying-include-book-dir-alist for this purpose,
; which is globally nil but is bound to t by add-include-book-dir and
; delete-include-book-dir.  We insist that it be non-nil in chk-table-guard.
; We considered doing it in chk-embedded-event-form, but that would have been
; more awkward, and more importantly, it would have allowed such direct updates
; when developing a book interactively but not when certifying the book, which
; could provide a rude surprise to the user at certification time.

  top-level compound ~il[command] containing it, which for example might be an
  ~ilc[include-book]) is assigned the number 0.  The only way to undo this
  command is with command ~ilc[ubt-prehistory].  However, even that is
  disallowed if ~c[permanent-p] is ~c[t].

  Note that the second argument of ~ilc[certify-book], which specifies the
  number of commands in the certification world (i.e., since ground-zero), is
  not sensitive to ~c[reset-prehistory]; rather, it expects the number of
  commands since ground-zero.  To see such commands,
  ~c[:]~ilc[pbt]~c[ :start].

  A ~c[reset-prehistory] event with value ~c[nil] for ~c[permanent-p] (the
  default) is always skipped during ~ilc[certify-book] and ~ilc[include-book]
  (indeed, whenever ~ilc[ld-skip-proofsp] is ~c[t]).  Otherwise one would find
  the history numbering reset to 0 just by virtue of including (or certifying) a

  By default, ACL2 holds on to old logical ~il[world]s when you undo

  memory by deleting those old worlds using ~c[reset-kill-ring].

  (reset-kill-ring 2 state)   ; create a new kill ring of '(nil nil)
  (reset-kill-ring 0 state)   ; create a new kill ring that is empty
  (reset-kill-ring nil state) ; just return the length of the kill ring

  General form:
  (reset-kill-ring n state)
  ~ev[]
  where ~c[n] evaluates either to ~c[t], to ~c[nil], or to a nonnegative
  integer (a ~ilc[natp]).  If ~c[n] evaluates to ~c[t], it is treated as the
  length of the current kill ring.  If ~c[n] is ~c[nil], then the length ~c[k]
  of the current kill ring is returned as a value triple ~c[(mv nil k state)].
  If ~c[n] is a ~ilc[natp], then the kill ring is replaced with a list of ~c[n]
  ~c[nil]s.

; Although this function is generally only called with #+hons, nevertheless we

; The usual table guard mechanism provides crude error messages when there is a
; violation.  We avoid that problem by causing a hard error.  We rely on the
; fact that illegal and hard-error return nil.

; The memoize-table maps :common-lisp-compliant function symbols (to be
; memoized or unmemoized) to nil (unmemoized) or to a non-empty alist that
; stores relevant information, such as the condition (see memoize-form).  The
; guard requirement then ensures that when we call the raw Lisp version of fn,
; then since the guard for fn must hold in that case, so does the guard for
; condition-fn.  The body of condition-fn can therefore be called in raw Lisp
; on the arguments of any call of fn made in raw Lisp from the ACL2
; read-eval-print loop.  This is important because the memoized function body
; includes code from the body of condition-fn.

  print a form whose evaluation caused a guard violation~/

  By default, ACL2 checks input constraints on functions, known as
  ~il[guard]s.  When guards are violated, an informative message is printed;
  but sometimes it is useful to investigate why the guard check fails.  The
  utility ~c[print-gv] is provided for that purpose.  (Alternatively, you may
  prefer to avoid guards entirely with ~c[(set-guard-checking :none)];
  ~pl[set-guard-checking].)
  ~bv[]
  Example Forms:
  (print-gv)
  (print-gv :evisc-tuple (evisc-tuple 4 4 nil nil))
  (print-gv :evisc-tuple (evisc-tuple 4 ; print-level
                                      5 ; print-length
                                      (world-evisceration-alist state nil)
                                      nil ; hiding-cars
                                      ))
  ~ev[]~/
  ~bv[]
  General Form:
  (print-gv :evisc-tuple x)
  ~ev[]
  where the ~c[:evisc-tuple] argument is optional and defaults to one that
  hides only the ACL2 logical ~il[world], by printing ~c[<world>] instead of a
  very large structure.  ~l[evisc-tuple] for a discussion of evisc-tuples.

  To see how one might use ~c[print-gv], consider the following definition.
  ~bv[]
  (defun foo (x)
    (declare (xargs :guard (and (my-first-predicate x)
                                (my-second-predicate x))))
    (cdr x))
  ~ev[]
  Now suppose we evaluate a call of ~c[foo] and obtain a guard violation.
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>(foo 3)


  ACL2 Error in TOP-LEVEL:  The guard for the function call (FOO X),
  which is (AND (MY-FIRST-PREDICATE X) (MY-SECOND-PREDICATE X)), is violated
  by the arguments in the call (FOO 3).  To debug: See :DOC print-gv,
  see :DOC trace, and see :DOC wet.  See :DOC set-guard-checking for
  information about suppressing this check with (set-guard-checking :none),
  as recommended for new users.

  ACL2 !>
  ~ev[]
  We can obtain (in essence) the guard form that was false, as follows.
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>(print-gv)

  (LET ((X '3))
       (DECLARE (IGNORABLE X))
       (AND (MY-FIRST-PREDICATE X)
            (MY-SECOND-PREDICATE X)))

  ACL2 !>
  ~ev[]
  But which conjunct is to blame?  With a bit of editing we can try each
  conjunct in turn.
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>(LET ((X '3))
              (DECLARE (IGNORABLE X))
              (MY-FIRST-PREDICATE X))
  T
  ACL2 !>(LET ((X '3))
              (DECLARE (IGNORABLE X))
              (MY-SECOND-PREDICATE X))
  NIL
  ACL2 !>
  ~ev[]
  Aha!  Now we can investigate why the second predicate fails for 3.

  The following hack will give you access in raw Lisp to the form printed by
  ~c[(print-gv)].  After a guard violation, just submit this form to raw Lisp:
  ~bv[]
  (print-gv1 (wormhole-data (cdr (assoc 'ev-fncall-guard-er-wormhole
                                        *wormhole-status-alist*)))
             state)
  ~ev[]

  If you use local ~il[stobj]s (~pl[with-local-stobj]) or stobj fields of
  stobjs, you may need to edit the output of ~c[print-gv] in order to evaluate
  it.  Consider the following example.
  ~bv[]
  (defstobj st fld)

  (defun g (x st)
    (declare (xargs :guard (consp x) :stobjs st)
             (ignore x))
    (fld st))

  (defun test ()
    (with-local-stobj
     st
     (mv-let (result st)
             (mv (g 3 st) st)
             result)))

  (test)
  ~ev[]
  Then ~c[:print-gv] yields the result shown below.
  ~bv[]
  (FLET ((G{GUARD} (X ST)
                   (DECLARE (IGNORABLE X ST))
                   (AND (STP ST) (CONSP X))))
        (G{GUARD} '3 |<some-stobj>|))
  ~ev[]
  In this example you could replace ``~c[|<some-stobj>|]'' by ``~c[st]'' to
  obtain a result of ~c[nil].  But similar cases may require the use of a local
  stobj that is no longer available, in which case you may need to be creative
  in order to take advantage of ~c[:print-gv].  Here is such an example.
  ~bv[]
  (defstobj st2 fld2)

  (defun g2 (st2)
    (declare (xargs :guard (null (fld2 st2)) :stobjs st2))
    (mv 0 st2))

  (defun test2 ()
    (with-local-stobj
     st2
     (mv-let (result st2)
             (let ((st2 (update-fld2 17 st2)))
               (g2 st2))
             result)))

  (test2)
  ~ev[]
  In this case, ~c[:print-gv] yields the following.

  control whether abbreviated output can be read back in~/

  When ACL2 pretty-prints large expressions using formatted printing
  (~pl[fmt]), it may save time and space by printing tokens `~c[#]' or
  `~c[...]' in place of certain subexpressions.  By default this only happens
  for a few settings such as error and warning messages; ~pl[set-evisc-tuple]
  for controlling such elision in general.  The full expression is unavailable
  to the user when `~c[#]' or `~c[...]' is printed, but that is easily solved
  by evaluating the form
  ~bv[]
    (set-iprint t)
  ~ev[]
  to enable a mode called ``iprinting''.  Then, instead of printing `~c[#]' or
  `~c[...]', ACL2 prints `~c[#@i#]' for ~c[i] = 1,2,3,... ~-[] all in base 10.
  ACL2 can read back in such `~c[#@i#]' because under the hood, ~c[i] is
  associated with its corresponding elided form.  Thus the term ``iprint'' can
  be viewed as suggesting ``interactive print'' or ``index print''.  We also
  think of ``iprint'' as suggesting ``~c[i] printing'', to suggest the printing
  of token `~c[#@i#]'.  We call ~c[i] the ``iprint index'' of that token.

  The following example should suffice to illustrate how to recover elided
  subexpressions.  (Below this example we provide details that may be of
  interest only to advanced users.)  Here we cause an error by defining a macro
  of one argument and then calling it with two arguments.  By default, error
  messages abbreviate subexpressions deeper than level 5 with `~c[#]' and past
  the 7th element of a list with `~c[...]'.  We see this behavior below.

  Sometimes you may want to supply the abbreviated form not to compute with it,
  as in the ~ilc[acl2-count] example just above, but so that you can see it.
  The macro ~ilc[without-evisc] eliminates elision during printing.  Below we
  show two ways to use this utility: first, we use it to print the elided form,
  and then, we use it instead on the original input form to print the entire
  error message.

  The documentation above probably suffices for most users.  For those who want
  more details, below we detail all the ways to use the ~c[set-iprint]
  utility.~/

  ~bv[]
  Example Forms:
  (set-iprint t)   ; enable iprinting (elision with #@i@)
  (set-iprint nil) ; disable iprinting

  General Form:
  (set-iprint action        ; t, nil, :reset, :reset-enable, or :same
              :soft-bound s ; initially  1000
              :hard-bound h ; initially 10000)
  ~ev[]
  where all arguments are optional, but ACL2 queries for ~c[action] if it is
  omitted.   We defer the explanations of ~c[:soft-bound] and ~c[:hard-bound].
  The values for ~c[action] are as follows:
  ~bq[]

  ~c[T] ~-[] Enable iprinting.

  ~c[NIL] ~-[] Disable iprinting.

  ~c[:RESET] ~-[] Reset iprinting to its initial disabled state, so that when
  enabled, the first index ~c[i] for which `~c[#@i#] is printed will be 1.
  Note that all stored information for existing iprint indices will be erased.

  ~c[:RESET-ENABLE] ~-[] Reset iprinting as with ~c[:reset], and then enable
  iprinting.

  ~c[:SAME] ~-[] Make no change to the iprinting state (other than setting the
  ~c[:soft-bound] and/or ~c[:hard-bound] if specified, as explained
  below).~eq[]

  Immediately after a top-level form is read, hence before it is evaluated, a
  check is made for whether the latest iprint index exceeds a certain bound,
  ~c[(iprint-soft-bound state)] ~-[] 1000, by default.  If so, then the
  ~c[(iprint-last-index state)] is set back to 0.  This soft bound can be
  changed to any positive integer ~c[k] by calling ~c[set-iprint] with
  ~c[:soft-bound k], typically ~c[(set-iprint :same :soft-bound k])].

  The above ``soft bound'' is applied once for each top-level form, but you may
  want finer control by applying a bound after the pretty-printing of each
  individual form (since many forms may be pretty-printed between successive
  evaluations of top-level forms).  That bound is
  ~c[(iprint-hard-bound state)], and can be set with the ~c[:hard-bound]
  argument in analogy to how ~c[:soft-bound] is set, as described above.

  A ``rollover'' is the detection that the soft or hard bound has been
  exceeded, along with a state update so that the next iprint index will be 1.
  When a rollover occurs, any index beyond the latest iprint index is no longer
  available for reading.  At the top level of the ACL2 read-eval-print loop,
  this works as follows: ACL2 reads the next top-level form according to the
  current iprint state, then handles a rollover if the latest iprint index
  exceeded the current soft bound.  The following log illustrates a rollover,
  which follows the description above.
  ~bv[]

  We conclude by mentioning two cases where iprinting and evisc-tuples are
  ignored.  (1) This is typically the case when printing results in raw Lisp
  outside the ACL2 loop.  To use iprinting and evisc-tuples in raw Lisp, use
  raw-mode; ~pl[set-raw-mode].  In raw-mode, results that are ACL2 objects will
  be printed in the same way that ACL2 would print those results if not in
  raw-mode.  (2) Iprinting and evisc-tuples are ignored by ~ilc[print-object$],
  which however is sensitive to many settings that do not affect formatted
  (~ilc[fmt] etc.) printing; ~pl[print-control].

  The reader interested in design and implementation issues considered during
  the addition of iprinting to ACL2 is invited to read the paper ``Abbreviated
  Output for Input in ACL2: An Implementation Case Study''; see the proceedings
  of ACL2 Workshop 2009,

  control suppression of details when printing~/

  ACL2 output is generally printed in full.  However, ACL2 can be directed to
  abbreviate, or ``eviscerate'', objects before printing them, though the use
  of a so-called ``evisc-tuple''.  ~l[evisc-tuple] for a discussion of
  evisc-tuples.  The utility ~c[set-evisc-tuple] modifies certain global
  evisc-tuples, as explained below, to affect the extent to which ACL2
  eviscerates objects during printing, for example during proof output or when
  printing top-level evaluation results.

  We recommend however using ~c[:iprint t] so that eviscerated terms may be
  read back in; ~pl[set-iprint].  Indeed, the ~c[:iprint] argument is required
  as a reminder to the user to consider that issue, unless iprinting has been
  enabled at least once.  If ~c[:sites] or a required ~c[:iprint] argument is
  omitted, however, ACL2 will query the user for the missing arguments rather
  than causing an error.

  ACL2 eviscerates by default only in a few cases, primarily in informational
  messages for errors, warnings, and queries (i.e., in the ~c[:EVISC] case
  below).  Users can modify the default behavior by supplying a suitable
  argument to ~c[set-evisc-tuple].  The argument may be ~c[:default], which
  denotes the evisceration provided when ACL2 starts up.  Otherwise that
  argument is an evisc-tuple, which is either ~c[nil] (no evisceration) or as
  described above.  Moreover, there are four evisc-tuple ``evisceration
  contexts'', each with its own evisceration control.  The value returned by
  ~c[set-evisc-tuple] indicates the evisceration contexts whose evisc-tuple has
  been set.  The evisceration contexts are as follows, all of which use a
  default value of ~c[nil] for the hiding-cars.  Accessors are also shown for
  retrieving the corresponding evisc-tuple.
  ~bq[]

  o ~c[:TERM] ~-[] used for printing terms.  The accessor is
  ~c[(term-evisc-tuple flg state)], where ~c[flg] is ignored if
  ~c[set-evisc-tuple] has been called for ~c[:term] with value other than
  ~c[:default], and otherwise (hence initially): a ~c[flg] of ~c[nil] indicates
  an evisc-tuple of ~c[nil], and otherwise the term-evisc-tuple has a
  print-level of 3 and print-length of 4.

  o ~c[:ABBREV] ~-[] used for printing informational messages for errors,
  warnings, and queries.  Initially, the alist abbreviates the ACL2
  ~c[world], print-level is 5, and print-level is 7.  The accessor is
  ~c[(abbrev-evisc-tuple state)].

  o ~c[:GAG-MODE] ~-[] used for printing induction schemes (and perhaps, in the
  future, for other printing) when ~il[gag-mode] is on.  If gag-mode is off,
  the value used for this ~il[evisc-tuple] is ~c[(term-evisc-tuple nil state)].
  But if gag-mode is on (i.e., ~c[(gag-mode)] evaluates to a non-~c[nil]
  value), then with one exception, the value is an evisc-tuple or ~c[nil], to
  be used in gag-mode for printing of induction schemes and, during proofs, the
  ``The non-trivial part of the guard conjecture''.  The exceptional value is
  ~c[t], which indicates that in gag-mode, no printing of induction schemes
  should be and the guard conjecture should be printed using
  ~c[(term-evisc-tuple t state)].  The accessor is
  ~c[(gag-mode-evisc-tuple state)].

  o ~c[:LD] ~-[] used by the ACL2 read-eval-print loop.  The accessor is
  ~c[(]~ilc[ld-evisc-tuple]~c[ state)].

  o ~c[:TRACE] ~-[] used for printing ~il[trace] output.  No accessor is
  available (though in raw Lisp, ~c[(trace-evisc-tuple)] returns the
  trace-evisc-tuple).~eq[]

  Each context ~c[ectx] also has an updater,
  ~c[(set-ectx-evisc-tuple val state)], where ~c[val] is a legal value for
  ~c[set-evisc-tuple] as described above: ~c[:default] or an ~il[evisc-tuple]
  (possibly ~c[nil]).~/

  Note that the ~il[break-rewrite] commands and the ~il[proof-checker]
  generally do their printing using the term-evisc-tuple.~/"

  Some forms, such as calls of ~ilc[with-local-stobj], are illegal when
  supplied directly to the ACL2 top-level loop.  The macro ~c[top-level]
  provides a workaround in such cases, by defining a temporary

  is ~c[state] and whose body is the form to be evaluated.  When the call of
  ~c[top-level] returns there is no change to the existing ACL2 logical
  ~il[world].  The following edited log illustrates all of the above points.

; Essay on Defattach

; In this essay we discuss both the implementation of defattach and its logical
; characterization.

; We begin by introducing some terminology.  We refer to the "substitution of"
; a defattach event, i.e. its "attachment substitution" or "attachment-alist",
; as the functional substitution specified in the event.  An "attachment pair"
; <f,g> is an ordered pair of function symbols f and g such that g is the
; "current attachment" of f: that is, <f,g> is a pair from the substitution of
; a defattach event active in the current ACL2 world.  If <f.g> is an
; attachment pair, then the corresponding "attachment axiom" is defined to be
; the formula (equal (f x1 ... xk) (g x1 ... xk)), where the xi are the formals
; of f.  When we treat this attachment axiom as an event, we consider it
; logically to be a defun event that introduces f, in an "evaluation history"
; as described below.  Note that we only admit attachment pairs <f,g> with the
; same signatures (up to renaming of formals).

; In what follows we allow defaxiom events.  However, we insist on the
; following Defaxiom Restriction for Defattach: no ancestor (according to the
; transitive closure of the immediate-supporter relation) of a defaxiom event
; has an attachment.

; Most of the focus in this essay is on logical issues related to defattach,
; but we first say a few words about the implementation.

; In one sense we must disallow attachments to functions introduced by defun,
; since we need to generate our own defuns for attachable functions.  We can
; allow such attachments for logical purposes, however.  Consider the following
; silly example.

; (defstub f (x) t)
; (defun g (x)
;   (f x))
; (encapsulate ((h (x) t))
;   (local (defun h (x) (g x)))
;   (defthm h-prop
;     (equal (h x) (g x))))

; Imagine attaching acl2-numberp to f and also to h.  Our proof obligations are
; obtained by applying the attachment substitution to the conjunction of the
; constraints on f and h, in this case (equal (h x) (g x)).  Thus we must prove
; (equal (acl2-numberp x) (g x)) in the current ACL2 world.  But in that world
; we do not know that g is acl2-numberp.  The solution is to attach
; acl2-numberp to g as well.  Defattach has a syntax, :attach nil, that
; specifies that an attachment is not to be installed for execution; and that
; syntax would need to be used in the case of g.

; Thus, we only allow attachments for execution to functions introduced in
; signatures of encapsulate events.  (We do not expect attachments to defchoose
; functions, which can be simulated anyhow by using suitable wrappers.  But if
; such support becomes necessary, then we can probably provide it.)

; Of course, users can experiment with defattach without concern for proof
; obligations, by wrapping skip-proofs around defattach events.

; Since ACL2 supports two theories -- the current theory and its corresponding
; evaluation theory (described below) -- we add an argument to all ev functions
; (ev-w, ev-fncall, etc.), aok, specifying whether or not to use attachments.
; We will tend to use attachments at the top level but not in logical contexts,
; hence not under waterfall-step except in subroutines where it is again
; appropriate, such as evaluation of syntaxp expressions (ev-synp), meta rules,
; and clause-processor rules (see the Essay on Correctness of Meta Reasoning).
; Note that ev-fncall-rec-logical really needs this information.  With this
; fine-grained control of which of the two theories to use, we can for example
; arrange that mfc-rewrite behave the same inside syntaxp as does rewrite (at
; the top level), as suggested by Robert Krug.

; We next describe the implementation of defattach as an event.  In particular:
; Why is it a separate event type, rather than a macro that generates some
; other kind of event?

; We first considered following the precedent of :induction rules, using
; defthm.  But the user might find it unintuitive if defattach were skipped in
; :program mode, yet defthm is so skipped.  Moreover, we expected to generate
; Lisp code to do the attachment, but defthm doesn't generate any 'cltl-command
; property.

; We thus tentatively decided to implement defattach as a table event.  As a
; bonus, implementing defattach as a table event meant that we could follow the
; precedent of memoize/unmemoize.

; However, using a table event would be awkward.  If several attachments are
; made together (say, because several functions share a single constraint),
; then in order to remove one of those attachments, soundness demands that we
; remove them all.  (For, why did we require them all to be attached together
; in the first place?  Perhaps because we needed all those instantiations to be
; made together in order to prove the instantiated constraint.)  So undoing
; can't be done one function at a time, really; it needs to be atomic.  That
; could be managed, but it "feels" like it could potentially be awkward with
; table events.

; A bigger concern is that through Version_3.6.1, table events have not
; involved proof obligations, as indicated by a comment at the top of table-fn.
; Even merely expressing proof obligations in the language of tables seems
; awkward, unless perhaps we explicitly name each theorem that must be proved
; and refer to it by name in the table event.  And note that although we can do
; some fancy things within the context of table events (for example memoize
; generates a 'cltl-command), it seems much simpler not to have to do so in
; this case.

; It seems more natural, then, to invent a new event to handle attachment,
; rather than having defattach be a macro that expands to an existing event.
; At the time we started our implementation of defattach, there seemed to be
; fewer than 40 occurrences of set-body in the code, as determined by:
;   fgrep -i set-body /projects/acl2/devel/saved/*.lisp | wc -l
; So, we used set-body as a model for adding a new event.

; In general, we pick a canonical representative for the set of function
; symbols to which a defattach event is making attachments; call that
; representative f.  Then the 'attachment property of f is an alist matching
; function symbols to their attachments (including f); but the other function
; symbols in the nest have an 'attachment property of f -- reminiscent of
; handling of the 'constraint-lst property.  We maintain the invariant that for
; every function symbol g with an attachment h to its code, g is associated
; with h using the lookup method described above: if g is associated with an
; alist then h is the result of looking up g in that alist, else g is
; associated with a "canonical" symbol g' that is associated with an alist
; associating g with h.  (Note that this notion of "canonical" is not related
; to the notion of "canonical sibling", described elsewhere.)

; Turning now to logical issues:

; The fundamental guiding notion is that the attachment pairs extend the
; session's set of axioms to form what we call the "evaluation theory".  We say
; more about this theory (and its consistency) below.  But we also want to
; support the use of defattach for specifying refinements, with the following
; understanding: "refinement" means that the new function definitions, together
; with the attachment axioms, extend the current theory (to the evaluation
; theory), and this extension remains consistent, indeed with a standard model
; if there are no defaxiom events.  Moreover, it would be a kindness to the
; user if whenever an attachment substitution is subsequently used for
; functional instantiation, the resulting proof obligations generated are all
; dispatched without proof because they were cached at the time the defattach
; event was admitted.  However, we do not restrict the design to ensure
; definitively that this "kindness" must take place.

; Our logical characterization is based on the idea of an "evaluation theory",
; obtained by extending the current theory with the attachment axiom for each
; attachment pair.  We show that evaluation in the top-level loop is performed
; with respect to the evaluation theory.  Below we also show -- and this is
; where most of our effort lies -- that the evaluation theory is consistent,
; assuming that there are no defaxiom events in the current history.  More
; generally, we show that the evaluation theory is contained in the theory of a
; "evaluation history" containing no new defaxiom events, which replaces
; constraints in the original history by attachment axioms.  Consider the
; following example.

; (encapsulate ((f1 (x) t))
;              (local (defun f1 (x) x)))
;              (defthm f1-property
;                (consp (f1 (cons x x)))))
; (defun g1 (x)
;   (if (consp x) x (cons x x)))
; (defattach f1 g1)

; Then the corresponding evaluation history could be as follows, where we
; ignore the defattach event itself.

; (defun g1 (x)
;   (if (consp x) x (cons x x)))
; (defun f1 (x)
;   (g1 x))

; Of course, we could then prove that the original constraint holds for f1.

; (defthm f1-property
;   (consp (f1 (cons x x))))

; Indeed, that is critical: in order to show that the theory of the evaluation
; history extends that of the original history, we must guarantee that the
; original constraints on attached functions (hence on f1 in the example above)
; are provable in the evaluation history.  In the example above, notice that we
; have replaced the constraint of f1 by its definition using the attachment
; axiom.  The property exported from the original encapsulation on f1 now
; becomes a top-level theorem, which is provable because (consp (g1 (cons x
; x))) is provable, as this is the proof obligation generated by the defattach,
; and g1 and f1 are provably equal by the attachment axiom.

; But we must be careful.  Consider for example:

; (encapsulate ((f1 (x) t))
;              (local (defun f1 (x) x)))
; (defun g1 (x)
;   (not (f1 x)))
; (defattach f1 g1)

; Of course, g1 satisfies the constraint on f1, which is trivial.  Also notice
; that we can prove (thm (not (equal (f1 x) (g1 x)))) before the defattach
; event.  Yet after the defattach, (equal (f1 x) (g1 x)) will always compute to
; t, not nil!

; This example motivates an acylicity condition on functions and their
; attachments, explained below, that is sufficient for supporting a
; characterization of defattach events in terms of evaluation histories.  We
; next provide some motivation, before presenting the appropriate foundational
; theory.

; Consider first a defattach event that attaches certain gi to fi, where the fi
; are all the functions introduced by some individual encapsulate event and the
; gi are all defined before that encapsulate.  Imagine replacing the
; encapsulate by the attachment axioms discussed above, i.e., defining each fi
; to be the corresponding gi.  Before such replacement, the encapsulate's
; constraint is guaranteed to hold of the gi by our conditions for admitting
; the defattach event; therefore the original constraint on the fi trivially
; holds when we replace the encapsulate by these attachment axioms.  Thus, the
; replacement of the encapsulate by the attachment axioms gives us a stronger
; theory than the original theory; so it's pretty clear that the events after
; the encapsulate remain admissible after that replacement -- not that the ACL2
; prover could actually dispatch all proof obligations, but that all proof
; obligations are indeed theorems, since the history's axiom base has been
; strengthened.

; But in general, the gi might be defined *after* introduction of the
; corresponding fi.  For example, one can imagine that f1 is the :logic mode
; built-in function symbol too-many-ifs and g1 is defined by a user (much
; later) to be an efficient implementation.  Notice that in the first example
; displayed above, the definition of g1 could presumably have been made before
; f1, while that is not the case in the second (problematic) example above.

; Thus, although we need not insist that each gi be introduced before fi, we do
; insist that the definition of gi can be relocated to occur before the
; introduction of fi.  We thus provide a criterion that considers gi to be an
; "extended ancestor" of fi, the motivating idea being that gi is an ancestor
; (supporter) of fi in the evaluation history (because gi supports the
; definition of fi in the attachment axiom for <fi,gi>) and to insist that this
; extended ancestor relation is cycle-free.  More details are provided in the
; foundational theory presented below and considered at length in the Essay on
; Merging Attachment Records.

; Of course, if the acyclicity check succeeds then it continues to succeed when
; we remove attachment pairs.  But suppose one defattach event attaches to f1
; and f2 while a second attaches to f1 and f3.  It would be a mistake to leave
; the attachment of f2 in place when attaching to f1 and f3, as illustrated by
; the following example.  For simplicity, we abuse notation a little, sometimes
; writing a zero-ary function symbol, f, to denote a constant, (f), and
; sometimes writing a constant, e.g. 0, to denote a zero-ary function returning
; that value.

; (defstub f1 ...)
; constrain f2=f1
; constrain f3=f1
; (defattach ((f1 0) (f2 0)))
; (defattach ((f1 1) (f3 1)))

; If we don't eliminate the attachment to f2 when evaluating the second
; defattach, then we are left with the following, which violates the contraint
; f2=f1!

; f1=1
; f2=0
; f3=1

; We now make a more careful argument that the evaluation theory is contained
; in the theory of some so-called evaluation history.  To recap: We have
; specified that in order for a defattach event to be admissible, then if C is
; the conjunction of the constraints on the attached functions, the functional
; instance C\s must be a theorem, where s is the set of attachment pairs
; specified by the event.  We have also discussed the requirement for
; acyclicity of an extended ancestors relation; so next, we turn to specifying
; that relation precisely.  We begin by making a couple of remarks.  Note first
; that our arguments below will involve permuting top-level events.  We thus
; prefer not to think about events other than those at the top level, and we
; disallow defattach events except at the top-level; they are illegal inside
; non-trivial encapsulates.  We also assume the absence of trivial encapsulates
; and include-book forms, which can be replaced by the individual events
; within.

; Note that acyclicity checking is necessary even during the include-book pass
; of certify-book (and similarly by any include-book, though we restrict
; attention here to the former case).  Consider the following example.

; (defattach f ...) ; first defattach
; (local (defattach f ...)) ; second defattach
; (defattach ...) ; third defattach

; If the first and third defattach events interact to form a loop, but the
; second and third do not, then the first pass of book certification would not
; catch a loop, but the include-book pass would encounter a loop that needs to
; be detected.

; Acyclicity checking will be unnecessary when including a certified book in a
; world where there are no defattach events outside the boot-strap world,
; because the necessary acyclicity checks for the book's defattach events were
; already made when certifying the book, during its include-book pass.  (At the
; time of this writing, however, no such optimization is implemented.)  But
; otherwise, we need to do an acyclicity check for the defattach events
; encountered while including a book.  The following example illustrates why
; this is necessary.  Imagine that we have two books, each containing the
; following events.

; (defstub g () t)
; (defun h () (not (g)))
; (defstub f () t)

; Now suppose one of the books concludes with the event

; (defattach f h)

; while the other concludes with the event

; (defattach g f).

; Although each book is individually certifiable, it is logically unsound to
; include both in the same session, since the resulting evaluation theory would
; equate g and h (as both are equated to f), and hence be inconsistent.  Of
; course, the extended ancestors relation in this case has a cycle: h supports
; f supports g supports h.

; Our acyclicity check will be made for the following binary relation.  Recall
; the immediate ancestors relation between a function symbol f1 introduced by
; event E1 and a function symbol f2 introduced by a later event E2: f1 occurs
; in the formula of E2.  In this case we also say that E1 is an immediate
; ancestor of E2.  For purposes of our acyclicity check, we are also interested
; in the pair <g,f> if <f,g> is an (existing, or about-to-be-introduced)
; attachment pair.  (The intuition is that ultimately we will define f to be g,
; hence f will depend on g.)  We will refer to this relation as the "extended
; immediate ancestors relation".  (Note that the discussion about events above
; refers to defun, defattach, and non-trivial encapsulate events; in
; particular, we assume that E1 and E2 are not defattach events.)

; But we really want an ancestor relation on events.  So to be more precise, we
; consider f and g to be related by either relation above if they have siblings
; f' and g' (respectively) that are so related, where two function symbols are
; siblings if they are introduced in the same (encapsulate or mutual-recursion)
; event.  We mainly ignore this issue of siblings here, but it is central in
; the Essay on Merging Attachment Records.  In that essay we also discuss in
; some detail the extended ancestor relation, which is the transitive closure
; of the union of the ordinary and extended immediate ancestor relations.  In
; particular, we defer to that essay how we check for cycles.  In summary: our
; ancestor relation is essentially on encapsulate and definitional events.
; This is important for the argument below, in which we complete our ancestor
; relation on events to a total order, essentially rearranging events so that
; for attachment pair <f,g>, g is introduced before f.  Because we want to
; rearrange entire events, our notion of event ancestor incorporates mbe when
; relevant to evaluation (i.e., in defun bodies) and guards.  We could perhaps
; avoid considering guards, actually, were it not for the issue related to
; guards raised at the end of the Essay on Correctness of Meta Reasoning.

; Before leaving the notion of extended ancestor relation, we make the
; following claim.

;   Defaxiom Acyclicity Claim.  If the extended ancestor relation is acyclic
;   without considering defaxiom events, then it remains acyclic when taking
;   the transitive closure after including defaxiom events in the following
;   sense: every event depends on every earlier defaxiom event, and every
;   defaxiom event depends on all its immediate ancestors.

; Because of this claim, we check for acyclicity of the extended ancestor
; relation, R, without considering defaxiom events, but when we assume
; acyclicity of R, we include the extra dependencies for defaxiom events
; mentioned in the claim above.  We may say "(without defaxioms" to refer to
; the version of the extended ancestor relation that does not include defaxiom
; events as above.

; To prove the claim, suppose for a contradiction that C is a cycle in the
; indicated extension for defaxiom events.  Since the extension is assumed
; acyclic before extending by defaxiom events, then C must go through an edge
; linking a defaxiom to a supporting function symbol, f.  But when we restrict
; C to start with f, we stay in the original ancestor relation, since no
; attached function is ancestral in any defaxiom, by the Defaxiom Restriction
; for Defattach (stated above).  Thus we have a cycle starting with f in the
; original ancestor relation (without extending for defaxiom events), a
; contradiction.

; We turn now to the promised logical characterization of defattach, deferring
; for several paragraphs the proof that it actually holds for admissible
; defattach events.

; The defattach events of a history extend its theory, T, to its corresponding
; "evaluation theory", T', whose axioms include T together with the attachment
; axioms: again, these are the definitions (f x1 ... xn) = (g x1 ... xn), as
; <f,g> ranges over all current attachment pairs.  We assume that the defattach
; events produce an acyclic extended ancestors relation.  A key desired
; property is as follows (see also the Evaluation History Theorem below for a
; sort of generalization).

;   Proposition (Attachment Consistency).  If a history is defaxiom-free,
;   then its evaluation theory is consistent and in fact has a standard model.

; (Note: For ACL2(r), we expect that the argument for the proposition is
; essentially unchanged except that a final step, providing a standard model,
; is of course removed.  Specifically, this proposition follows from the
; Evaluation History Theorem, as explained below, whose proof we expect goes
; through unchanged for ACL2(r).)

; What is the significance of the above proposition?  There are several
; answers, depending on our intended application of defattach.  If our
; motivation is testing, then we want to test in a model of the original
; theory; and that will be the case if we evaluate in an extension of that
; theory, which as explained in the next paragraph is the evaluation theory (as
; we evaluate f using g for each attachment pair <f,g>).  If our motivation is
; attachment to system code, then it's really the same answer: Our system code
; defines a theory of prover functions, such that every model of that theory is
; intended to be correct.  Finally, if the motivation is refinement, the idea
; is that our goal is to refine (extend) the original theory with increasingly
; strong axioms about functions; and each defattach will provide such an
; extension, so that the refinement provided by the final defattach event does
; so as well.  In all cases, the idea is that we originally specified a class
; of models, and defattach events merely shrink that class of models without
; making it empty (indeed, still including a standard model).

; We characterize the effect of defattach for evaluation in the ACL2 loop as
; follows: it takes place relative to the definitions in the current evaluation
; theory, where for each attachment pair <f,g>, the guard of f is defined to be
; the guard of g.  (Implementation note: *1*f may directly call *1*g, and f may
; directly call g, if f has attachment g.)  In particular, as with evaluation
; in the ACL2 loop in general: (a) there is never a guard violation in raw
; Lisp; and (b) if evaluation of a ground term u in the ACL2 loop returns a
; value v, then u=v is a theorem of the evaluation theory.  To see that the
; implementation guarantees this behavior, first note that for every attachment
; pair <f,g>, ACL2 insists that the guard of f logically implies the guard of
; g; hence if we replace the guard of f by the guard of g in every guard proof
; obligation, provability of the original guard proof obligation implies
; provability of this weaker, new guard proof obligation.  Another way of
; thinking about evaluation is that it takes place in the evaluation chronology
; but with the guard of f set to the guard of g; thus guard verification for
; the new definition of f (i.e., equating f with g) is trivial.

; To be more precise: The actual guard proof obligation is obtained from the
; basic one, described above, by applying the attachment substitution.  The
; argument above goes through unchanged, however, because for each attachment
; pair <f,g>, f and g are equal in the evaluation history.  In most cases we
; imagine that this remark doesn't apply, i.e., the attachment substitution
; does not hit the basic guard implications described above.  However, consider
; the case of a generic interpreter using function generic-good-statep as a
; guard, and a concrete interpreter (say, for the JVM) using function
; concrete-good-statep as a guard.  There is no reason to expect that
; generic-good-statep is stronger than (or in any way related to)
; concrete-good-statep; but the implication (implies (generic-good-statep x)
; (concrete-good-statep x)) becomes trivial when applying a functional
; substitution mapping generic-good-statep to concrete-good-statep.

; We refer below to the replacement of an encapsulate using attachment
; equations.  This refers to the process, for each function symbol being
; provided an attachment, of replacing the encapsulate with a sequence
; consisting first of attachment equations (as defun events) for each function
; f that is both attached and is introduced by the encapsulate, and then
; modifying the encapsulate by eliminating a part of it for each such symbol f
; as follows: remove f from the signature if it's present there, and otherwise
; remove the definition of f from the encapsulate.  (If the definition is via a
; sub-encapsulate, then this removal occurs recursively.)  If what is left of
; the encapsulate introduces any functions, then we apply the same argument
; showing that the constraint of the original encapsulate is provable in the
; evaluation theory, to conclude that the first pass of that encapsulate is
; provable; hence the remainder of that encapsulate is admissible in the
; evaluation chronology.

; The Attachment Consistency Proposition, above, is immediate from the
; following theorem.  Here, we say that a sequence of axiomatic events respects
; a binary relation on function symbols if whenever <f,g> is in the relation,
; the axiomatic event for f is introduced before the axiomatic event for g.

;   Theorem (Evaluation History).  Let h1 be a history, and fix legal
;   attachments for h1, that is: the extended ancestors relation is acyclic,
;   and no attached function is ancestral in any defaxiom.  Then there is a
;   permutation h2 of h1 that respects the extended dependency relation for h1.
;   Let h3 be obtained from any such h2 by replacing each attached encapsulate
;   using the attachment equations of an admissible defattach event.  Then h3
;   is a history whose theory is the evaluation theory for h1 with respect to
;   the given attachments, and whose syntactic dependency relation is the
;   extended dependency relation (without defaxioms) of h1 with respect to the
;   given attachments.

; Proof. The existence of h2 is immediate by completing the extended dependency
; relation to a total order.  So we focus on the claim that h3 is a history
; whose theory is the evaluation theory for h1.  Since h2 respects the extended
; dependency relation for h1, h3 is a weak history: roughly speaking, each
; function is introduced before it is used.  So our task is to show that all
; proof obligations are met for h3 and that its theory is the evaluation theory
; for h1 with respect to the given attachments.

; Since h2 respects the extended ancestors relation, h2 is a weak history.  To
; see that h2 is a history, it suffices to show that all proof obligations are
; met.  This is clear if there are no defaxiom events, because each initial
; segment of h2 forms a subset of (the events in) h1 that is closed under
; ancestors in h1.  The argument is similar even if there are defaxiom events,
; as follows.  Fix an event A in h2; we show that the proof obligations are met
; for A.  Let B be the predecessor of A in h2 (possibly A itself) that occurs
; latest in h1, and let let h1' be the predecessors of B (including B) in h1,
; and let h2' be the predecessors of A (including A) in h2.  It's easy to see
; that h2' is closed under ancestors in h1'; here we use the fact that h2 is
; closed under the version of the extended ancestors relation that includes
; defaxiom events (see the discussion around the Defaxiom Acyclicity Claim,
; above).  Since h1' is a history (as it is an initial segment of h1), then it
; conservatively extends h2', and thus the proof obligations are met for A as
; it sits in h2.

; We return now to the task of showing that proof obligations are met for
; events in h3.  It suffices to show that each replacement of an encapsulate by
; corresponding attachment equations, as described above, can only strengthen
; the theory.  So for E = E(f1,f2,...) an encapsulate replaced by the use of
; attachment equations A = {fi=gi}, we must show that for E' = E(g1,g2,...),
; the first pass of E' is provable from A together with the predecessors of E'
; in h3.  We induct on the length of h3, so it suffices by the inductive
; hypothesis to show that the first pass of E' is provable from A together with
; the predecessors of E in h2.  But this is obvious, since the first passes of
; E and E' are provably equal under A.

; We have shown that h3 is a history.  Clearly the theory of h3 is axiomatized
; by the theory of h1 together with the attachment equations, so the remaining
; properties of h3 are obvious. -|

; Note that since each defattach event's proof obligations are done without
; taking into account any attachment pairs outside those specified by the
; event, then we can delete any set of defattach events from the world and the
; result is still a legal set of defattach events (as acyclicity is of course
; preserved when we shrink a relation).  But we can do something else: we can
; restrict the set of attachments to any set closed under ancestors, and hence
; under that restriction we can even remove pairs within a single defattach
; event.  (As of this writing we don't support such removal, however, and
; perhaps we won't ever support it since the implementation is simpler for
; removing entire defattach events when we erase.)  A long comment in function
; chk-evaluator-use-in-rule takes advantage of this fact, which we now state
; and prove.

;   Attachment Restriction Lemma.  Let s0 be a set of attachment pairs and let
;   s1 be a subset of s0, such that every function symbol in the domain of s0
;   that is ancestral (including siblings, but ignoring defaxioms) in the
;   domain of s1 is also in the domain of s1.  Let C0 and C1 be the respective
;   lists of constraints on the domains of s0 and s1, and similarly G0 and G1
;   for guard proof obligations, and assume that the functional instances C0\s0
;   and G0\s0 are provable in the current history.  Then C1\s1 and G1\s1 are
;   also provable in the current history.

; Proof: Note that every function symbol occurring in the constraint or guard
; obligation for attaching to a function symbol, f, is ancestral in f
; (syntactically ancestral, ignoring defaxioms, as defaxioms are not considered
; when gathering such constraints; see function defattach-constraint).
; Therefore any function symbol h in the domain of s0 that occurs in C1 or G1
; is ancestral in some element of the domain of s1, and therefore h is in the
; domain of s1, by the assumption about ancestors.  It follows trivially that
; C1\s1 is a subset of C0\s0 and that G1\s1 is a subset of G0\s0.  -|

; We conclude this essay with some remarks.

; Our first implementation of defattach, in Version_4.0, went through
; considerable contortions to support what had seemed a relatively simple
; attachment for too-many-ifs-post-rewrite (then called
; too-many-ifs-post-rewrite-wrapper).  The problem was that during the first
; pass of the boot-strap, the functions pseudo-termp and pseudo-term-listp were
; in :program mode, yet were needed for the :guard of the encapsulated
; function.  Our solution was to introduce (in Version_4.2) the notion of a
; ``proxy'': a non-executable program-mode function, which can be easily
; introduced using the defproxy macro, and to add keyword argument :skip-checks
; to defattach; see :DOC defproxy.

; There are circumstances where we prohibit attachments to a constrained
; function, by associating a value (:ATTACHMENT-DISALLOWED . msg) with the
; 'attachment property of the function, where msg may be used in error
; messages.  This association enforces some restrictions on receiving
; attachments in the cases of meta functions and clause-processor functions;
; see the Essay on Correctness of Meta Reasoning.  (A different mechanism
; prohibits the functions in *unattachable-primitives* from receiving
; attachments.)

; We discuss a few aspects of how we handle this :ATTACHMENT-DISALLOWED case.
; Source function redefinition-renewal-mode disallows redefinition when there
; is an attachment, but allows redefinition in the :ATTACHMENT-DISALLOWED case.
; Thus, function renew-name/overwrite preserves the 'attachment property in
; order to preserve the prohibition of attachments; and since redefinition is
; disallowed when there is an attachment, this is actually the only case
; encountered in renew-name/overwrite for which there is a non-nil 'attachment
; property.  Finally, note that while the :ATTACHMENT-DISALLOWED case can be
; expected never to hold for a proxy, nevertheless we check this in
; redefinition-renewal-mode before attaching to a proxy.

; Essay on Merging Attachment Records

; See the Essay on Defattach for relevant background.  Our goal in this Essay
; is to describe the process whereby we check for loops in the extended
; ancestor relation and, more generally, compute that relation as a transitive
; closure.

; Let S be the siblings relation: thus S(f1,f2) holds if f1 and f2 are
; introduced in the same event.  Clearly S is an equivalence relation, and we
; will write S(f) to denote the canonical representative of that equivalence
; class, i.e., the canonical sibling of f.  A function f is canonical if S(f)
; is f.

; Recall from the Essay on Defattach that our goal is to reorder events in a
; manner that respects not only the original ancestor relation but also a new
; relation containing the ordered pair <g,f> for each attachment pair <f,g>,
; which we'll call the "immediate extended ancestor relation".  (Motivation:
; The < relation implements the use of an attachment equation in the evaluation
; chronology to define f in terms of g.)  However, for each such <g,f> added to
; that relation, we also add <g',f'> for each sibling g' of g and sibling f' of
; f.  We denote the ordinary ancestors relation as <|, which we also consider
; to respect ancestors: we include <f1',f2'> in this relation whenever f1' and
; f2' are siblings of f1 and f2 (respectively) and f1 is an ordinary ancestor
; of f2.  Finally, we define <+ as the transitive closure of the union of < and
; <|.

; The reordering argument in the Essay on Defattach provides the proof
; obligation that <+ must not contain loops.  Since f1 <+ f2 if and only if
; S(f1) <+ S(f2), we will use canonical siblings in our algorithms.  Indeed, it
; is convenient to think of all of these relations (<, <|, and <+) as being
; defined only on canonical function symbols.  Below, we denote as "f-canonical
; and "g-canonical" the function symbols S(f0) and S(g0), respectively, where
; <f0,g0> ranges over attachment pairs.

; We turn now to describe our transitive closure algorithm for computing <+.
; We create a data structure for each g-canonical function, g.  Each such g is
; associated with its canonical predecessors in each of the relations <| and <,
; and we use notation below such as "FNS" for either of these.  Then, we apply
; a "merge" operation to build up to the transitive closure.  If we encounter a
; loop, as described below, then we stop and report the loop.

; We present our algorithm using examples.  Assume that g1 initially has FNS1
; as its set of predecessors in either <| or <, and that g2 is similarly
; related to FNS2, where g1 < f1 and g2 < f2.  Thus there are attachment pairs
; <f1',g1'> and <f2',g2'> such that S(fi') = fi and S(gi') = gi; and we may
; write FNS1 <+ g1 and FNS2 <+ g2.  Now suppose f2 is in FNS1.  So we have this
; picture:

;                             FNS1 <+ g1
;                FNS2 <+ g2 < f2

; We thus associate with g1 a structure exhibiting the following path, obtained
; by merging the paths above using the attachment pair <f2,g2>.

;                FNS2 <+ g2 < f2 <+ g1

; More generally, we may or may not involve the "f field" (first component) of
; an attachment pair <f,g>.  Consider the following paths P0 and P1.

; P0:                                FNS2 <+ g2 < f2 <+ g1
; P1:   FNS4 <+ g4 <+ ... <+ x <+ g3 < f3

; We could merge using f3 if it is in FNS2, as in our previous example, or
; using g3 if it is in FNS2.  Respectively, the resulting merges of P1 into P0
; are:

;       FNS4 <+ g4 <+ ... <+ x <+ g3 < f3 <+ g2 < f2 <+ g1
;       FNS4 <+ g4 <+ ... <+ x <+ g3      <+ g2 < f2 <+ g1

; Let us call these an "f-merge" and a "g-merge", respectively, of P1 into P0.

; As an optimization, for the case FNS2 <| g2 we only allow a g-merge if P1
; consists entirely of FNS4 <+ g3 < f3.  To justify this optimization, suppose
; that P1 is as above where g4 is not g3.  We may restrict ourselves to
; constructing minimal paths.  We can thus rule out the case x <| g3, since
; otherwise we have y <+ x <| g3 <| g2, which by minimality and transitivity of
; <| implies that we have y < x <| g2.  So x is in FNS2, and we can form a path
; from FNS4 to g1 by doing an f-merge after stripping g3 from P1 (with y<x
; playing the role of g3<f3).

; In general, each such g1 is associated with a record structure that we refer
; to as an "attachment record", which includes a list of paths that is
; continually expanded by merging paths from other records into its existing
; paths.  We return later to a brief discussion of the implementation, in
; particular the relevant data structures.

; We employ a further optimization (function defattach-component-has-owner).
; Stored with each path is an "owner": the function symbol immediately
; following the initial set of functions, which we use to avoid attempting any
; merge that would be redundant in the sense that there is already a path with
; the same owner.  Consider again the merge candidate pictured above.

; P0:                                FNS2 <+ g2 < f2 <+ g1
; P1:   FNS4 <+ g4 <+ ... <+ x <+ g3 < f3

; Suppose we are considering a merge of these components, but the attachment
; record for g1 already has a component owned by g4.  Then we avoid considering
; such a merge, since the result would merely produce another <+-path from FNS4
; to g1.  (Note that we actually store both sorts of FNS4: the <-predecessors
; of g4 and the <|-predecessors of g4.)

; In particular, we never need merge two components from the same record, a
; fact we utilize in function defattach-merge-lst-lst.

; It is easy to see by induction that all paths built by this merging process
; stay inside the transitive closure (<*) of <+.  That is, our algorithm is
; sound.  For completeness, we first need a notion of "suitable" path x0 <+ x1
; <+ ... <+ xk (think of x0 as belonging to the FNS associated with x1),
; defined as follows.

; - We can write the path so that each arc joining consecutive elements is of
;   the form g < f or h <| g, where no two consecutive arcs both use <|.
; - Each element of the path is f-canonical or g-canonical.
; - The final arc in the path is of the form h < g or h <| g for some
;   g-canonical g.

; Clearly the f-merge and g-merge operations shown above preserve this notion
; of suitable path.  It is also clear that every minimal path of length at
; least 2 whose penultimate element is g-canonical is a suitable path.

; Thus, we need consider only suitable paths when forming the transitive
; closure.  We claim that after at least n full iterations of our algorithm
; (that is: attempting all possible pairwise merges at each iteration, and
; perhaps more), then every suitable path FNS <+ ... <+ g of length at most
; 2^N+1 is present.  This fact has a straightforward proof by induction on the
; length of a path, where the inductive step proceeds by dividing a path of
; length 2^N+1 into two pieces where the head of one is the tail of the other,
; one of length at most 2^(N-1) and the other of length at most 2^(N-1)+1.

; The argument above shows that in fact, the attachment record for every
; g-canonical g includes every <+-ancestor of g (again, considering only
; canonical function symbols), either as a member of the set FNS defined by FNS
; <| g' for some g-canonical g' <+ g, or else as such a g' (the owner of the a
; component's path for ordinary ancestor set FNS).

; As we compute the transitive closure, we look for loops.  Where do we look?
; First observe that if there is a loop, then the loop involves at least one
; use of <; so there is a loop connecting g to itself for some g-canonical g.
; By the argument above we know that we will at some point construct a path
; from g; thus g is in FNS where we have constructed FNS <+ h <+ ... g.  When
; that occurs, we report the loop.

; (Remark.  Notice that we are building up the set of extended ancestors of g
; in a manner that lets us report any loop that is found.  We may be able to
; change our algorithm to compute this set more efficiently by unioning all the
; FNS found into a single FNS for the entire attachment record, running the
; original algorithm only if a loop is detected; but that can wait.  The
; current approach may have the advantage that less needs to be thrown away
; when we erase, as with (defattach f nil).  End of remark.)

; Let's explore further how this works at the implementation level.

; Attachment records have the following fields, where we write x++y to denote
; the result of appending y to x unless x or y is a symbol, in which case it is
; treated as a list containing just that symbol.  For example, if x is (f1 f2)
; and y is either (f3) or f3, then x++y is (f1 f2 f3).

; - g
;   where g is g-canonical
; - ext-succ
;   (immediate) canonical successors of g in <
; - components
;   A list of components, each of which is an attachment-component record
;   having the following fields:
;     - path
;       a list of function symbols such that each element has relation < or <|
;       to the next
;     - ext-anc, ord-anc
;       the set of predecessors under < (respectively, <|) of the first element
;       of path++g; thus if path is empty then g else the first element of
;       path.  Note that we collect here only canonical function symbols.
; - pairs
;   list of all attachment pairs <f0,g0> such that S(g0) = g; thus, the
;   :ext-succ field is the set of S(f0) for all <f0,g0> in the :pairs field

; Note that the pairs field is used only by the code that erases attachment
; pairs, not by the code that merges paths.

; The notion of owner, introduced above, is realized in the following
; definition.

(defun attachment-component-owner (g path)

; Return the owner of an attachment-component, with :path field of path, that
; is in the :components field of an attachment record with :g field of g.

  (if path (car path) g))

; The initial attachment record for a given g has a unique component, with
; owner g and empty path, and whose ext-anc field (denoted fns<g) and ord-anc
; field (denoted fns<|g) are, respectively, the set of all immediate extended
; ancestors (i.e., <-predecessors) and of ordinary ancestors (i.e.,
; <|-predecessors) of g.  We maintain the invariant that this component is
; always the last one in the list of components of an attachment record.

; We can now build our algorithm from the bottom up.  The fundamental operation
; is (defattach-merge r1 r2), which merges r2 into r1 if there is such a merge.
; Function defattach-merge-lst takes a record r1 and list lst of records, and
; repeatedly merges the elements of lst into r1.  Function
; defattach-merge-lst-lst is called on a list of records and merges each record
; into each other record in the list.

; But we might find a cycle.  The above functions typically return (mv flg
; result), where: flg = nil if there has been no merging, in which case result
; is irrelevant; flg = 'loop if there has been merging, in which case result is
; the representation of a loop; or flg = t, in which case there has been
; merging but there is no loop.

; We attempt a merge into some component of a record, R0, from a component of
; another record, R1.  The following picture illustrates the situation using
; parameter names from this function and local variables introduced in the code
; below, while omitting unneeded fields.

; R0:
; [:g g0
;  :ext-succ ext-succ0
;  :comps
;  (   ...
;      [:ord-anc ord-anc0
;       :ext-anc ext-anc0

;      [:ord-anc ord-anc1
;       :ext-anc ext-anc1
;       :path path1 ; nil
;      ...)

; First consider the f-merge case.  From R0 and R1 we have the following paths,
; where each anci is either ord-anci or ext-anci.

;                       anc0 <+ h0 <+ ... <+ g0
;   anc1 <+ ... <+ g1 < ext-succ1

; For an f-merge we need ext-succ1 and anc0 to intersect; suppose we find h in
; their intersection.  The resulting component then has this path:

;   anc1 <+ ... <+ g1 < h <+ h0 <+ ... <+ g0

; For the g-merge case we require either the use of ext-anc0 for anc0, or else
; that path1 = nil.  Then we can consider the following picture.

;                anc0 <+ h0 <+ ... <+ g0
;   anc1 <+ ... <+ g1

; We can merge if g1 is in anc0, obtaining:

;   anc1 <+ ... <+ g1 <+ h0 <+ ... <+ g0

; Suppose that the merge succeeds.  If g0 is in anc1, then we have a loop.  We
; also have a loop if ext-succ0 intersects anc1, say at h1:

;    h1  <+ ... <+ g1 <+ h0 <+ ... <+ g0 < h1

; If h1 is not iself g-canonical, then will not find the merge below at a later
; step, because it requires merging two components both attached to the same
; record (with :g field g0), which we avoid for efficiency.

;      anc1 <+ ... <+ ... <+ g0
;  g0 < h1

; So we look for these loops, too.

; Since our goal is to produce a <+ path from the owner of the supplied
; component of R1 up to g0, we stop when we find a merge, in which case we
; return (mv nil comp) where comp is the new component for R0.

  Please first ~pl[return-last] for relevant background.

  This ~il[table] is for advanced users only, and requires an active trust
  tag (~pl[defttag]).  We recommend that you do not modify this table directly,
  but instead use the macro ~c[defmacro-last].  Here we augment that discussion
  with some highly technical observations that can probably be ignored if you
  use ~c[defmacro-last].~/

  This ~il[table] has a ~c[:guard] requiring that each key be a symbol defined
  in raw Lisp, generally as a macro, and requiring that each non-~c[nil] value
  be associated either with a symbol that names a macro defined in ACL2, or
  else with a list of one element containing such a symbol.  The table can only
  be modified when there is an active trust tag; ~pl[defttag].  If a key is
  associated with the value ~c[nil], then that key is treated as though it were
  not in the table.

  Note that keys of this table are not eligible to be bound by ~ilc[flet].  The
  current value of this table may be obtained by evaluating the form
  ~c[(table-alist 'return-last-table (w state))].  The built-in constant
  ~c[*initial-return-last-table*] holds the initial value of this table.~/")

  printing to strings instead of files or standard output~/

  Each of ACL2's formatted printing functions, ~c[FM*], has an analoguous macro
  ~c[FM*-TO-STRING] indicated below.  These functions do not include a channel
  or ~ilc[state] as an argument, and ~c[FM*-TO-STRING] returns the string that
  ~c[FM*] would print to the state, in place of ~c[state]; ~pl[fmt].  The legal
  keyword arguments are described below.

  ~bv[]
  General Forms:                                 result
  (fms-to-string string alist &key ...)          ; string
  (fmt-to-string string alist &key ...)          ; (mv col string)
  (fmt1-to-string string alist column &key ...)  ; (mv col string)
  (fms!-to-string string alist &key ...)         ; string
  (fmt!-to-string string alist &key ...)         ; (mv col string)
  (fmt1!-to-string string alist column &key ...) ; (mv col string)
  ~ev[]

  The legal keyword arguments are as follows.  They are all optional with a
  default of ~c[nil].
  ~bq[]
  ~c[Evisc-tuple] is evaluated, and corresponds exactly to the ~c[evisc-tuple]
  argument of the corresponding ~c[FM*] function; ~pl[fmt].

  ~c[Fmt-control-alist] should typically evaluate to an alist that maps
  print-control variables to values; ~pl[print-control].  Any alist mapping
  variables to values is legal, however.  By default the print controls are set
  according to the value of constant ~c[*fmt-control-defaults*];
  ~c[fmt-control-alist] overrides these defaults.  For example,
  ~c[*fmt-control-defaults*] sets the right margin just as it is set in the
  initial ACL2 ~il[state], by binding ~c[fmt-soft-right-margin] and
  ~c[fmt-hard-right-margin] to their respective defaults of
  ~c[*fmt-soft-right-margin-default*] and ~c[*fmt-hard-right-margin-default*].
  The following example shows how you can override those defaults, in this case
  arranging to print flat by setting the right margin to a large number.

  ":Doc-Section Other

  using proof supporters to identify dead code and unused theorems~/

  Below, when we talk about ``an event ~c[A]'', we mean an event whose name is
  ~c[A].

  When event ~c[A] is used in a proof performed to admit event ~c[B] that you
  submit to ACL2, we say that ~c[A] is a ``proof-supporter'' of ~c[B].  ACL2
  stores an association list such that for every event ~c[B] with at least one
  proof-supporter, ~c[B] is associated with a list of all of its
  proof-supporters, sorted by ~ilc[symbol-<].  The following form evaluates to
  that alist, which is called the ``proof-supporters-alist''.
  ~bv[]
  (global-val 'proof-supporters-alist (w state))
  ~ev[]
  By ``used in a proof'' above, we mean: applied as a rule or supplied
  explicitly via ~il[hints] of type ~c[:use], ~c[:by], or
  ~c[:clause-processor].  That is, the ~il[events] ``used in a proof'' for
  admitting an event ~c[E] are those listed in the summary printed at the
  conclusion of admitting ~c[E].~/

  Note that if proofs are skipped when admitting event ~c[E], say because the
  last admission of ~c[E] was done by ~ilc[include-book] (or ~c[certify-book],
  which ends with an ~ilc[include-book]), then there will be no entry in that
  alist for ~c[E].  (An exception is made however for ~ilc[encapsulate]
  ~il[events], where proof-supporters are remembered from the first pass; see
  below.)  So if you want the proof-supporters-alist to include supporters for
  events in a book, use ~ilc[ld] rather than ~ilc[include-book] or
  ~ilc[certify-book] to process the events in that book.  If however you are
  interested in the proof-supporters FROM a book that support a later event,
  then it is fine to include that book.

  The case for ~ilc[encapsulate] is slightly tricky.  Consider an example of
  the following form.
  ~bv[]
  A ; event preceding the encapsulate
  (encapsulate
   ()
   B
   (local C) ; uses A and B in a proof
   D ; uses C in a proof
   )
  ~ev[]
  At the conclusion of this ~ilc[encapsulate] event, the proof-supporters-alist
  associates ~c[D] with ~c[A] and ~c[B], but not ~c[C] (which has disappeared,
  since it is ~il[local]).

  Note that this sort of ``transitive closure'' operation is only performed
  when necessary due to the disappearance of ~il[local] ~il[events].  For
  example, if we replace ~c[(local C)] above by just ~c[C], then ~c[D] is
  associated in the proof-supporters-alist only with ~c[C], not with ~c[A] or
  ~c[B].  If you want the transitive closure of the relation computed by the
  proof-supporters-alist, you have to compute it yourself. (This was a
  deliberate design decision, in order to avoid slowing down event processing.)
  However, there is help available on how to do such a computation:

  A community book, ~c[books/misc/dead-events.lisp], does such a transitive
  closure, and moreover uses that information to find ``dead events'' relative
  to a list of ``desired'' events.  For example, suppose you use ~ilc[LD] to
  process the events, with proofs, in a book intended to prove theorems
  ~c[MAIN-1] and ~c[MAIN-2].  (Remember, ~ilc[certify-book] will not save such
  information.)  Suppose furthermore that the book begins with some
  ~ilc[include-book] forms followed by ~c[(deflabel book-start)].  You could
  evaluate this form:
  ~bv[]
  (dead-events '(main-1 main-2) :start 'book-start)
  ~ev[]
  The result is a list of events that you probably can delete from the book
  without causing any proofs to fail.  See the ~c[dead-events.lisp] book for
  further documentation.

  You might also find the code in the above book to be helpful for writing your
  own utilities based on the proof-supporters-alist.~/")

; Essay on Memoization with Attachments (relevant for #+hons version only)

; We maintain the invariant that every stored value in a memo table is valid.

; The main idea is to ensure that if a function m is memoized with :aok t, then
; for every possible call of m, every function called has the same attachment
; now as it did when the value was stored.  To do this, we maintain a stronger
; invariant, described in the next paragraph, that is based on the acyclic
; "extended ancestor" relation introduced in the the Essay on Defattach.
; Roughly speaking, this relation is the transitive closure of the immediate
; ancestor relation, where g is an immediate ancestor of f if it either g is an
; ordinary ancestor of f or else <f,g> is an attachment pair (think: f is
; redefined to be g).  We say "roughly speaking" primarily because we traffic
; entirely in "canonical" function symbols, as explained in the Essay on
; Defattach.  Morover, for our defattach implementation, we include guards in
; the calculation of canonical ancestors.  Guards are relevant in the sense
; that changing or (especially) removing an attachment used in a guard could
; invalidate a stored value, not logically, but in the sense that its
; computation should now cause a guard violation error and thus we don't want
; to return such a value.

; Let m a memoized function symbol.  If m was memoized with :aok nil (the
; default), then the invariant maintained is simply that the
; :ext-anc-attachments field of the memoize-info-ht-entry record for m is nil.
; This implies the property we desire, that all stored entries for m are valid,
; because defattach events do not destroy the validity of stored results.  But
; in the case that f was memoized with :aok t, the :ext-anc-attachments field
; of the memoize-info-ht-entry record for m is a non-null fast alist whose keys
; are exactly the (canonical) extended ancestors of m, including the canonical
; sibling of m.  We maintain the invariant that the value of key f in this fast
; alist is itself an alist associating each sibling f' of f with its
; attachment, for each sibling f' that has an attachment.

; To summarize: in the :aok t case, we maintain the :ext-anc-attachments field
; to have the value described above, and every value stored in the memo table
; is correct with respect to the current attachments, which are those indicated
; in the :ext-anc-attachments field.  Thus, if a defattach event changes the
; attachment of (some sibling of) an extended ancestor, then the
; :ext-anc-attachments field is recalculated and stored anew.  If the only
; changes are to add new attachments, without changing or removing any existing
; attachments, then the memo table is not cleared; otherwise, it is.  The
; analogous actions are taken when we undo.

; For efficiency, we implement extend-world1, retract-world1, and recover-world
; so that they do not update such fields or clear memo-tables until all trips
; have been processed.  At that point we see whether any defattach event has
; been installed or undone, and then we see whether any memo-table's
; :ext-anc-attachments field needs to be recalculated, and whether furthermore
; the table needs to be invalidated, as discussed above.  For efficiency, we
; set a variable to a list L of canonical siblings of all functions whose
; attachment may have been installed, eliminated, or changed.  We then restrict
; our check on :ext-anc-attachments fields to check attachments for siblings of
; functions in L.  In particular, if L is empty then nothing needs to be done.

;;; Going backward, when we see that an extended ancestor attachment has
;;; changed or been added for the memo table of fn, then add fn to a list of
;;; functions that will eventually have their memo tables strongly cleared when
;;; we finish retract-world1.  (How about recover-world?  Perhaps just strongly
;;; clear all memo tables unless I find a better idea.)

  ":Doc-Section acl2::Events

  define a potentially inlined function symbol and associated macro~/

  You may be able to improve performance by replacing an event
  ~c[(defun f ...)] with a corresponding event ~c[(defun-inline f ...)], in
  order to encourage the host Lisp compiler to inline calls of ~c[f].

  ~bv[]
  Example Form:
  (defun-inline lng (x)
    (declare (xargs :guard (true-listp x)))
    (if (endp x) 0 (1+ (lng (cdr x)))))~/

  General Form:
  (defun-inline fn (var1 ... varn) doc-string dcl ... dcl body)
  ~ev[]
  satisfying the same requirements as in the General Form for ~ilc[defun].  The
  effect is to define a macro ~c[fn] and a function ~c[fn$inline] (i.e., a
  symbol in the same package as ~c[fn] but whose ~ilc[symbol-name] has the
  suffix ~c[\"$INLINE\"], such that each call of ~c[fn] expands to a call of
  the function symbol ~c[fn$inline] on the same arguments.  If ~c[doc-string]
  is supplied, then it is associated with ~c[fn], not with ~c[fn$inline].
  Moreover, ~ilc[table] ~il[events] are generated that allow the use of ~c[fn]
  in ~il[theory] expressions to represent ~c[fn$inline] and that cause any
  untranslated (user-level) call of ~c[fn$inline] to be printed as the
  corresponding call of ~c[fn].

  A form ~c[(defun-inline f ...)] actually defines a function named
  ~c[f$inline] and a corresponding macro named ~c[f] whose calls expand to
  calls of ~c[f$inline], while providing the illusion that there is just the
  ``function'' ~c[f].  For example, the Example Form above macroexpands in one
  step to the following form.
  ~bv[]
  (progn (defmacro lng (non-stobj-var0)
           (list 'lng$inline non-stobj-var0))
         (add-macro-fn lng lng$inline)
         (defun lng$inline (x)
           (declare (xargs :guard (true-listp x)))
           (if (endp x) 0 (1+ (lng (cdr x))))))
  ~ev[]
  Note that the above call of ~ilc[add-macro-fn] generates the aforementioned
  two table events (~pl[add-macro-fn]), which provide the illusion that we are
  just defining a function ~c[lng], as you can see in the following log:
  ~c[lng] appears rather than ~c[lng$inline].
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>(set-gag-mode nil)

  Under the hood, ACL2 arranges that every function symbol with suffix
  ~c[\"$INLINE\"] is presented to the compiler as one whose calls we would
  prefer to inline.  Technically: the Common Lisp form
  ~c[(declaim (inline f$inline))] is generated for a function symbol
  ~c[f$inline] before that symbol's definition is submitted.  However, the
  Common Lisp spec explicitly avoids requiring that the compiler respect this
  ~c[declaim] form.  Fortunately, Common Lisp implementations often do respect
  it.

  Also ~pl[defund-inline], ~pl[defun-notinline], and ~pl[defund-notinline].

  ~em[Remarks].

  (1) None of these macros (including ~c[defun-inline]) is supported for use
  inside a ~ilc[mutual-recursion].

  (2) Every function symbol defined in ACL2 whose ~ilc[symbol-name] has the
  suffix ~c[\"$INLINE\"] is proclaimed to be inline; similarly for
  ~c[\"$NOTINLINE\"] and notinline.

  (3) No special treatment for inlining (or notinlining) is given for function
  symbols locally defined by ~ilc[flet], with two exceptions: when explicitly
  declared ~c[inline] or ~c[notinline] by the ~c[flet] form, and for symbols
  discussed in (1) and (2) above that, at some point in the current ACL2
  session, were defined as function symbols in ACL2 (even if not currently
  defined because of undoing or being ~il[local]).

  (4) The function symbol actually being defined by ~c[(defun-inline foo ...)]
  is ~c[foo$inline].  As mentioned above, one can be oblivious to this fact
  when writing ~il[theory] expressions or perusing prover output.  However, for
  other purposes (for example, ~ilc[verify-guards] and ~ilc[defabsstobj]
  ~c[:exports]) you will need to supply the name of the function symbol rather
  than the name of the macro; e.g., for the above form
  ~c[(defun-inline foo ...)], you may subsequently issue the event
  ~c[(verify-guards foo$inline)] but not ~c[(verify-guards foo)].

  (5) Obscure Remark.  Suppose that you certify a book with compilation (the
  default) in one host Lisp, saving the expansion file.  Suppose that you then
  compile in another host Lisp by using ~ilc[include-book] with argument
  ~c[:load-compiled-file :comp].  Then in subsequent sessions, including that
  book with the second host Lisp will not result in any inline or notinline
  behavior for functions defined in the book.  This may be fixed in a future
  release if someone complains.~/"

; Implementor hint for (5) above: Search for ";;; Declaim forms:" in
; write-expansion-file, and notice the printing just below it of a readtime
; conditional for the host Lisp, so that declaim forms are restricted to that
; Lisp.  This mechanism was probably put into place so that declaiming for GCL
; didn't result in declaiming for Allegro CL, or something along those lines.

; Essay on Regenerate-tau-database

; Regenerate-tau-database is motivated by the desire to provide the user with
; some facility for adjusting the tau database to reflect a theory, since
; otherwise there would be no way to achieve that end short of removing certain
; theorems from the script!  We think this will be a rarely-used event simply
; because tau is designed to prove goals, not to simplify or rewrite them.  How
; often will the user wish a goal NOT to be proved?  This is an admittedly
; naive view of the situation, since as of this writing no one has ever used
; the tau system!  It is still being developed.

; Regenerate-tau-database recomputes the database but only considers those
; runes enabled by the current global theory.  But this represents a design
; choice: why not allow the user to specify the theory governing the
; regeneration process?  For example, why not provide:

; (regenerate-tau-database (disable lemma55))

; We call this the ``tau theory alternative'' and rejected it because we think
; it will confuse the user moving forward.  That is, while a particular tau
; theory might be used to regenerate the database when the regeneration event
; is processed, the subsequent incremental extension of the database with
; :tau-system or implicit (auto mode) rules is done under the global theory.
; This could be confusing if the user thinks that the tau theory governs what
; is in the tau database (instead of what was put in it ``initially'' by the
; regeneration event).

; One solution would be to provide a completely separate theory to be used by
; tau.  Setting the tau theory to some new theory would actually recompute the
; tau database.  As new events are added, both the current theory and the tau
; theory are explicitly extended.  All queries to enabled status by the tau
; system, including its use of type-set, would refer to the tau theory.  In a
; situation similar to in-arithmetic-theory we would either have to provide
; versions of enable and disable that are relative to current-tau-theory or
; else warn the user not to use those macros.  All things considered this seems
; like a lot of infrastructure for a rarely used event.

; The design we actually implement doesn't allow for a distinct tau theory.
; The global theory is always used.  If the user wants to regenerate the
; database he or she must reset the global theory appropriately and set it back
; afterwards.  This has the advantage of forcing the user to acknowledge which
; theory is being used.

; In a similar vein, we use the global (acl2-defaults-table) setting of
; tau-auto-modep during the regeneration.

  ":Doc-Section acl2::Events

  define a function symbol and then disable it~/~/

  Use ~c[defund] instead of ~ilc[defun] when you want to disable a function
  immediately after its definition in ~c[:]~ilc[logic] mode.  This macro has
  been provided for users who prefer working in a mode where functions are only
  enabled when explicitly directed by ~c[:]~ilc[in-theory].  Specifically, the
  form
  ~bv[]
  (defund NAME FORMALS ...)
  ~ev[]
  expands to:
  ~bv[]
  (progn
    (defun NAME FORMALS ...)
    (with-output
     :off summary
     (in-theory (disable NAME)))
    (value-triple '(:defund NAME))).
  ~ev[]
  Only the ~c[:]~ilc[definition] rule (and, for recursively defined functions,
  the ~c[:]~ilc[induction] rule) for the function are disabled.  In particular,
  ~c[defund] does not disable either the ~c[:]~ilc[type-prescription] or the
  ~c[:]~ilc[executable-counterpart] rule.  Also, the summary for the
  ~ilc[in-theory] event is suppressed.

  If the function is defined in ~c[:]~ilc[program] mode, either because the
  ~il[default-defun-mode] is ~c[:]~ilc[program] or because ~c[:mode :program]
  has been specified in an ~ilc[xargs] form of a ~ilc[declare] form, then no
  ~ilc[in-theory] event is executed.  (More precisely, ~ilc[in-theory] events
  are ignored when the ~il[default-defun-mode] is ~c[:]~ilc[program], and if
  ~c[:mode :program] is specified then ~c[defund] does not generate an
  ~ilc[in-theory] event.)

  Note that ~c[defund] commands are never redundant (~pl[redundant-events])
  when the ~il[default-defun-mode] is ~c[:]~ilc[logic], because the
  ~ilc[in-theory] event will always be executed.
