; We use a single hash table to restore both function and macro definitions.
; In v4-0 and v4-1 we had separate hash tables for these, but after a bug
; report from Jared Davis that amounted to a CCL issue (error upon redefining a
; macro as a function), we discovered an ACL2 issue, which we now describe
; using an example.

; In our example, the file fn.lisp has the definition
;   (defun f (x)
;     (declare (xargs :guard t))
;     (cons x x))
; while the file mac.lisp has this:
;   (defmacro f (x)
;     x)

; After certifying both books in v4-1, the following sequence of events then
; causes the error shown below in v4-1, as does the sequence obtained by
; switching the order of the include-book forms.  The problem in both cases is
; a failure to restore properly the original definition of f after the failed
; include-book.

; (include-book "fn")
; (include-book "mac") ; fails, as expected (redefinition error)
; (defun g (x)
;   (declare (xargs :guard t))
;   (f x))
; (g 3) ; "Error:  The function F is undefined."

; By using a single hash table (in functions hcomp-init and hcomp-restore-defs)
; we avoid this problem.

; Warning: If you are tempted to bind safe-mode to nil outside the boot-strap,
; then revisit the binding of *safe-mode-verified-p* to t in the
; #-acl2-loop-only definition of defconst.  See the defparameter for
; *safe-mode-verified-p*.

; Why do we need to bind safe-mode to t?  An important reason is that we will
; be loading compiled files corresponding to certified books, where defconst
; forms will be evaluated in raw Lisp.  By using safe-mode, we can guarantee
; that these evaluations were free of guard violations when certifying the
; book, and hence will be free of guard violations when loading such compiled
; files.

; But even before we started loading compiled files before processing
; include-book events (i.e., up through Version_3.6.1), safe-mode played an
; important role.  The following legacy comment explains:

; Otherwise [without safe-mode bound to t], if we certify book char-bug-sub
; with a GCL image then we can certify char-bug with an Allegro image, thus
; proving nil.  The problem is that f1 is not properly guarded, yet we go
; directly into the raw Lisp version of f1 when evaluating the defconst.  That
; is just the sort of problem that safe-mode prevents.  See also :doc
; note-2-9-3 for another example, and see the comment about safe-mode related
; to redundancy of a :program mode defun with a previous :logic mode defun, in
; redundant-or-reclassifying-defunp.  And before deciding to remove safe-mode
; here, consider an example like this:

; (defun foo () (declare (xargs :mode :program)) (mbe :logic t :exec nil))
; (defconst *a* (foo))
; ... followed by a theorem about *a*.  If *a* is proved nil, that could
; conflict with a theorem that *a* is t proved after (verify-termination foo).

; Anyhow, here is the char-bug-sub example mentioned above.

; ;;; char-bug-sub.lisp

; (in-package "ACL2")
;
; (defun f1 ()
;   (declare (xargs :mode :program))

; The following comment is no longer relevant, because the #-acl2-loop-only
; code above for the boot-strap case allows us to assume here that
; (f-get-global 'boot-strap-flg state) is nil.

;   However, it is not practical to bind safe-mode to t during the boot-strap
;   with user::*fast-acl2-gcl-build*, because we have not yet compiled the *1*
;   functions (see add-trip).  For the sake of uniformity, we go ahead and

; This "-msg" function supports the community book books/misc/defmac.lisp.

; Any modification to this function and its subordinates must cause
; one to reflect on the two function nests bind-macro-args...  and
; macro-vars... because they assume the presence of the structure that
; this function checks for.  See the comment before macro-vars for the
; restrictions we impose on macros.

; The subordinates of this function do not check that symbols that
; occur in binding spots are non-keywords and non-constants and
; without duplicates.  That check is performed here, with chk-arglist,
; as a final pass.

; Important Note:  If ever we change this function so that instead of
; just checking the args it "translates" the args, so that it returns
; the translated form of a proper arglist, then we must visit a similar
; change on the function primordial-event-macro-and-fn, which currently
; assumes that if a defmacro will be processed without error then
; the macro-args are exactly as presented in the defmacro.

; The idea of translating macro args is not ludicrous.  For example,
; the init-forms in keyword parameters must be quoted right now.  We might
; want to allow naked numbers or strings or t or nil.  But then we'd
; better go look at primordial-event-macro-and-fn.

; It is very suspicious to think about allowing the init forms to be
; anything but quoted constants because Common Lisp is very vague about
; when you get the bindings for free variables in such expressions
; or when such forms are evaluated.

; The following functions support boot-strapping.  Consider what

; Suppose it is (defconst nil 'nil).  It is translated wrt the
; initial world.  Unless 'defconst has a macro definition in that
; initial world, we won't get off the ground.  The same remark holds
; for the other primitive event functions encountered in axioms.lisp.
; Therefore, before we first call translate we have got to construct a
; world with certain properties already set.

; We compute those properties with the functions below, from the
; following constant.  This constant must be the quoted form of the
; event defmacros found in axioms.lisp!  It was obtained by
; going to the axioms.lisp buffer, grabbing all of the text in the
; "The *initial-event-defmacros* Discussion", moving it over here,
; embedding it in "(defconst *initial-event-defmacros* '(&))" and
; then deleting the #+acl2-loop-only commands, comments, and documentation

; This function is the standard place to initialize a world global.
; Among the effects of this function is to set the global variable
; 'world-globals to the list of all variables initialized.  Thus,
; it is very helpful to follow the discipline of initializing all
; globals here, whether their initial values are important or not.

; Historical Note: Once upon a time, before we kept a stack of
; properties on the property lists representing installed worlds, it
; was necessary, when retracting from a world, to scan the newly
; exposed world to find the new current value of any property removed.
; This included the values of world globals and it often sent us all
; the way back to the beginning of the primordial world.  We then
; patched things up by using this collection of names at the end of
; system initialization to "float" to the then-top of the world the
; values of all world globals.  That was the true motivation of
; collecting the initialization of all globals into one function: so
; we could get 'world-globals so we knew who to float.

; We now start the development of deftheory and theory expressions.

; First, please read the Essay on Enabling, Enabled Structures, and
; Theories for a refresher course on such things as runes, common
; theories, and runic theories.  Roughly speaking, theory expressions
; are terms that produce common theories as their results.  Recall
; that a common theory is a truelist of rule name designators.  A rule
; name designator is an object standing for a set of runes; examples
; include APP, which might stand for {(:DEFINITION app)}, (APP), which
; might stand for {(:EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART app)}, and LEMMA1, which
; might stand for the set of runes {(REWRITE lemma1 . 1) (REWRITE
; lemma1 . 2) (ELIM lemma1)}.  Of course, a rune is a rule name designator
; and stands for the obvious: the singleton set containing that rune.

; To every common theory there corresponds a runic theory, obtained
; from the common theory by unioning together the designated sets of
; runes and then ordering the result by nume.  Runic theories are
; easier to manipulate (e.g., union together) because they are
; ordered.

; To define deftheory we need not define any any "theory manipulation
; functions" (e.g., union-theories, or universal-theory) because
; deftheory just does a full-blown eval of whatever expression the
; user provides.  We could therefore define deftheory now.  But there
; are a lot of useful theory manipulation functions and they are
; generally used only in deftheory and in-theory, so we define them
; now.

; Calls of these functions will be typed by the user in theory
; expressions.  Those expressions will be executed to obtain new
; theories.  Furthermore, the user may well define his own theory
; producing functions which will be mixed in with ours in his
; expressions.  How do we know a "theory expression" will produce a
; theory?  We don't.  We just evaluate it and check the result.  But
; this raises a more serious question: how do we know our theory
; manipulation functions are given theories as their arguments?
; Indeed, they may not be given theories because of misspellings, bugs
; in the user's functions, etc.  Because of the presence of
; user-defined functions in theory expressions we can't syntactically
; check that an expression is ok.  And at the moment we don't see that
; it is worth the trouble of making the user prove "theory theorems"
; such as (THEORYP A W) -> (THEORYP (MY-FN A) W) that would let us so
; analyze his expressions.

; So we have decided to put run-time checks into our theory functions.
; We have two methods available to us: we could put guards on them or
; we could put checks into them.  The latter course does not permit us
; to abort on undesired arguments -- because we don't want theory
; functions to take STATE and be multi-valued.  Thus, once past the
; guards all we can do is coerce unwanted args into acceptable ones.

; There are several sources of tension.  It was such tensions that
; led to the idea of "common" v. "runic" theories and, one level deeper,
; "rule name designators" v. runes.

; (1) When our theory functions are getting input directly from the
;     user we wish they did a thorough job of checking it and were
;     forgiving about such things as order, e.g., sorted otherwise ok
;     lists, so that the user didn't need to worry about order.

; (2) When our theory functions are getting input produced by one of
;     our functions, we wish they didn't check anything so they could
;     just fly.

; (3) These functions have to be admissible under the definitional principle
;     and not cause errors when called on the utter garbage that the user
;     might type.

; (4) Checking the well-formedness of a theory value requires access to
;     wrld.

; We have therefore chosen the following strategy.

; First, all theory manipulation functions take wrld as an argument.
; Some need it, e.g., the function that returns all the available rule
; names.  Others wouldn't need it if we made certain choices on the
; handling of run-time checks.  We've chosen to be uniform: all have
; it.  This uniformity saves the user from having to remember which
; functions do and which don't.

; Second, all theory functions have guards that check that their
; "theory" arguments "common theories."  This means that if a theory
; function is called on utter garbage the user will get an error
; message.  But it means we'll pay the price of scanning each theory
; value on each function entry in his expression to check
; rule-name-designatorp.

; To compute on theories we will convert common theories to runic ones
; (actually, all the way to augmented runic theories) and we will
; always return runic theories because they can be verified faster.
; This causes a second scan every time but in general will not go into
; sorting because our intermediate results will always be ordered.
; This gives us "user-friendliness" for top-level calls of the theory
; functions without (too much?)  overhead.

; Now we define union, intersect, and set-difference for lists of rule
; names.

(defun theory-fn-callp (x)

; We return t or nil.  If t, and the evaluation of x does not cause an error,
; then the result is a runic-theoryp.  Here x is an untranslated term; see also
; theory-fn-translated-callp for translated terms x.  It would be sound to
; return non-nil here if theory-fn-translated-callp returns non-nil, but that
; doesn't seem useful for user-level terms (though we may want to reconsider).

; Essay on Theory Manipulation Performance

; Below we show some statistics on our theory manipulation functions.
; These are recorded in case we someday change these functions and
; wish to compare the old and new implementations.  The expressions
; shown should be executed in raw lisp, not LP, because they involve
; the time function.  These expressions were executed in a newly
; initialized ACL2.  The times are on a Sparc 2 (Rana).

; The following expression is intended as a "typical" heavy duty
; theory expression.  For the record, the universal theory at the time
; of these tests contained 1307 runes.

; (let ((world (w *the-live-state*)))
;   (time
;    (length
;     (union-theories
;      (intersection-theories (current-theory :here)
;                             (executable-counterpart-theory :here))
;      (set-difference-theories (universal-theory :here)
;                               (function-theory :here))))))

; Repeated runs were done.  Typical results were:
;   real time : 0.350 secs
;   run time  : 0.233 secs
;   993

; The use of :here above meant that all the theory functions involved
; just looked up their answers in the 'standard-theories at
; the front of the initialized world.  The following expression forces
; the exploration of the whole world.  In the test, "ACL2-USER" was
; the event printed by :pc -1, i.e., the last event before ending the
; boot.

; (let ((world (w *the-live-state*)))
;   (time
;    (length
;     (union-theories
;      (intersection-theories (current-theory "ACL2-USER")
;                             (executable-counterpart-theory "ACL2-USER"))
;      (set-difference-theories (universal-theory "ACL2-USER")
;                               (function-theory "ACL2-USER"))))))

; Repeated tests produced the following typical results.
;   real time : 0.483 secs
;   run time  : 0.383 secs
;   993
; The first run, however, had a real time of almost 10 seconds because
; wrld had to be paged in.

; The final test stresses sorting.  We return to the :here usage to
; get our theories, but we reverse the output every chance we get so
; as force the next theory function to sort.  In addition, we
; strip-cadrs all the input runic theories to force the reconstruction
; of runic theories from the wrld.

; (let ((world (w *the-live-state*)))
;   (time
;    (length
;     (union-theories
;      (reverse
;       (intersection-theories
;         (reverse (strip-base-symbols (current-theory :here)))
;         (reverse (strip-base-symbols (executable-counterpart-theory :here)))))
;      (reverse
;       (set-difference-theories
;         (reverse (strip-base-symbols (universal-theory :here)))
;         (reverse (strip-base-symbols (function-theory :here)))))))))

; Typical times were
;   real time : 1.383 secs
;   run time  : 0.667 secs
;   411
; The size of the result is smaller because the strip-cadrs identifies
; several runes, e.g., (:DEFINITION fn) and (:EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART
; fn) both become fn which is then understood as (:DEFINITION fn).

; Historical Note:  Once upon a time deftheory-fn did not exist even
; though deftheory did.  We defined deftheory as a macro which expanded
; into a defconstant-fn expression.  In particular,

; (deftheory *a* (union *b* (universe w)))

; was mapped to

; (er-let* ((lst (translate-in-theory-hint
;                   '(union *b* (universe w))
;                   nil
;                   '(deftheory . *a*)
;                   (w state)
;                   state)))
;          (defconstant-fn '*a*
;            (list 'quote lst)
;            state
;            nil))

; Thus, the "semantics" of a successful execution of deftheory was that of
; defconstant.  This suffered from letting theories creep into formulas.  For
; example, one could later write in a proposed theorem (member 'foo *a*) and
; the truth of that proposition depended upon the particular theory computed
; for *a*.  This made it impossible to permit either the use of state in
; "theory expressions" (since different theories could be computed for
; identical worlds, depending on ld-skip-proofsp) or the use of deftheory in
; encapsulate (see below).  The state prohibition forced upon us the ugliness
; of permitting the user to reference the current ACL2 world via the free
; variable W in theory expressions, which we bound appropriately before evaling
; the expressions.

; We abandoned the use of defconstant (now defconst) for these reasons.

; Here is a comment that once illustrated why we did not allow deftheory
; to be used in encapsulate:

; We do not allow deftheory expressions in encapsulate.  This may be a
; severe restriction but it is necessary for soundness given the current
; implementation of deftheory.  Consider the following:

; (encapsulate nil
;   (local (defun foo () 1))
;   (deftheory *u* (all-names w))
;   (defthm foo-thm (member 'foo *u*)))

; where all-names is a user defined function that computes the set of
; all names in a given world.  [Note: Intuitively, (all-names w) is
; (universal-theory nil w).  Depending on how event descriptors are
; handled, that may or may not be correct.  In a recent version of
; ACL2, (universal-theory nil w), if used in an encapsulate, had the
; effect of computing all the names in the theory as of the last
; world-changing form executed by the top-level loop.  But because
; encapsulate did not so mark each term as it executed them,
; universal-theory backed up to the point in w just before the
; encapsulate.  Thus, universal-theory could not be used to get the
; effect intended here.  However, (all-names w) could be defined by
; the user to get what is intended here.]

; When the above sequence is processed in pass 1 of encapsulate *u*
; includes 'foo and hence the defthm succeeds.  But when it is processed
; in pass 2 *u* does not include 'foo and so the assumption of the
; defthm is unsound!  In essence, permitting deftheory in encapsulate is
; equivalent to permitting (w state) in defconst forms.  That is
; disallowed too (as is the use of any variable in an defconst form).
; If you can set a constant as a function of the world, then you can use
; the constant to determine which encapsulate pass you are in.

; WARNING: Keep this in sync with destructure-expansion, elide-locals-rec,
; make-include-books-absolute, and find-first-non-local-name.

; Note: For a test of this function, see the reference to foo.lisp below.

; Orig-form is used for error reporting.  It is either nil, indicating that
; errors should refer to form, or else it is a form from a superior call of
; this function.  So it is typical, though not required, to call this with
; orig-form = nil at the top level.  If we encounter a macro call and orig-form
; is nil, then we set orig-form to the macro call so that the user can see that
; macro call if the check fails.

; This function checks that form is a tree whose tips are calls of the symbols
; listed in names, and whose interior nodes are each of one of the following
; forms.

; (local &)
; (skip-proofs &)
; (with-guard-checking-event g &) ; g in *guard-checking-values*; (quote g) ok
; (with-output ... &)
; (with-prover-step-limit ... &)
; (with-prover-time-limit ... &)
; (make-event #)

; where each & is checked.  The # forms above are unrestricted, although the
; result of expanding the argument of make-event (by evaluation) is checked.
; Note that both 'encapsulate and 'progn are typically in names, and their
; sub-events aren't checked by this function until evaluation time.

; In addition, if portcullisp is t we are checking that the forms are
; acceptable as the portcullis of some book and we enforce the additional
; restriction noted below.

;   (local &) is illegal because such a command would be skipped
;   when executing the portcullis during the subsequent include-book.

; Formerly we also checked here that include-book is only applied to absolute
; pathnames.  That was important for insuring that the book that has been read
; into the certification world is not dependent upon :cbd.  Remember that
; (include-book "file") will find its way into the portcullis of the book we
; are certifying and there is no way of knowing in the portcullis which
; directory that book comes from if it doesn't explicitly say.  However, we now
; use fix-portcullis-cmds to modify include-book forms that use relative
; pathnames so that they use absolute pathnames instead, or cause an error
; trying.

; We allow defaxioms, skip-proofs, and defttags in the portcullis, but we mark
; the book's certificate appropriately.

; In-local-flg is used to enforce restrictions in the context of LOCAL on the
; use of (table acl2-defaults-table ...), either directly or by way of events
; such as defun-mode events and set-compile-fns that set this table.  (We used
; to make these restrictions when portcullisp is t, because we restored the
; initial acl2-defaults-table before certification, and hence it was misguided
; for the user to be setting the defun-mode or the compile flag in the
; certification world since they were irrelevant to the world in which the
; certification is done.)  A non-nil value of in-local-flg means that we are in
; the scope of LOCAL.  In that case, if we are lexically within an encapsulate
; but not LOCAL when restricted to the nearest such encapsulate, then
; in-local-flg is 'local-encapsulate.  Otherwise, if we are in the scope of
; LOCAL, but we are in an included book and not in the scope of LOCAL with
; respect to that book, then in-local-flg is 'local-include-book.

; Moreover, we do not allow local defaxiom events.  Imagine locally including a
; book that has nil as a defaxiom.  You can prove anything you want in your
; book, and then when you later include the book, there will be no trace of the
; defaxiom in your logical world!

; We do not check that the tips are well-formed calls of the named functions
; (though we do ensure that they are all true lists).

; If names is primitive-event-macros and form can be translated and evaluated
; without error, then it is in fact an embedded event form as described in :DOC
; embedded-event-form.

; We sometimes call this function with names extended by the addition of
; 'DEFPKG.

; If form is rejected, the error message is that printed by str, with #\0 bound
; to the subform (of form) that was rejected.

; We return a value triple (mv erp val state).  If erp is nil then val is the
; event form to be evaluated.  Generally that is the result of macroexpanding
; the input form.  However, if (perhaps after some macroexpansion) form is a
; call of local that should be skipped, then val is nil.

; ev-lst is not an embedded event form and otherwise is as explained below.  If
; erp is nil, then: value is the final value (or nil if ev-lst is empty);
; expansion-alist associates the (+ index n)th member E of ev-lst with its
; expansion if there was any make-event expansion subsidiary to E, ordered by
; index from smallest to largest (accumulated in reverse order); and kpa-result
; is derived from kpa as described below.  If erp is not nil, then let n be the
; (zero-based) index of the event in ev-lst that translated or evaluated to
; some (mv erp0 ...) with non-nil erp0.  Then we return (mv t (+ index n)
; state) if the error was during translation, else (mv (list erp0) (+ index n)
; state).  Except, in the special case that there is no error but we find that
; make-event was called under some non-embedded-event form, we return (mv
; 'make-event-problem (+ index n) state).

; Environment is a list containing at most one of 'certify-book or 'pcert, and
; also perhaps 'encapsulate indicate whether we are under a certify-book
; (possibly doing provisional certification) and/or an encapsulate.  Note that
; 'certify-book is not present when certify-book has been called only to write
; out a .acl2x file.

; Other-control is either :non-event-ok, used for progn!, or else t or nil for
; the make-event-chk in chk-embedded-event-form.

; Kpa is generally nil and not of interest, in which case kpa-result (mentioned
; above) is also nil.  However, if eval-event-lst is being called on behalf of
; certify-book, then kpa is initially the known-package-alist just before
; evaluation of the forms in the book.  As soon as a different (hence larger)
; known-package-alist is observed, kpa is changed to the current index, i.e.,
; the index of the event that caused this change to the known-package-alist;
; and this parameter is not changed on subsequent recursive calls and is
; ultimately returned.  Ultimately certify-book will cdr away that many
; expansion-alist entries before calling pkg-names.

; Caller is as in process-embedded-events.  We introduced this argument on the
; advent of setting world global 'cert-replay.  (It wasn't sufficient to query
; the environment argument for this purpose, because we don't want to set
; 'cert-replay here when processing events under a progn.)

; Channel is generally (proofs-co state), but doesn't have to be.

; A non-nil value of quietp suppresses printing of the event and the result.

; Note on this recursion: The recursion below is potentially disastrously slow.
; Imagine that proto-wrld3 is a list of 10,000 repetitions of the element e.
; Imagine that wrld3 is the extension produced by adding 1000 more copies of e.
; Then the equal below will fail the first 1000 times, but it will only fail
; after confirming that the first 10,000 e's in wrld3 are the same as the
; corresponding ones in proto-wrld3, i.e., the equal will do a root-and-branch
; walk through proto-wrld3 1000 times.  When finally the equal succeeds it
; potentially does another root-and-branch exploration of proto-wrld3.
; However, this worst-case scenario is not likely.  More likely, if wrld3 is an
; extension of proto-wrld3 then the first element of wrld3 differs from that of
; proto-wrld3 -- because either wrld3 begins with a putprop of a new name or a
; new list of lemmas or some other property.  Therefore, most of the time the
; equal below will fail immediately when the two worlds are not equal.  When
; the two worlds are in fact equal, they will be eq, because wrld3 was actually
; constructed by adding triples to proto-wrld3.  So the equal will succeed on
; its initial eq test and avoid a root-and-branch exploration.  This analysis
; is crucial to the practicality of this recursive scheme.  Our worlds are so
; large we simply cannot afford root-and-branch explorations.

; In fact, we did see performance issues when seen was kept as a list of
; triples.  So, we have restructured it as an alist, whose values are alists,
; in which triple (key1 key2 . val) is found in the alist associated with key1.
; After Version_8.2 we changed seen to be a fast-alist.  With that change we

; Important: This function returns those triples in wrld3 that are after
; proto-wrld3, in the same order they have in wrld3. See the comment labeled
; "Important" in the definition of constrained-functions.

; As with the function actual-props, we are only interested in triples that
; aren't superseded by *acl2-property-unbound*.  We therefore do not copy to
; our answer any *acl2-property-unbound* triple or any chronologically earlier
; bindings of the relevant symbol and key!  That is, the list of triples
; returned by this function contains no *acl2-property-unbound* values and
; makes it appear as though the property list was really erased when that value
; was stored.

; Note therefore that the list of triples returned by this function will not
; indicate when a property bound in proto-wrld3 becomes unbound in wrld3.
; However, if a property was stored during the production of wrld3 and the
; subsequently in the production of wrld3 that property was set to
; *acl2-property-unbound*, then the property is gone from the new-trips
; returned here.

; Warning: The value of this function is sometimes used as though it were the
; 'current-acl2-world!  It is a legal property list world.  If it gets into a
; getprop on 'current-acl2-world the answer is correct but slow.  Among other
; things, we use new-trips to compute the ancestors of a definition defined
; within an encapsulate -- knowing that functions used in those definitions but
; defined outside of the encapsulate (and hence, outside of new-trips) will be
; treated as primitive.  That way we do not explore all the way back to ground
; zero when we are really just looking for the subfunctions defined within the
; encapsulate.

; See new-trips-rec for further comments.

; This function is the heart of the second pass of encapsulate, include-book,

; 'encapsulate-pass-2, 'include-book, 'certify-book, 'defstobj, or
; 'defabsstobj.  Note: There is no function encapsulate-pass-1, but it is still
; a ``caller.''

; Acl2-defaults-table is either a legal alist value for acl2-defaults-table or
; else is one of :do-not-install or :do-not-install!.  If an alist, then we may
; install a suitable acl2-defaults-table before executing the events in ev-lst,

; it is not already there) after executing those events.  But the latter of
; these is skipped if acl2-defaults-table is :do-not-install, and both are
; skipped if acl2-defaults-table is :do-not-install!.

; The name ee-entry stands for ``embedded-event-lst'' entry.  It is consed onto
; the embedded-event-lst for the duration of the processing of ev-lst.  The
; length of that list indicates how deep these evs are.  For example, if the
; embedded-event-lst is

;   ((defstobj ...)
;    (encapsulate nil)
;    (include-book ...)
;    (encapsulate ((p (x y) (nil nil) (nil)) ...)))

; then the ev-lst is the ``body'' of a defstobj, which occurs in the body of an
; encapsulate, which is in an include-book, which is in an encapsulate.

; The shape of an ee-entry is entirely up to the callers and the customers of
; the embedded-event-lst, with three exceptions:
; (a) the ee-entry must always be a consp;
; (b) if the car of the ee-entry is 'encapsulate then the cadr is the internal
;     form signatures of the functions being constrained; and
; (c) if the car of the ee-entry is 'include-book then the cadr is the
;     full-book-name.
; We refer to the signatures in (b) as insigs below and think of insigs as nil
; for all ee-entries other than encapsulates.

; Ev-lst is the list of alleged events.  Pkg is the value we should use for
; current-package while we are processing the events.  This affects how forms
; are prettyprinted.  It also affects how the prompt looks.

; We first extend the current world of state by insigs (if caller is
; 'encapsulate-pass-2) and extend the embedded event list by ee-entry.  We then
; extend further by doing each of events in ev-lst while ld-skip-proofsp is set
; to skip-proofsp, checking that they are indeed embedded-event-forms.  If that
; succeeds, we restore embedded-event-lst, install the world, and return.

; If caller is not 'encapsulate-pass-2, then the return value includes an
; expansion-alist that records the result of expanding away every make-event
; call encountered in the course of processing the given ev-lst.  Each pair (n
; . ev) in expansion-alist asserts that ev is the result of expanding away
; every make-event call during evaluation of the nth member of ev-lst (starting
; with index for the initial member of ev-lst), though if no such expansion
; took place then this pair is omitted.  If caller is 'certify-book, then the
; return value is the cons of this expansion-alist onto either the initial
; known-package-alist, if that has not changed, or else onto the index of the
; first event that changed the known-package-alist (where the initial
; in-package event has index 0).

; If caller is 'encapsulate-pass-2, then since the final world is in STATE, we
; use the value component of the non-erroneous return triple to return the
; world extended by the signatures (and the incremented depth).  That world,
; called proto-wrld3 in the encapsulate essay and below, is useful only for
; computing (via difference) the names introduced by the embedded events.  We
; still need the expansion-alist described in the preceding paragraph, so the
; value returned for 'encapsulate-pass-2 is the cons of that expansion-alist
; with this proto-wrld3.

; If an error is caused by the attempt to embed the events, we print a warning
; message explaining and pass the error up.

; an encapsulate with the given two arguments.  We don't know if event-form
; will execute without error.  But suppose we could find a name among
; signatures and ev-lst that is guaranteed to be created if event-form were
; successful.  Then if that name is new, we know we won't find event-form in
; wrld and needn't bother looking.  If the name is old and was introduced by a
; corresponding encapsulate (in the sense that the signatures agree and each
; form of the new encapsulate either suitably agrees the corresponding form of
; the old encapsulate -- see corresponding-encaps), then the event is
; redundant.  Otherwise, if this correspondence test fails or if we can't even
; find a name, then we could suffer the search through wrld.  We have found a
; rather dramatic performance improvements (26% of the time cut when including
; community book centaur/sv/tutorial/alu) by doing what we do now, which is to
; avoid that search when we don't find such a name or any make-event call, even
; after macroexpansion.  But we expect most encapsulates to have a readily
; recognized name among their new args and most encapsulates are not redundant,
; so we think most of the time, we'll find a name and it will be new.

; If we find that the current encapsulate is redundant, then we return t unless
; the earlier corresponding encapsulate is not equal to it, in which case we
; return that earlier encapsulate, which is stored in expanded form.  See also

(defun encapsulate-fn (signatures ev-lst state event-form)

; Important Note:  Don't change the formals of this function without reading
; the *initial-event-defmacros* discussion in axioms.lisp.

; The Encapsulate Essay

; The motivation behind this event is to permit one to extend the theory by
; introducing function symbols, and theorems that describe their properties,
; without completely tying down the functions or including all of the lemmas
; and other hacks necessary to lead the system to the proofs.  Thus, this
; mechanism replaces the CONSTRAIN event of Nqthm.  It also offers one way of
; getting some name control, comparable to scopes.  However, it is better than
; just name control because the "hidden" rules are not just apparently hidden,
; they simply don't exist.

; Encapsulate takes two main arguments.  The first is a list of
; "signatures" that describe the function symbols to be hidden.  By
; signature we mean the formals, stobjs-in and stobjs-out of the
; function symbol.  The second is a list of events to execute.  Some
; of these events are tagged as "local" events and the others are not.
; Technically, each element of ev-lst is either an "event form" or
; else an s-expression of the form (LOCAL ev), where ev is an "event
; form."  The events of the second form are the local events.
; Informally, the local events are present only so that we can justify
; (i.e., successfully prove) the non-local events.  The local events
; are not visible in the final world constructed by an encapsulation.

; Suppose we execute an encapsulation starting with ld-skip-proofsp nil in
; wrld1.  We will actually make two passes through the list of events.  The
; first pass will execute each event, proving things, whether it is local or
; not.  This will produce wrld2.  In wrld2, we check that every function symbol
; in signatures is defined and has the signature alleged.  Then we back up to
; wrld1, declare the hidden functions with the appropriate signatures
; (producing what we call proto-wrld3) and replay only the non-local events.
; (Note: if redefinitions are allowed and are being handled by query, the user
; will be presented with two queries for each redefining non-local event.
; There is no assurance that he answers the same way both times and different
; worlds may result.  C'est la vie avec redefinitions.)  During this replay we
; skip proofs.  Having constructed that world we then collect all of the
; theorems that mention any of the newly-introduced functions and consider the
; resulting list as the constraint for all those functions.  (This is a
; departure from an earlier, unsound implementation, in which we only collected
; theorems mentioning the functions declared in the signature.)  However, we
; "optimize" by constructing this list of theorems using only those
; newly-introduced functions that have as an ancestor at least one function
; declared in the signature.  In particular, we do not introduce any
; constraints if the signature is empty, which is reasonable since in that
; case, we may view the encapsulate event the same as we view a book.  At any
; rate, the world we obtain by noting this constraint on the appropriate
; functions is called wrld3, and it is the world produced by a successful
; encapsulation.  By putting enough checks on the kinds of events executed we
; can guarantee that the formulas assumed to create wrld3 from wrld1 are
; theorems that were proved about defined functions in wrld2.

; This is a non-trivial claim and will be the focus of much of our discussion
; below.  This discussion could be eliminated if the second pass consisted of
; merely adding to wrld1 the formulas of the exported names, obtained from
; wrld2.  We do not do that because we want to be able to execute an
; encapsulation quickly if we process one while skipping proofs.  That is,
; suppose the user has produced a script of some session, including some
; encapsulations, and the whole thing has been processed with ld-skip-proofsp
; nil, once upon a time.  Now the user wants to assume that script and and
; continue -- i.e., he is loading a "book".

; Suppose we hit the encapsulation when skipping proofs.  Suppose we are
; again in wrld1 (i.e., processing the previous events of this script
; while skipping proofs has inductively left us in exactly the same
; state as when we did them with proofs).  We are given the event list
; and the signatures.  We want to do here exactly what we did in the
; second pass of the original proving execution of this encapsulate.
; Perhaps more informatively put, we want to do in the second pass of
; the proving execution exactly what we do here -- i.e., the relative
; paucity of information available here (we only have wrld1 and not
; wrld2) dictates how we must handle pass two back there.  Remember, our
; goal is to ensure that the final world we create, wrld3, is absolutely
; identical to that created above.

; Our main problem is that the event list is in untranslated form.
; Two questions arise.

; (1) If we skip an event because it is tagged LOCAL, how will we know
; we can execute (or even translate) the subsequent events without
; error?  For example, suppose one of the events skipped is the
; defmacro of deflemma, and then we see a (deflemma &).  We will have
; to make sure this doesn't happen.  The key here is that we know that
; the second pass of the proving execution of this encapsulate did
; whatever we're doing and it didn't cause an error.  But this is an
; important point about the proving execution of an encapsulate: even
; though we make a lot of checks before the first pass, it is possible
; for the second pass to fail.  When that happens, we'll revert back
; to wrld1 for sanity.  This is unfortunate because it means the user
; will have to suffer through the re-execution of his event list
; before seeing if he has fixed the last error.  We should eventually
; provide some sort of trial encapsulation mechanism so the user can
; see if he's got his signatures and exports correctly configured.

; (2) How do we know that the formulas generated during the second
; pass are exactly the same as those generated during the first pass?
; For example, one of the events might be:

; (if (ld-skip-proofsp state)
;     (defun foo () 3)
;     (defun foo () 2))

; In this case, (foo) would be 2 in wrld2 but 3 in wrld3.

; The key to the entire story is that we insist that the event list
; consist of certain kinds of events.  For lack of a better name, we
; call these "embedded event forms".  Not everything the user might
; want to type in an interactive ACL2 session is an embedded event
; form!  Roughly speaking, an event form translates to a PROGN of
; "primitive events", where the primitive events are appropriate calls
; of such user-level functions as defun and defthm.  By "appropriate"
; we mean STATE only appears where specified by the stobjs-in for each
; event.  The other arguments, e.g., the name of a defthm, must be
; occupied by state free terms -- well, almost.  We allow uses of w so
; that the user can compute things like gensyms wrt the world.  In a
; rough analogy with Lisp, the events are those kinds of commands that
; are treated specially when they are seen at the top-level of a file
; to be compiled.

; Events have the property that while they take state as an argument
; and change it, their changes to the world are a function only of the
; world (and their other arguments).  Because of this property, we
; know that if s1 and s1' are states containing the same world, and s2
; and s2' are the states obtained by executing an event on the two
; initial states, respectively, then the worlds of s2 and s2' are
; equal.

; Thus ends the encapsulate essay.

; Now we develop the book mechanism, which shares a lot with what
; we've just done.  In the discussion that follows, Unix is a
; trademark of Bell Laboratories.

; First, a broad question:  how much security are we trying to provide?
; After all, one could always fake a .cert file, say by calling checksum
; oneself.  Our claim is simply that we only fully "bless" certification runs,
; from scratch, of entire collections of books, without intervention.  Thus,
; there is no soundness problem with using (include-book "hd:ab.lisp") in a
; book certified in a Unix file system and having it mean something completely
; different on the Macintosh.  Presumably the attempt to certify this
; collection on the Macintosh would simply fail.

; How portable do we intend book names to be?  Suppose that one has a
; collection of books, some of which include-book some of the others, where all
; of these include-books use relative path names.  Can we set things up so that
; if one copies all of these .lisp and .cert files to another file system,
; preserving the hierarchical directory relationship, then we can guarantee
; that this collection of books is certifiable (modulo resource limitations)?
; The answer is yes: We use Unix-style pathnames within ACL2.  See :doc
; pathname, and see the Essay on Pathnames in interface-raw.lisp.  (Before
; Version_2.5 we also supported a notion of structured pathnames, similar to
; the "structured directories" concept in CLtL2.  However, the CLtL2 notion was
; just for directories, not file names, and we "deprecated" structured
; pathnames by deleting their documentation around Version_2.5.  We continued
; to support structured pathnames through Version_2.8 for backwards
; compatibility, but no longer.)

; Note.  It is important that regardless of what initial information we store
; in the state that is based on the surrounding operating system, this
; information not be observable in the logical theory.  For example, it would
; really be unfortunate if we did something like:

;  (defconst *foo*
;    #+mswindows 'win
;    #-mswindows 'not-win)

; because then we could certify a book in one ACL2 that contains a theorem
; (equal *foo* 'win), and include this book in another world where that theorem
; fails, thus deriving a contradiction.  In fact, we make the operating-system
; part of the state (as a world global), and figure everything else out about
; book names using that information.

(defun chk-book-name (book-name full-book-name ctx state)

; Book-name is something submitted by the user as a book name.
; Full-book-name is the first result of calling parse-book-name on
; book-name and state.  We check that full-book-name is a string
; ending in ".lisp" or cause an error.  But the error reports
; book-name as the offender.

; This check is important because to form the certification extension we strip
; off the "lisp" and replace it by "cert".  So if this is changed, change
; convert-book-name-to-cert-name and convert-book-name-to-compiled-name.

; Note: Because it is our own code, namely parse-book-name, that tacks on the
; ".lisp" extension, this check is now redundant.  Once upon a time, the user
; was expected to supply the .lisp extension, but that made the execution of
; (include-book "arith.lisp") in raw lisp load the .lisp file rather than the
; .o file.  We've left the redundant check in because we are not sure that
; parse-book-name will be kept in its current form; it has changed a lot

; help us figure out what is used where.  Please try to preserve this
; convention.

; Cert-annotations is an alist.  The alist has three possible keys:
; :SKIPPED-PROOFSP, :AXIOMSP, and :TTAGS.  The possible values of the first two
; are t, nil, or ?, indicating the presence, absence, or possible presence of
; skip-proof forms or defaxioms, respectively.  The forms in question may be
; either LOCAL or non-LOCAL and are in the book itself (not just in some
; subbook).  Even though the cert-annotations is an alist, we compare
; include-book-alists with equality on that component, not ``alist equality.''
; So we are NOT free to drop or rearrange keys in these annotations.

; If the book is uncertified, the book-hash value is nil.  Otherwise it is a
; checksum by default, but if the value of state global 'book-hash-alistp was
; non-nil at certification time, then the book-hash value is an alist; see
; function book-hash-alist and see :doc book-hash.

; Suppose the two alist arguments are each include-book-alists from different
; times.  We check that the first is a subset of the second, in the sense that
; the (familiar-name cert-annotations . book-hash) parts of the first are all
; among those of the second.  We ignore the full names and the user names

; WARNING: Keep this in sync with chk-embedded-event-form,
; destructure-expansion, and elide-locals-rec.

; Form is a command from the current ACL2 world that is known to be an embedded
; event form with respect to names.  However, it is not necessarily an event
; that would actually be stored: in particular, add-include-book-dir (also
; ..-dir!) can take a relative pathname in the command, but will always be
; stored as an event using an absolute pathname; and make-event uses this
; function to convert some relative to absolute pathnames in the make-event
; expansion of form.

; This function can replace relative pathnames by absolute pathnames, according
; to each of the following scenarios.

; (a) We are converting commands in a certification world so that they are
;     suitable for storing in the portcullis commands section of a certificate
;     file.

; (b) We are creating a make-event expansion.

; In the case of (a), we want to make some pathnames absolute in include-book,
; add-include-book-dir!, and add-include-book-dir forms -- possibly using
; sysfile notation (see sysfile-p) -- so that such pathnames are appropriate
; even if the book and its certificate file are moved.  See the comment in
; fix-portcullis-cmds for discussion of case (a).  In the case of (b) we do
; this as well, just in case the make-event form is ultimately in the
; certification world.  It is tempting not to bother if we are processing the
; event from a book, during include-book or certify-book, since then we know
; it's not in the portcullis.  But rather than think about how making those
; special cases might affect redundancy, we always handle make-event.

; Starting after Version_3.6.1, we allow an include-book pathname for a
; portcullis command to remain a relative pathname if it is relative to the cbd
; of the book.  That change avoided a failure to certify community book
; books/fix-cert/test-fix-cert1.lisp (now defunct) that initially occurred when
; we started including portcullis commands in the checksum, caused by the
; renaming of an absolute pathname in an include-book portcullis command.  Note
; that since a make-event in a certification world is evaluated without knowing
; the ultimate cbd for certification, we always convert to an absolute pathname
; in case (b), the make-event case.

; Cbd is the connected-book-directory just after evaluating form, and hence
; (since form is an embedded event form) also just before evaluating form.  Dir
; is the directory of the book being certified (case (a)), but is nil for the
; make-event case (case (b)).

; Consider the case that we are processing the portcullis commands for a book,
; bk, that is in the process of being certified.  We want to ensure that form,
; an include-book form, refers to the same book as when originally processed as
; it does when later being processed as a portcullis command of bk.  When bk is
; later included, the connected-book-directory will be bound to dir, which is
; the directory of the book being certified.  Therefore, if the
; connected-book-directory at the time form was processed, namely cbd, is the
; same as dir, then we do not need bk to be an absolute pathname: the same
; connected-book-directory as when originally processed (namely, cbd) will be
; used as the connected-book-directory when the book is being included as a
; portcullis command of bk (namely, connected-book-directory dir).
; Well... actually, if bk is a system book, and if the system books are moved,
; then cbd and dir will change but their equality (and inequality) will be
; preserved.

; If cbd is nil then we are recovering portcullis commands from an existing
; certificate, so relative pathnames have already been converted to absolute
; pathnames when necessary, and no conversion is needed here.

; If cbd is non-nil and dir is nil, then we are converting pathnames for some
; purposes other than the portcullis of a book being certified, so there is no
; need to convert to an absolute pathname.

; If we have an absolute pathname, either by conversion or because the
; include-book originally referenced an absolute pathname under the system
; books directory, then we convert to using :dir :system.

; To summarize much of the above: if cbd is nil or if cbd and dir are equal, we
; can skip any pathname conversion and fall through to the next top-level COND
; branch, where form is returned unchanged -- except in both cases, an absolute
; pathname under the system books directory is replaced using :dir :system.

; For background on the discussion below, see the Essay on Hidden Packages.

; Defpkg-items is a list of "defpkg items" each of the form (list name imports
; body doc book-path) representing a list of package definitions.  We return a
; list of defpkg events, corresponding to some of these defpkg items, that can
; be executed in a world whose known-package-alist is earlier-kpa.  The primary
; reason a defpkg is in the returned list is that its package is not in
; base-kpa (not even hidden).  The second reason is that we need to define a
; package P1 not already in earlier-kpa if we add another package P2 whose
; import list contains a symbol in package P1; we close under this process.

; This function is called at the end of the include-book phase of certify-book.
; In that case, base-kpa is the known-package-alist at that point, earlier-kpa
; is the known-package-alist of the certification world, and defpkg-items
; contains an item for each name of a package in the known-package-alist at the
; end of the earlier, admissibility pass of certify-book that was not defined
; in the certification world.  To illustrate the "second reason" above, let us
; suppose that the book being certified contains forms (include-book "book1")
; and (local (include-book "book2")), where book1 defines (defpkg "PKG1" ...)
; and book2 defines (defpkg "PKG2" '(PKG1::SYM)).  Then we want to add the
; definition of "PKG2" to the portcullis, but in order to do so, we need to add
; the definition of "PKG1" as well, even though it will eventually be included
; by way of book1.  And, we need to be sure to add the defpkg of "PKG1" before
; that of "PKG2".

; This function is also called on behalf of puff-fn1, where defpkg-items
; corresponds to the packages in known-package-alist in the world at completion
; of the command about to be puffed, and base-kpa and earlier-kpa correspond to
; the known-package-alist just before that command.  In that case there is no
; need for the "second reason" above, but for simplicity we call this same
; function.

; This function is called during certification of a book whose directory's
; absolute pathname is dir.  It modifies cmds by making relative pathnames
; absolute when necessary, and also by adding defpkg events for hidden packages
; from the certification world, as explained in the Essay on Hidden Packages.
; We explain these two aspects in turn.

; Certify-book needs to insist that each pathname for an include-book in the
; portcullis refer to the intended file, in particular so that the actual file
; read is not dependent upon cbd.  Consider for example:

; :set-cbd "/usr/home/moore/"
; (include-book "prelude")
; :set-cbd "/usr/local/src/library/"
; (certify-book "user")

; A naive implementation would provide a portcullis for "user" that contains
; (include-book "prelude").  But there is no clue as to the directory on which
; "prelude" resides.  Note that "prelude" does not represent an absolute
; pathname.  If it did represent an absolute pathname, then it would have to be
; the full book name because parse-book-name returns x when x represents an
; absolute pathname.

; We deal with the issue above by allowing relative pathnames for include-book
; commands in the certification world, but modifying them, when necessary, to
; be appropriate absolute pathnames.  We say "when necessary" because
; include-book-fn sets the cbd to the directory of the book, so if the relative
; pathname resolves against that cbd to be the correct full book name, then no
; modification is necessary.

; This function takes the original cmds and a list of embedded event forms.  We
; return a list of commands that is guaranteed to be free of include-books with
; inappropriate relative pathnames, that nevertheless is equivalent to the
; original cmds from the standpoint of subsequent embedded events.  (Or, we
; return an error, but in fact we believe that that will not happen.)

; As mentioned at the outset above, this function also adds defpkg events.  We
; trust that the portcullis is a legal sequence of commands (actually, events),
; so the only point is to added hidden packages as per the Essay on Hidden
; Packages.

; Call this function using the same names parameter as that used when verifying
; that cmds is a list of embedded event forms.

; Ch is a channel pointing to a tail of some file.  Template is a list for
; which each member is either a distinct keyword or nil.  We return a list of
; values in one-one correspondence with template, corresponding to values that
; have been read in order from ch -- except, each keyword value is a
; "placeholder" that indicates an optional value preceded by the indicated
; keyword.  For example, suppose template is (:k1 :k2 nil :k3 :k4 nil), and
; forms in the tail of the file indicated by ch are (:k1 a b :k4 c d).  Then
; the value returned is the list (a nil b nil c d), since :k2 and :k3 are
; missing.

; Suppose however that the first form in the tail of the file is :k2.  In that
; case we don't want to return a first value of :k2 for :k1; rather, we return
; nil for :k1 and consider :k2 to be present.

; On the other hand, suppose that the first form in the tail of the file is
; :k3.  Since in the template nil resides between :k1 and :k3, then the value
; corresponding to :k3 cannot be the next value to be read.  So to simplify
; this function, we assume that no keyword in template can be a value that is
; to be returned -- such a keyword must always be a placeholder.

; The error triple may have a non-nil error component.  We confess that in
; order to make sense of such a return, one needs to read the code below.

; is true, evaluate them in state.  Ld-skip-proofsp is 'include-book for this
; operation because these commands have all been successfully carried out in a
; boot strap world.  If this doesn't cause an error, then we read the optional
; :expansion-alist, cert-data, pre- and post- alists, and final cert-hash.  If
; the pre- and post-alists are not present or are of the wrong type, or if
; values are of the wrong type or there is additional text in the file, or the
; final cert-hash is inaccurate, we may cause an error.

; Light-chkp is t when we are content to avoid rigorous checks on the
; certificate, say because we are simply interested in some information that
; need not be fully trusted.

; Unless we are told to ignore the pre-alist, we check that it is a subset of
; the current include-book-alist.  Failure of this check may lead either to an
; error or to the assumption that the book is uncertified, according to the
; suspect-book-action-alist.  If we don't cause an error we return either the
; certificate object, which is a cert-obj record, or else we return nil,
; indicating that the book is presumed uncertified.  The cert-obj record
; contains not only the "-sysfile" versions of the pre- and post-alist, which

; in which the sysfiles have been converted to absolute pathnames.

; File1 is a book name and file2 is its associated certificate file name.  Ch

; it.  We now read the rest of file2 and either open the portcullis (skipping
; evaluation if evalp is nil) and return a cert-obj record or nil if we are
; assuming the book, or we cause an error.

; The code below is tedious and we here document it.  The first thing we look
; for is the ACL2 Version number printed immediately after the in-package.
; This function is made more complicated by four facts.  We do not know for
; sure that the certificate file is well-formed in any version.  Also, we do
; not know whether include-book-er causes an error or just prints a warning
; (because that is determined by suspect-book-action-alist and the values of
; the state globals defaxioms-okp-cert and skip-proofs-okp-cert).  Suppose we
; read a purported version string, val, that does not match the current
; acl2-version.  Then we cause an include-book-er which may or may not signal
; an error.  If it does not then we are to assume the uncertified book so we
; must proceed with the certificate check as though the version were ok.
; Basically this means we want to call chk-raise-portcullis, but we must first
; make sure we've read to the beginning of the portcullis.  If val looks like
; an ACL2 Version string, then this file is probably a well-formed Version 1.9+
; file and we must read the :BEGIN-PORTCULLIS-CMDS before proceeding.
; Otherwise, this isn't well-formed and we cause an error.

; This function writes out, and returns, a certificate file.  We first give
; that file a temporary name.  Our original motivation was the expectation that
; afterwards, compilation is performed and then the certificate file is renamed
; to its suitable .cert name.  This way, we expect that that the compiled file
; will have a write date that is later than (or at least, not earlier than) the
; write date of the certificate file; yet, we can be assured that "make"
; targets that depend on the certificate file's existence will be able to rely
; implicitly on the compiled file's existence as well.  After Version_4.3 we
; arranged that even when not compiling we use a temporary file, so that (we
; hope) once the .cert file exists, it has all of its contents.

; We assume file is a full-book-name.  The portcullis is a pair (cmds
; . pre-alist-sysfile), where cmds is the list of portcullis commands that
; created the world in which the certification was done, and pre-alist-sysfile
; is the include-book-alist just before certification was done, with
; full-book-names under the system books converted to sysfiles.  Post-alist1 is
; the include-book-alist after proving the events in file and post-alist2 is
; the include-book-alist after just including the events in file.  If they are
; different it is because the book included some subbooks within LOCAL forms
; and those subbooks did not get loaded for post-alist2.

; To verify that a subsequent inclusion is ok, we really only need post-alist2.
; That is, if the book included some LOCAL subbook then it is not necessary
; that that subbook even exist when we include the main book.  On the other
; hand, we trace calls of skip-proofs using the call of
; skipped-proofsp-in-post-alist in include-book-fn, which requires
; consideration of LOCALly included books; and besides, it might be useful to
; know what version of the subbook we used during certification, although the
; code at the moment makes no use of that.  So we massage post-alist1 so that
; any subbook in it that is not in post-alist2 is marked LOCAL.  Thus,
; post-alist3-abs, below, will be of the form

; ((full1 user1 familiar1 cert-annotations1 . book-hash1)
;  ...
;  (LOCAL (fulli useri familiari cert-annotationsi . book-hashi))
;  ...
;  (fullk userk familiark cert-annotationsk . book-hashk))

; and thus is not really an include-book-alist.  By deleting the LOCAL
; elements from it we obtain post-alist2.

; We write a certificate file for file.  The certificate file has the
; following form:

; (in-package "ACL2")
; "ACL2 Version x.y"
; :BEGIN-PORTCULLIS-CMDS  ; this is here just to let us check that the file
; cmd1                    ; is not a normal list of events.
; ...
; cmdk
; :END-PORTCULLIS-CMDS
; pre-alist-sysfile
; post-alist3-sysfile
; cert-hash

; where cert-hash may be the checksum of ((cmds . pre-alist-sysfile)
; . post-alist3-sysfile) -- see function cert-hash -- and where
; post-alist3-sysfile is the result of converting to sysfiles those
; full-book-names in post-alist3-abs that are under the system books.

; The reason the portcullis commands are written this way, rather than
; as a single object, is that we can't read them all at once since
; they may contain DEFPKGs.  We have to read and eval the cmdi
; individually.

;;;   Frequently, the former has more entries than the latter because the
;;;   former includes LOCAL books. So compare corresponding entries, focusing
;;;   on those in the latter.  Each entry is of the form (name1 name2 name3
;;;   alist . book-hash).  Name1 is the full name, name2 is the name as written
;;;   in an include-book event, and name3 is the ``familiar'' name of the
;;;   file. The alist indicates the presence or absence of problematic forms in
;;;   the file, such as DEFAXIOM events.  For example, (:AXIOMSP . T) means
;;;   there were defaxiom events; (:AXIOMSP . NIL) -- which actually prints as
;;;   (:AXIOMSP) -- means there were no defaxiom events. Finally, book-hash is
;;;   either an integer checksum on the contents of the file at the time it
;;;   was certified, an alist (see book-hash-alist), or else book-hash is nil
;;;   indicating that the file is not certified.  Note that if the book-hash is
;;;   nil, the entry prints as (name1 name2 name3 alist).  Go figure.

; Essay on Guard Checking

; We bind the state global variable guard-checking-on to t in certify-book-fn
; and in include-book-fn (using state-global-let*), as well as in prove and
; puff-fn1.  We bind it to nil in pc-single-step-primitive.  We do not bind
; guard-checking-on in defconst-fn.  Here we explain these decisions.

; We prefer to bind guard-checking-on to a predetermined fixed value when
; certifying or including books.  Why?  Book certification is a logical act.
; :Set-guard-checking is intended to be extra-logical, giving the user control
; over evaluation in the interactive loop, and hence we do not want it to
; affect how books are processed, either during certification or during
; inclusion.

; So the question now is whether to bind guard-checking-on to t or to nil for
; book certification and for book inclusion.  (We reject :none and :all because
; they can be too inefficient.)  We want it to be the case that if a book is
; certified, then subsequently it can be included.  In particular, it would be
; unfortunate if certification is done in an environment with guard checking
; off, and then later we get a guard violation when including the book with
; guard checking on.  So we should bind guard-checking-on the same in
; certify-book as in include-book.

; We argue now for binding guard-checking-on to t in certify-book-fn (and
; hence, as argued above, in include-book-fn as well).  Consider this scenario
; brought to our attention by Eric Smith: one certifies a book with
; guard-checking-on bound to nil, but then later gets a guard violation when
; loading that book during a demo using LD (with the default value of t for
; guard-checking-on).  Horrors!  So we bind guard-checking-on to t in
; certify-book-fn, to match the default in the loop.

; We note that raw Lisp evaluation should never take place for the body of a
; defconst form (outside the boot-strap), because the raw Lisp definition of
; defconst avoids such evaluation when the name is already bound, which should
; be the case from prior evaluation of the defconst form in the ACL2 loop.
; Value-triple also is not evaluated in raw Lisp, where it is defined to return
; nil.

; We bind guard-checking-on to nil in prove, because proofs can use evaluation
; and such evaluation should be done in the logic, without regard to guards.

; It can be important to check guards during theory operations like
; union-theory.  For example, with guard checking off in Version_2.9, one gets
; a hard Lisp error upon evaluation of the following form.

; (in-theory (union-theories '((:rewrite no-such-rule))
;                            (current-theory 'ground-zero)))

; (Aside.  One does not get such an error in Version_2.8, because *1* functions
; checked guards of system functions regardless of the value of
; guard-checking-on; but we have abandoned that aggressive approach, relying
; instead on safe-mode.)  Our solution is to bind guard-checking-on to t in
; eval-theory-expr, which calls simple-translate-and-eval and hence causes the
; guards to be checked.

; Note that guard-checking-on is bound to nil in pc-single-step-primitive.  We
; no longer recall why, but we may as well preserve that binding.

(defun expansion-filename (file)

; We use a .lsp suffix instead of .lisp for benefit of the makefile system,
; which by default looks for .lisp files to certify.

; File can be either an ACL2 filename or an OS filename (see the Essay on
; Pathnames).  We add the ".lisp" suffix either way.  This could be problematic
; in the case that one adds the suffix to an ACL2 filename with this function,
; and then converts the result to an OS filename -- is that really the same as
; converting the ACL2 filename to an OS filename and then adding the suffix?
; We believe that yes, these are the same, since the conversion of a filename
; is presumably a matter of converting the individual bytes or characters, in
; order.

; Expansion-filename is the expansion file for a certified book (or, a book
; whose certification is nearly complete) that has been through
; include-book-fn.  (We call set-current-package below instead of the
; corresponding f-put-global as a partial check that this inclusion has taken
; place.)  We write out that expansion file, instead causing an error if we
; cannot open it.

; The following issue came up when attempting to compile an expansion file with
; GCL that had been created with CCL.  (We don't officially support using more
; than one host Lisp on the same files, but it's convenient sometimes to do
; that anyhow.)  The community book in question was
; books/projects/legacy-defrstobj/typed-record-tests.lisp, and ACL2 was used,
; not ACL2(h).  The event that caused the trouble was this one:

;   (make-event
;    `(def-typed-record char
;       :elem-p        (characterp x)
;       :elem-list-p   (character-listp x)
;       :elem-fix      (character-fix x)
;       :elem-default  ,(code-char 0)
;       ;; avoid problems with common-lisp package
;       :in-package-of foo))

; In the expansion file, (code-char 0) was written by CCL as #\Null:
; write-expansion-file calls print-object$ (and print-objects, which calls
; print-object$), and print-object$ calls prin1, which prints "readably".  Now
; our ACL2 readtable can't handle #\Null, but we call compile-certified-file on
; the expansion file, and that calls acl2-compile-file, and that binds
; *readtable* to *reckless-acl2-readtable*.  But the latter binds #\ to the old
; character reader, which can handle #\Null in CCL, but not in GCL.

  #+acl2-loop-only

; The next forms introduce packages so that ensuing defparameter forms can be
; read in.  The form (maybe-introduce-empty-pkg-1 name) generates defpackage
; forms for name, which are no-ops when the packages already exist.  For GCL it
; seems important to put all the defpackage forms at the top of any file to
; compile, immediately after the initial in-package form; otherwise we have
; seen scary warnings in GCL 2.6.7.  So we lay down these defpackage forms
; first, and then we lay down maybe-introduce-empty-pkg-2 calls in order to
; tell ACL2 that any such packages not already known to ACL2 are acceptable,
; provided they have no imports.  (If they have imports then they must have
; been defined in raw Lisp, and ACL2 should complain.  They might even have
; been defined in raw Lisp if they do not have imports, of course, but there
; are limits to how hard we will work to protect the user who traffics in raw
; Lisp evaluation.)

; Essay on .acl2x Files (Double Certification)

; Sometimes make-event expansion requires a trust tag, but the final event does
; not, in which case we may want a "clean" certificate that does not depend on
; a trust tag.  For example, a make-event form might call an external tool to
; generate an ordinary ACL2 event.  Certify-book solves this problem by
; supporting a form of "double certification" that can avoid putting trust tags
; into the certificate.  This works by saving the expansion-alist from a first
; certification of foo.lisp into file foo.acl2x, and then certifying in a way
; that first reads foo.acl2x to avoid redoing make-event expansions, thus
; perhaps avoiding the need for trust tags.  One could even certify on a
; separate machine first in order to generate foo.acl2x, for added security.

; Key to the implementation of this ``double certification'' is a new state
; global, write-acl2x, which is set in order to enable writing of the .acl2x
; file.  Also, a new certify-book keyword argument, :ttagsx, overrides :ttags
; if write-acl2x is true.  So the flow is as follows, where a single
; certify-book command is used in both certifications, with :ttagsx specifying
; the ttags used in the first certification and :ttags specifying the ttags
; used in the second certification (perhaps nil).
;
; First certification: (set-write-acl2x t state) and certify, writing out
; foo.acl2x.  Second certification: Replace forms as per foo.acl2x; write out
; foo.cert.

; Why do we use a state global, rather than adding a keyword option to
; certify-book?  The reason is that it's easier this way to provide makefile
; support: the same .acl2 file can be used for each of the two certifications
; if the makefile sends an extra set-write-acl2x form before the first
; certification.  (And, that is what is done in community books file
; books/Makefile-generic.)

; Note that include-book is not affected by this proposal, because foo.acl2x is
; not consulted: its effect is already recorded in the .cert file produced by
; the second certify-book call.  However, after that certification, the
; certificate is not polluted by ttags that were needed only for make-event
; expansion (assuming :check-expansion has its default value of nil in each
; case).

; Some details:

; - If write-acl2x has value t, then we overwrite an existing .acl2x file.  (If
;   there is demand we could cause an error instead; maybe we'll support value
;   :overwrite for that.  But we don't have any protection against overwriting
;   .cert files, so we'll start by not providing any for .acl2x files, either.)
;   If write-acl2x has value nil, then certify-book will use the .acl2x file if
;   it exists and is not older than the .lisp file; but it will never insist on
;   a .acl2x file (though the Makefile could do that).  We could consider
;   adding an argument to certify-book that insists on having an up-to-date
;   .acl2x file.

; - If write-acl2x has value t, we exit as soon as the .acl2x file is written.
;   Not only does this avoid computation necessary for writing a .cert file,
;   but also it avoids potential confusion with makefiles, so that presence of
;   a .cert file indicates that certification is truly complete.

; - When foo.acl2x exists and write-acl2x has value nil, we check that the form
;   read is suitable input to subst-by-position: an alist with increasing posp
;   keys, whose last key does not exceed the number of events to process.

; - Consider the input expansion-alist used by the second certify-book call,
;   taken from the .acl2x file (to substitute for top-level forms in the book),
;   and consider an arbitrary entry (index . form) from that input
;   expansion-alist such that index doesn't appear in the generated
;   expansion-alist written to the .cert file.  Before writing that generated
;   expansion-alist to the .cert file, we first add every such (index . form)
;   to the generated expansion-alist, to make complete the recording of all
;   replacements of top-level forms from the source book.  Note that in this
;   case form is not subject to make-event expansion, or else index would have
;   been included already in the generated expansion-alist.

; - Note that one could create the .acl2x file manually to contain any forms
;   one likes, to be processed in place of forms in the source book.  There is
;   no problem with that.

; - The same use of *print-circle* will be made in writing out the .acl2x file
;   as is used when writing the :expansion-alist to the .cert file.

; One might think that one would have to incorporate somehow the checksum of
; the .acl2x file.  But the logical content of the certified book depends only
; on the .lisp file and the expansion-alist recorded in the .cert file, not on
; the .acl2x file (which was only used to generate that recorded
; expansion-alist).  We already have a mechanism to check those: in particular,
; chk-raise-portcullis (called by chk-certificate-file1) checks the checksum of
; the certificate object against the final value in the .cert file.

; Makefile support is available; see community books file
; books/Makefile-generic.

; We may need to create a defpkg in the certification world in order to read
; the expansion-alist from the certificate before evaluating events from the
; book.  As long as there have been no new defpkg events since the end of the
; portcullis command evaluation, there is no problem.  (Note that make-event-fn
; calls bad-lisp-objectp to check that the expansion is readable after
; evaluating the make-event call.)  But once we get a new package, any
; subsequent form in the expansion-alist may need that new package to be
; defined in order for ACL2 to read the expansion-alist from the .cert file.
; Here we take the first step towards finding those packages.

;   X is not declared IGNOREd or IGNORABLE.  See :DOC set-ignore-ok.

; Additionally, because the body of the defchoose is already translated, we
; lose IGNORABLE declarations from inside it.  IGNORE declarations are dealt
; with by wrapping the lambda argument in HIDE, but we don't have such a hack
; for dealing with IGNORABLE.  So we actually set IGNORE-OK to T temporarily
; here to avoid erroring out in such cases.  Otherwise, the following form will
; unexpectedly produce an error:

; (defchoose foo (x) () (let ((y nil)) (declare (ignorable y)) (consp x)))

; Do we need to inhibit warnings given that we're turning on ignore-ok?  The
; user code on which this is run has already been translated, so any legitimate
; warnings for that have already been issued.  Any new warnings from this
; translation would therefore be either artifacts from re-translating the
; translation of the user code, or else warnings about the system code wrapped
; around it, neither of which the user will want to see.

(defun defchoose-constraint-extra (fn bound-vars formals body)

; WARNING: If the following comment is removed, then eliminate the reference to
; it in :doc defchoose.

; Note that :doc conservativity-of-defchoose contains an argument showing that
; we may assume that there is a definable enumeration, enum, of the universe.
; Thus, for any definable property that is not always false, there is a "least"
; witness, i.e., a least n for which (enum n) satisfies that property.  Thus, a
; function defined with defchoose is definable: pick the least witness if there
; is one, else nil.  From this definition it is clear that the following
; formula holds, where formals2 is a copy of formals that is disjoint both from
; formals and from bound-vars, and where tbody2 is the result of replacing
; formals by formals2 in tbody, the translated body of the defchoose.  (If
; bound-vars is a list of length 1, then we use let rather than mv-let in this
; formula.)

; (or (equal (fn . formals)
;            (fn . formals2))
;     (mv-let (bound-vars (fn . formals))
;       (and tbody
;            (not tbody2)))
;     (mv-let (bound-vars (fn . formals2))
;       (and tbody2
;            (not tbody1))))

; We now outline an argument for the :non-standard-analysis case, which in fact
; provides justification for both defchoose axioms.  The idea is to assume that
; there is a suitable well-ordering for the ground-zero theory and that the
; ground-zero theory contains enough "invisible" functions so that this
; property is preserved by extensions (as discussed in the JAR paper "Theory
; Extensions in ACL2(r) by Gamboa and Cowles).  Here is a little more detail,
; but a nice challenge is to work this out completely.

; The idea of the proof is first to start with what the above paper calls an
; "r-complete" GZ: basically, a ground-zero theory satisfying induction and
; transfer that contains a function symbol for each defun and defun-std.  We
; can preserve r-completeness as we add defun, defun-std, encapsulate, and
; defchoose events (again, as in the above paper).  The key idea for defchoose
; is that GZ should also have a binary symbol, <|, that is axiomatized to be a
; total order.  That is, <| is a "definable well order", in the sense that
; there are axioms that guarantee for each phi(x) that (exists x phi) implies
; that (exists <|-least x phi).  The trick is to add the well-ordering after
; taking a nonstandard elementary extension of the standard reals MS, where
; every function over the reals is represented in MS as the interpretation of a
; function symbol.

; Still as in the above paper, there is a definable fn for the above defchoose,
; obtained by picking the least witness.  Moreover, if body is classical then
; we can first conjoin it with (standard-p bound-var), choose the <|-least
; bound-var with a classical function using defun-std, and then show by
; transfer that this function witnesses the original defchoose.

; and implement the new style of argument recovery.

; Once we have partitioned the args for defstobj, we'll have recovered the
; field-descriptors and a renaming alist.  Our next step is to check that the

; The argument, non-memoizable, is the value of the :non-memoizable keyword of
; the defstobj event introducing name.  Let us consider whether there is a need
; to add a check about :non-memoizable for the case of a stobj with stobj
; fields.

; On the one hand, it is fine for the parent stobj to be memoizable regardless
; of whether any child stobjs are non-memoizable.  Suppose that some child
; stobj is non-memoizable but the (new) parent stobj is memoizable.  The
; concern is the case that some memoized function reads the parent twice on the
; same inputs when between those reads, some child stobj has changed without
; any flushing of memoization tables (because the child stobj is
; non-memoizable).  But the only way to change a child stobj is by way of
; stobj-let, which flushes the memo table for each function that takes the
; parent stobj as an argument (since the parent is memoizable).

; On the other hand, suppose that some child stobj is memoizable but the (new)
; parent stobj is non-memoizable.  In this case, stobj-let does not flush the
; parent stobj's memo tables, and we return to the soundness bug illustrated in
; a comment in stobj-let-fn-raw.

; The functions introduced by defstobj are all defined with
; :VERIFY-GUARDS T.  This means we must ensure that their guards and
; bodies are compliant.  Most of this stuff is mechanically generated
; by us and is guaranteed to be compliant.  But there is a way that a
; user defined function can sneak in.  The user might use a type-spec
; such as (satisfies foo), where foo is a user defined function.

; To discuss the guard issue, we name the functions introduced by
; defstobj, following the convention used in the comment in
; defstobj-template.  The recognizer for the stobj itself will be
; called namep, and the creator will be called create-name.  For each
; field, the following names are introduced: recog-name - recognizer
; for the field value; accessor-name - accessor for the field;
; updater-name - updater for the field; length-name - length of array
; field; resize-name - resizing function for array field.

; We are interested in determining the conditions we must check to
; ensure that each of these functions is Common Lisp compliant.  Both
; the guard and the body of each function must be compliant.
; Inspection of defstobj-axiomatic-defs reveals the following.

; Namep is defined in terms of primitives and the recog-names.  The
; guard for namep is T.  The body of namep is always compliant, if the
; recog-names are compliant and have guards of T.

; Create-name is a constant with a guard of T.  Its body is always
; compliant.

; Recog-name has a guard of T.  The body of recog-name is interesting
; from the guard verification perspective, because it may contain
; translated type-spec such as (satisfies foo) and so we must check
; that foo is compliant.  We must also check that the guard of foo is
; T, because the guard of recog-name is T and we might call foo on
; anything.

; Accessor-name is not interesting:  its guard is namep and its body is
; primitive.  We will have checked that namep is compliant.

; Updater-name is not interesting:  its guard may involve translated
; type-specs and will involve namep, but we will have checked their
; compliance already.

; Length-name and resize-name have guards that are calls of namep, and
; their bodies are known to satisfy their guards.

; So it all boils down to checking the compliance of the body of
; recog-name, for each component.  Note that we must check both that
; the type-spec only involves compliant functions and that every
; non-system function used has a guard of T.

; Essay on Defstobj Definitions

; Consider the following defstobj:

;   (defstobj $st
;     (flag :type t :initially run)
;     (pc   :type (integer 0 255) :initially 128)
;     (mem  :type (array (integer 0 255) (256)) :initially 0)
;     :renaming ((pc pcn)))

; If you call (defstobj-template '$st '((flag ...) ...)) you will get
; back a ``template'' which is sort of a normalized version of the
; event with the renaming applied and all the optional slots filled
; appropriately.  (See the definition of defstobj-template for details.)
; Let template be that template.

; To see the logical definitions generated by this defstobj event, invoke
;   (defstobj-axiomatic-defs '$st template (w state))

; To see the raw lisp definitions generated, invoke
;   (defstobj-raw-defs '$st template nil (w state))

; The *1* functions for the functions are all generated by oneifying
; the axiomatic defs.

; To see the defconsts generated, invoke
;   (defstobj-defconsts
;     (strip-accessor-names (access defstobj-template template
;                                   :field-templates))
;     0)

; It is important the guard conjectures for these functions be
; provable!  They are assumed by the admission process!  To prove
; the guards for the defstobj above, it helped to insert the following
; lemma after the defun of memp but before the definition of memi.

;   (defthm memp-implies-true-listp
;     (implies (memp x)
;              (true-listp x)))

; Even without this lemma, the proof succeeded, though it took much
; longer and involved quite a few generalizations and inductions.

; If you change any of the functions, I recommend generating the axiomatic
; defs for a particular defstobj such as that above and proving the guards.

; Up through v2-7 we also believed that we ensured that the guards in the
; axiomatic defs are sufficient for the raw defs.  However, starting with v2-8,
; this became moot because of the following claim: the raw Lisp functions are
; only called on live stobjs (this change, and others involving :inline, were
; contributed by Rob Sumners).  We believe this claim because of the following
; argument.  Note that there is an exception for the recognizer, which can be
; applied to an ordinary object, but we do not consider this exception here.
;
;   a) The *1* function now has an additional requirement that not only does
;      guard checking pass, but also, all of the stobjs arguments passed in
;      must be the live stobjs in order to execute raw Common Lisp.
;   b) Due to the syntactic restrictions that ACL2 enforces, we know that the
;      direct correspondence between live stobjs and stobj arguments in the
;      raw Common Lisp functions will persist throughout evaluation.
;      -- This can be proven by induction over the sequence of function calls
;         in any evaluation.
;      -- The base case is covered by the binding of stobj parameters to
;         the global live stobj in the acl2-loop, or by the restrictions
;         placed upon with-local-stobj and stobj-let.
;      -- The induction step is proven by the signature requirements of
;         functions that access and/or update stobjs.

; A reasonable question is: Should the guard for resize-name be
; strengthened so as to disallow sizes of at least (1- (expt 2 28))?
; Probably there is no need for this.  Logically, there is no such
; restriction; it is OK for the implementation to insist on such a
; bound when actually executing.

; We introduce the idea of the "template" of a defstobj, which includes a
; normalized version of the field descriptors under the renaming.  See
; basis-a.lisp for defrec forms defstobj-field-template and defstobj-template.

(defun defstobj-field-fns-axiomatic-defs (top-recog var n field-templates wrld)

; Wrld is normally a logical world, but it can be nil when calling this
; function from raw Lisp.

; Warning: Keep the formals in the definitions below in sync with corresponding
; formals defstobj-field-fns-raw-defs.  Otherwise trace$ may not work
; correctly; we saw such a problem in Version_5.0 for a resize function.

; Warning:  See the guard remarks in the Essay on Defstobj Definitions.

; We return a list of defs (see defstobj-axiomatic-defs) for all the accessors,
; updaters, and optionally, array resizing and length, of a single-threaded

; Warning: Each updater definition should immediately follow the corresponding
; accessor definition, so that this is the case for the list of definitions
; returned by defstobj-axiomatic-defs.  That list of definitions becomes the
; 'stobj property laid down by defstobj-fn, and function
; chk-stobj-let/updaters1 assumes that it will find each updater definition in
; that property immediately after the corresponding accessor definition.

; Warning:  See the guard remarks in the Essay on Defstobj Definitions.

; Template is the defstobj-template for name and args and thus
; corresponds to some (defstobj name . args) event.  We generate the
; #+acl2-loop-only defs for that event and return a list of defs.  For
; each def it is the case that (defun . def) is a legal defun; and
; these defs can be executed in the order returned.

; These defs are processed to axiomatize the recognizer, accessor and
; updater functions for the single-threaded resource.  They are also
; oneified when we process the defstobj CLTL-COMMAND to define the *1*
; versions of the functions.  Finally, parts of them are re-used in
; raw lisp code when the code is applied to an object other than the
; live one.

; WARNING: If you change the formals of these generated axiomatic defs, be sure
; to change the formals of the corresponding raw defs.

; Warning: Each updater definition in the list returned should immediately
; follow the corresponding accessor definition, as guaranteed by the call of
; defstobj-field-fns-axiomatic-defs, below.  This is important because
; defstobj-axiomatic-defs provides the 'stobj property laid down by
; defstobj-fn, and the function chk-stobj-let/updaters1 assumes that it will
; find each updater definition in that property immediately after the
; corresponding accessor definition.

; also contains the belated declaration that name is a stobj.  We now
; put the STOBJS-IN and STOBJS-OUT properties for the appropriate
; names.

; The following example from Jared Davis and Sol Swords shows why even arrays
; with elements of type t need to be considered for invariant-risk.

;   To start:

;       (defstobj foo
;         (foo-ch  :type character :initially #\a)
;         (foo-arr :type (array t (3))))

;   The idea is to cause an invalid write to foo-arr that will
;   overwrite foo-ch.  To do this, it is helpful to know the
;   relative addresses of foo-ch and foo-arr.  We can find this
;   out from raw Lisp, but once we know it, it seems pretty
;   reliable, so in the final version there's no need to enter
;   raw Lisp.

;       :q
;       (let ((ch-addr  (ccl::%address-of (aref *the-live-foo* 0)))
;             (arr-addr (ccl::%address-of (aref *the-live-foo* 1))))
;         (list :ch   ch-addr
;               :arr  arr-addr
;               :diff (- ch-addr arr-addr)))
;       (lp)

;   An example result on one invocation on our machine is:

;       (:CH 52914053289693 :ARR 52914053289501 :DIFF 192)

;   When we quit ACL2 and resubmit this, we typically get
;   different offsets for CH and ARR, but the :DIFF seems to be
;   consistently 192.  (In principle, it probably could
;   sometimes be different because it probably depends on how
;   the memory allocation happens to fall out, but in practice
;   it seems to be reliable).  If you want to reproduce this and
;   your machine gets a different result, you may need to adjust
;   the index that you write to to provoke the problem.

;   Since CCL's (array t ...) probably uses 8-byte elements, we
;   should write to address (/ 192 8) = 24.  To do that we will
;   need a program mode function that writes to foo-arri to
;   avoid ACL2's guards from preventing the out-of-bounds write.

;       (defun attack (n v foo)
;         (declare (xargs :mode :program :stobjs foo))
;         (update-foo-arri n v foo))

;   Now we can do something like this:

;       (attack 24 100 foo)

;   After the attack, (foo-ch foo) returns something that Emacs
;   prints as #\^Z, and (char-code (foo-ch foo)) reports 800,
;   which is of course not valid for an ACL2 character.

; The processing above will define the functions in the logic, using
; defun, and that, in turn, will define their *1* counterparts in
; Lisp.  But because of code in defuns-fn, the processing above will
; not define the raw Lisp versions of the functions themselves
; (normally that would be derived from the axiomatic defs just
; processed).  Instead, we will store a CLTL-COMMAND below that
; handles the raw Lisp defs only.

; What follows is hard to follow and rather arcane.  Why do we include
; name in the ee-entry computed above, (defstobj name names)?  That
; entry will be added to the embedded-event-lst by
; process-embedded-events and be inspected by the individual defuns
; done.  Those defuns will recognize their fn name, fn, among names,
; to detect that they are being done as part of a defstobj.  The defun
; will pick up the stobj name, name, from the ee-entry and build it
; into the ignorep entry of the defun CLTL-COMMAND, to be processed by
; add-trip.  In add-trip, the stobj name, name, will find its way into
; the oneify-cltl-code that generates the *1* body for fn.  That body
; contains a throw upon detection of a guard error.  The object thrown
; contains the stobjs-in of the offensive expression, so we will know
; how to print it.  But the stobjs-in of fn is incorrectly set in the
; world right now -- more accurately, will be incorrectly set in the
; world in which the defun is done and the throw form is constructed
; -- because we have not yet declared name to be a stobj.  Indeed, we
; cannot declare it to be a stobj yet since we are defining functions
; that treat it as an ordinary list.  This is the stobj version of the
; super-defun-wart problem.

; Every supporting function is marked with the property

; created when the CLTL-COMMAND below is processed by add-trip.
; Add-trip evals the init form in raw lisp to create the live object
; and assign it to global variables.  It also creates array-based

; user-stobj-alist of the state just as suggested above, provided this
; is not a redefinition.  (For a redefinition of the stobj, it does a

; the live state not explained by the code.  Furthermore, if I called
; it on a fake state, I would get a new fake state in which the new
; stobj was not on the user-stobj-alist.

; Essay on the Correctness of Abstract Stobjs

; In this Essay we provide a semantic foundation for abstract stobjs that shows
; the critical role of :CORRESPONDENCE, :PRESERVED, and :GUARD-THM lemmas.  Our
; motivation is to understand why the standard logical definition of evaluation
; is correctly implemented by how evaluation really works in Lisp, using live
; stobjs.  It will probably be helpful to read the :doc topic for defabsstobj
; before reading this Essay.

; Below, we use the term ``stobj primitive (for s)'' to indicate a function
; introduced by a defstobj or (more often) defabsstobj event (for stobj s).  In
; the case of defabsstobj, an ``:EXEC function'' or ``:LOGIC function'' is a
; stobj primitive associated with an :EXEC or :LOGIC keyword (perhaps by
; default), respectively.

; Informally, we wish to relate two kinds of evaluation, one using :LOGIC
; primitives and one using corresponding :EXEC primitives, in corresponding
; environments where each abstract stobj is bound to an object satisfying its
; :LOGIC recognizer in the first environment and its :EXEC recognizer in the
; second.  Such evaluation will enforce guards before making calls of stobj
; primitives at the :LOGIC level and (as we will see, by the :GUARD-THM
; theorems) guarantee that guards thus hold for calls of stobj primitives at
; the :EXEC level.  Because of the latter, we can even imagine passing live
; stobjs around for the :EXEC evaluation.  But the replacement of ACL2 objects
; by live stobjs is not what's new for abstract stobjs, so we do not address it
; here.  Thus in the remainder of this Essay, we deal only with ACL2 objects,
; without any consideration of raw Lisp evaluation using live stobjs.  We
; imagine two sorts of logical evaluation using either :LOGIC or :EXEC
; primitives, with the goal of showing that they keep the corresponding states
; (latches) in sync.

; Fix an ACL2 world, and let A be a set of abstract stobj names.  We introduce
; a variant of EV, A-evaluation, which models evaluation using :EXEC functions
; for abstract stobjs in A.  (But note that throughout, we ignore the EV
; arguments of state, hard-error-returns-nilp, and aok, which aren't of
; interest for our exposition.  See also the Essay on EV for some relevant
; background.)  As is the case for EV, A-evaluation maps a term, alist, and
; latches to a (possibly multiple) value and new latches, but for A-evaluation
; there is a new wrinkle: for each function symbol f introduced for an abstract
; stobj in A that is bound in latches, the :EXEC definition of f is used
; (instead of the logical definition, which invokes the :LOGIC function).  If A
; is the empty set, then A-evaluation reduces to EV, and we call it
; pure-evaluation.  As with EV, A-evaluation comprehends guards and can return
; an error indication when there is a guard violation; and in that case, as
; with actual ACL2 evaluation, it must return such an error when latched stobjs
; are involved (even with guard-checking nil or :NONE).

; It is tempting to show a direct correspondence between pure-evaluation and
; A-evaluation, where A is the set of abstract stobj names.  But we will
; instead define a sort of "dual-rail" evaluator that does both of these
; together, because we need those two evaluations to stop at the same time in
; order to compare their returned latches.  Now, it is possible to show that
; A-evaluation continues for at _least_ as long as pure-evaluation, by applying
; the :GUARD-THM theorems when comparing a :LOGIC function call during
; pure-evaluation with a corresponding :EXEC function call during A-evaluation.
; But A-evaluation could run longer, so we need a way to stop it at the point
; that pure-evaluation stops, in order to compare the returned latches for
; each.  Before we define our dual-rail evaluator, we need a few definitions.

; For a set A of abstract stobj names, an alist S is A-valid if for every stobj
; name s0 in the domain of S: if s0 is in A then S(s0) satisfies the :EXEC
; recognizer for s0, and otherwise S(s0) satisfies the recognizer for s0
; (hence, the :LOGIC recognizer for s0 if s0 is an abstract stobj).  We may say
; ``valid'' in place of ``A-valid'' if A is clear from context or
; ``pure-valid'' if A is the empty set.

; For a given abstract stobj s0, two ACL2 objects x$c and x$a are said to
; s0-correspond (or, just "correspond" if s0 is clear from context) if
; corr(x$c,x$a) holds, where corr is the (ordinary logical interpretation of
; the) :CORR-FN for s0.  Let A be a set of abstract stobj names and let S$c and
; S$a be alists.  We say that S$c and S$a A-correspond if they have the same
; domain and for every x in their domain: if x is in A then S$c(x) and S$a(x)
; correspond, and otherwise S$c(x) = S$a(x).  In the context of an expected
; stobjs-out, two results A-correspond if they have the same number of values
; and for each position n, if the nth element of the stobjs-out is some s0 in A
; then the respective nth values s0-correspond, and otherwise the respective
; nth values are equal.

; We are ready to model dual-rail evaluation with a function ev5.

;   (ev5 term alist$c alist$a latches$c latches$a A)
;   =
;   (mv erp result$c result$a latches$c' latches$a')

; The definition of EV5 (details omitted here) is, with two exceptions
; discussed below, a straightforward modification of EV for a dual-rail
; semantics, i.e., returning the results of A-evaluation (result$c and
; latches$c') and pure-evaluation (result$a and latches$a').  The first
; exception is that guards are checked only for pure-evaluation.  The second
; exception pertains to any call of a primitive for an abstract stobj in A that
; is bound in latches$c (or equivalently, in latches$a).  In that case,
; A-evaluation and pure-evaluation are used independently on the :EXEC and
; :LOGIC functions for the primitive, respectively, to compute the result pairs
; <result$c,latches$c'> and <result$a,latches$a'>, respectively).  We argue
; below that both of these evaluations occur without guard violations.

; The following correctness claim justifies the use of concrete stobjs to
; simulate evaluation with abstract stobjs.

;   Claim.  Let A be a set of abstract stobj names, and let u be a term.  Also
;   let S$c and S$a be A-corresponding alists that are A-valid and pure-valid,
;   respectively, with a common domain that includes all free variables of u.
;   Let L$c and L$a be the respective restrictions of S$c and S$a to a common
;   set of stobj names, and assume that A is a subset of the common domain of
;   L$c and L$a.  Assume either of the following, where EV_A is the variant of
;   EV that evaluates using :EXEC functions in the case of stobj primitives for
;   members of A.

;   (a) (ev_A u S$c L$c) = (mv erp r$c L$c')
;       AND
;       (ev   u S$a L$a) = (mv nil r$a L$a')
;   OR
;   (b) (ev5 u S$c S$a L$c L$a A) = (mv erp r$c r$a L$c' L$a').

;   Then the following properties hold.

;   (1) In case (b) with erp nil, and in case (a) (for any erp):
;       (i)  r$c A-corresponds to r$a if r is in A, else r$c = r$a; and
;       (ii) L$c' and L$a' are the respective updates of L$c and L$a
;            according to r$c, r$a, and the stobjs-out of u, in the obvious
;            sense.
;   (2) L$c', L$a', L$c, and (thus) L$a all have the same domain.
;   (3) L$c' A-corresponds to L$a'.
;   (4) L$c' is A-valid and L$a' is pure-valid.
;   (5) In case (a), erp is nil.

; Remark.  The subset restriction does not impair the relevance of this Claim.
; In an actual evaluation in the top-level loop, consider the latches as
; including a binding for every known stobj name that occurs in the term to be
; evaluated.  Local stobjs and stobj-let-bound stobjs don't present a problem,
; since each will add a binding to the latches; but we ignore these for the
; proof.

; Proof.  This is a reasonably obvious theorem, since the proof obligations for
; a defabsstobj event provide the necessary preservation of stobj recognizers
; and concrete/abstract correspondences.  Below we give only an outline of a
; proof, first dealing with (a) by itself, then using (a) in the proof sketch
; for (b).

; The proof of (a) is by induction on A.  First consider the base case, where A
; is empty.  Clearly (1)(i), (3), and (5) hold vacuously.  Parts (1)(ii) and
; (2) are just facts about EV.  Finally, (4) reduces to showing that L$a' is
; pure-valid.  This follows from the :PRESERVED theorems, each of which has a
; stobj primitive guard as a hypothesis, and the fact that EV returns an error
; (mv non-nil ...) when the guard doesn't hold for a call of a stobj primitive.
; We omit details.

; So assume that A is non-empty.  Let s0 be the abstract stobj in A that was
; last introduced in the world.  Hence we may write A = A' U {s0} where by the
; inductive hypothesis, the claim holds for A'.

; We now proceed by computational induction.  We consider only the interesting
; case, leaving the rest to the reader: u is (f ... s0 ...), where f is a stobj
; primitive for s0 (whose arguments may include members of A'), and where the
; arguments evaluate without error.  Let f$a and f$c be the :LOGIC and :EXEC
; functions for f (respectively).  For notational simplicity we consider only
; the case that f returns a single value; the general case is really the same,
; except for focusing on a particular position's result.  Let r' be the result
; of pure-evaluation of (f$c ... s0 ...), i.e., of (ev u$c S$a L$a) where u$c
; is this call of f$c.  We make the following two observations, each followed
; by a justification.

; (*)   r' {s0}-corresponds to r$a.

; To see this, first note that since we are assuming that the evaluation (ev u
; S$a L$a) does not result in an error, i.e., returns (mv nil ...), we know
; that the guard of f is met for this application of f.  We may therefore apply
; the :CORRESPONDENCE theorem for f, to conclude that (f$c ... s0 ...) and (f$a
; ... s0 ...) {s0}-correspond.  But these are respectively equal to r' and r$a,
; by definition of r' and r$a.

; (**)  r$c A'-corresponds to r'.

; This holds by the inductive hypothesis on A', since A'-evaluation of the body
; of f$c produces the same result as A-evaluation of the body of f$c (namely,
; r$c), as no primitive function for s0 is ancestral in f$c (because f$c was
; defined before the introduction of abstract stobj s0).

; From (*) and (**), a case analysis on which stobj, if any, is returned by f,
; yields that r$c A-corresponds to r$a.  Conclusion (1)(i) follows, and
; (1)(ii), (2), and (3) then follow by usual arguments for EV.  For (5), we
; observe that since the guard holds for the call of f (as argued for (*)
; above)), then by the :GUARD-THM theorems, the guard holds for the
; corresponding call of f$c; hence since f$c is guard-verified, its call's
; A-evaluation concludes without error.  For (4), we simply note that the
; :LOGIC recognizers are preserved by the :PRESERVED theorems, and then the
; :EXEC recognizers are preserved by the :CORRESPONDENCE theorems because the
; call of f$c is well-guarded, as argued for (5) above.

; That concludes the proof of case (a), so we now consider case (b).  The proof
; is by computational induction.  The interesting case is the same one we dealt
; with in the proof of case (a).  In case (b), EV5 first checks the guard for
; pure evaluation before passing control to EV_A and EV, passing up (mv erp
; ...) with erp non-nil if the check fails; and in that case we simply appeal
; to the inductive hypothesis.  But if the guard-check succeeds, then since f
; is guard-verified, we know that there will be no guard violation, and
; pure-evaluation (EV) will return with erp = nil.  So we can apply case (a),
; completing the proof.

; Note: the argument above probably works if we support specification of an
; arbitrary guard for a function exported by defabsstobj instead of using the
; guard of its :logic function.  If the need for such flexibility arises
; (presumably in the form of a new :guard keyword for defabsstobj :exports), we
; should revisit this Essay in order to be sure that the argument holds
; together.  But careful: allowing an arbitrary guard might not be feasible!  A
; comment in update-guard-post explains that substituting exported functions
; for their :logic versions has the property that guard proof obligations are
; essentially preserved.  But the use of user-supplied guards destroys that
; argument, and as a result, we no longer can trust evaluation of the guard in
; raw Lisp.

; Essay on Nested Stobjs

; After Version_6.1 we introduced a new capability: allowing fields of stobjs
; to themselves be stobjs or arrays of stobjs.  Initially we resisted this idea
; because of an aliasing problem, which we review now, as it is fundamental to
; understanding our implementation.

; Consider the following events.

;   (defstobj st fld)
;   (defstobj st2 (fld2 :type st))

; Now suppose we could evaluate the following code, to be run immediately after
; admitting the two defstobj events above.

;   (let* ((st (fld2 st2))
;          (st (update-fld 3 st)))
;     (mv st st2))

; A reasonable raw-Lisp implementation of nested stobjs, using destructive
; updates, could be expected to have the property that for the returned st and
; st2, st = (fld2 st2) and thus (fld (fld2 st2)) = (fld st) = 3.  However,
; under an applicative semantics, st2 has not changed and thus, logically, it
; follows that (fld (fld2 st2)) has its original value of nil, not 3.

; In summary, a change to st can cause a logically-inexplicable change to st2.
; But this problem can also happen in reverse: a change to st2 can cause a
; logically-inexplicable change to st.  Consider evaluation of the following
; code, to be run immediately after admitting the two defstobj events above.

;   (let ((st2 (let* ((st (fld2 st2))
;                     (st (update-fld 3 st)))
;                (update-fld2 st st2))))
;     (mv st st2))

; With destructive updates in raw Lisp, we expect that st = (fld2 st2) for the
; returned st and st2, and thus (fld st) = (fld (fld2 st2)) = 3.  But
; logically, the returned st is as initially created, and hence (fld st) =
; nil.

; One can imagine other kinds of aliasing problems; imagine putting a single
; stobj into two different slots of a parent stobj.

; Therefore, we carefully control access to stobj fields of stobjs by
; introducing a new construct, stobj-let.  Consider for example the following
; events.

; (defstobj st1 ...)
; (defstobj st2 ...)
; (defstobj st3 ...)
; (defstobj st+
;           (fld1 :type st1)
;           (fld2 :type st2)
;           (fld3 :type (array st3 (8))))

; If producer and consumer are functions, then we can write the following
; form.  Note that stobj-let takes four "arguments": bindings, producer
; variables, a producer form, and a consumer form.

;   (stobj-let
;    ((st1 (fld1 st+))
;     (st2 (fld2 st+))
;     (st3 (fld3i 4 st+)))
;    (x st1 y st3 ...) ; producer variables
;    (producer st1 st2 st3 ...)
;    (consumer st+ x y ...))

; Updater names need to be supplied if not the default.  Thus, the form above
; is equivalent to the following.

;   (stobj-let
;    ((st1 (fld1 st+) update-fld1)
;     (st2 (fld2 st+) update-fld2)
;     (st3 (fld3i 4 st+) update-fld3i))
;    (x st1 y st3 ...) ; producer variables
;    (producer st1 st2 st3 ...)
;    (consumer st+ x y ...))

; The form above expands as follows in the logic (or at least, essentially so).
; The point is that we avoid the aliasing problem: there is no direct access to
; the parent stobj when running the producer, which is updated to stay in sync
; with updates to the child stobjs; and there is no direct access to the child
; stobjs when running the consumer.  Note that since st2 is not among the
; producer variables, fld2 is not updated.

;   (let ((st1 (fld1 st+))
;         (st2 (fld2 st+))
;         (st3 (fld3i 4 st+)))
;     (declare (ignorable st1 st2 st3)) ; since user has no way to do this
;     (mv-let (x st1 y st3 ...) ; producer variables
;             (check-vars-not-free (st+)
;                                  (producer st1 st2 st3 ...))
;             (let* ((st+ (update-fld1 st1 st+))
;                    (st+ (update-fld3i 4 st3 st+)))
;               (check-vars-not-free (st1 st2 st3)
;                                    (consumer st+ x y ...)))))

; We consider next whether the use of check-vars-not-free truly prevents access
; to a stobj named in its variable list (first argument).  For example, if
; <form> is the stobj-let form displayed above, might we let-bind foo to st+
; above <form> and then reference foo in the producer?  Such aliasing is
; prevented (or had better be!) by our implementation; in general, we cannot
; have two variables bound to the same stobj, or there would be logical
; problems: changes to a stobj not explained logically (because they result
; from destructive changes to a "copy" of the stobj that is really EQ to the
; original stobj).  On first glance, one might wonder if support for congruent
; stobjs could present a problem, for example as follows.  Suppose that
; function h is the identity function that maps stobj st1 to itself, suppose
; that st2 is a stobj congruent to st1, and consider the form (let ((st2 (h
; st1))) <term>).  If such a form could be legal when translating for execution
; (which is the only way live stobjs can be introduced), then the aliasing
; problem discussed above could arise, because st2 is bound to st1 and <term>
; could mention both st1 and st2.  But our handling of congruent stobjs allows
; h to map st1 to st2 and also to map st2 to st2, but not to map st1 to st2.
; There are comments about aliasing in the definitions of translate11-let and
; translate11-mv-let.

; In the bindings, an index in an array access must be a symbol or a (possibly
; quoted) natural number -- after all, there would be a waste of computation
; otherwise, since we do updates at the end.  For each index that is a
; variable, it must not be among the producer variables, to prevent its capture
; in the generated updater call.

; Of course, we make other checks too: for example, all of the top-level
; let-bound stobj fields must be distinct stobj variables that suitably
; correspond to distinct field calls on the same concrete (not abstract) stobj.
; (If we want to relax that restriction, we need to think very carefully about
; capture issues.)

; In raw Lisp, the expansion avoids the expense of binding st+ to the updates,
; or even updating st+ at all, since the updates to its indicated stobj fields
; are all destructive.  IGNORE declarations take the place of those updates.
; And the update uses let* instead of let at the top level, since (at least in
; CCL) that adds efficiency.

;   (let* ((st1 (fld1 st+))
;          (st2 (fld2 st+))
;          (st3 (fld3i 4 st+)))
;     (declare (ignorable st1 st2 st3))
;     (mv-let (x st1 y st3 ...)
;             (producer st1 st2 st3 ...)
;             (declare (ignore st1 st3))
;             (consumer st+ x y ...)))

; Note that bound variables of a stobj-let form must be unique.  Thus, if the
; parent stobj has two fields of the same stobj type, then they cannot be bound
; by the same stobj-let form unless different variables are used.  This may be
; possible, since stobj-let permits congruent stobjs in the bindings.  For
; example, suppose that we started instead with these defstobj events.

; (defstobj st1 ...)
; (defstobj st2 ... :congruent-to st1)
; (defstobj st3 ...)
; (defstobj st+
;           (fld1 :type st1)
;           (fld2 :type st1)
;           (fld3 :type (array st3 (8))))

; Then we can write the same stobj-let form as before.  ACL2 will check that
; st2 is congruent to the type of fld2, which is st1.

; The discussion above assumes that there are at least two producer variables
; for a stobj-let.  However, one producer variable is permitted, which
; generates a LET in place of an MV-LET.  For example, consider the following.

;   (stobj-let
;    ((st1 (fld1 st+))
;     (st2 (fld2 st+))
;     (st3 (fld3i 4 st+)))
;    (st1) ; producer variable
;    (producer st1 st2 st3 ...)
;    (consumer st+ x y ...))

; Here is the translation in the logic.

;   (let ((st1 (fld1 st+))
;         (st2 (fld2 st+))
;         (st3 (fld3 st+)))
;     (declare (ignorable st1 st2 st3))
;     (let ((st1 (check-vars-not-free (st+)
;                                     (producer st1 st2 st3 ...))))
;       (let* ((st+ (update-fld1 st1 st+)))
;         (check-vars-not-free (st1 st2 st3)
;                              (consumer st+ x y ...)))))

; For simplicity, each binding (in the first argument of stobj-let) should be
; for a stobj field.

; We had the following concern about *1* code generated for updaters of stobjs
; with stobj fields.  Oneify-cltl-code generates a check for *1* updater calls,
; for whether a stobj argument is live.  But should we consider the possibility
; that one stobj argument is live and another stobj argument is not?
; Fortunately, that's not an issue: if one stobj argument is live, then we are
; running code, in which case translate11 ensures that all stobj arguments are
; live.

; Here's the idea.  Both showing and using of rewrites benefits from knowing

; will try to do more, namely relieve all the hyps by instantiating free
; variables.  So we avoid doing any instantiation in forming the sar record.
; Actually, if we knew that rewriting were to be done with the empty
; substitution, then we'd go ahead and store the result of trying to relieve
; hypotheses at this point; but we don't.  Nevertheless, we should have a
; function that takes the fields of an sar record and returns an appropriate
; structure representing the result of trying to relieve the hyps (possibly
; starting with a unify-subst extending the one that was originally produced).

; Essay on Include-book-dir-alist

; ACL2 supports two alists that associate keywords with absolute directory
; pathnames, to be used as values of the :dir argument of include-book and ld:
; the include-book-dir!-table, and the :include-book-dir-alist field of the
; acl2-defaults-table.  The macros add-include-book-dir and
; add-include-book-dir! provide ways to extend these alists to allow additional
; legal values for :dir.  Up through ACL2 Version_3.6.1, when
; add-include-book-dir was executed in raw Lisp it would be ignored, because it
; macroexpanded to a table event.  But consider a file loaded in raw Lisp, say
; when we are in raw-mode and are executing an include-book command with a :dir
; argument.  If that :dir value were defined by an add-include-book-dir event
; also evaluated in raw Lisp, and hence ignored, then that :dir value would not
; really be defined after all and the include-book would fail.

; The above problem with raw-mode could be explained away by saying that
; raw-mode is a hack, and you get what you get.  But Version_4.0 introduced the
; loading of compiled files before corresponding event processing, which causes
; routine evaluation of add-include-book-dir, add-include-book-dir!, and
; include-book in raw Lisp.

; Therefore we maintain for raw Lisp variants of these two alists: state
; globals 'raw-include-book-dir-alist and 'raw-include-book-dir!-alist.  The
; values of these variables are initially :ignore, meaning that we are to use
; the two tables, not the state globals.  But when the values are not :ignore,
; then they are alists to use in place of the corresponding table values.  We
; guarantee that every embedded event form that defines handling of :dir values
; for include-book does so in a manner that works when loading compiled files,
; and we weakly extend this guarantee to raw-mode as well (weakly, since we
; cannot perfectly control raw-mode; but a trust tag is necessary to enter
; raw-mode so our guarantee need not be ironclad).  The above :ignore value
; must then be set to a legitimate include-book-alist when inside include-book
; or (ideally) in raw-mode, and should remain :ignore when not in those
; contexts.  When the value of 'raw-include-book-dir-alist is not :ignore, then
; execution of add-include-book-dir will extend the value of
; 'raw-include-book-dir-alist instead of modifying the acl2-defaults-table.
; Whenever we execute include-book in raw Lisp, we use this value instead of
; the one in the acl2-defaults-table, by binding it to nil upon entry.  Thus,
; any add-include-book-dir will be local to the book, which respects the
; semantics of include-book.  We bind it to nil because that is also how
; include-book works: the acl2-defaults-table initially has an empty
; :include-book-dir-alist field (see process-embedded-events).  Of course,
; add-include-book-dir! corresponds to the include-book-dir!-table, not to the
; acl2-defaults-table, and its effect is not local to a book.  Thus, we handle
; 'raw-include-book-dir!-alist a bit differently from how we handle
; 'raw-include-book-dir-alist, though similarly: we bind it to nil in
; include-book-raw-top, at the top level of the entry into raw Lisp (for early
; load of compiled files) from include-book, bindings state global
; 'raw-include-book-dir!-alist to the current value of the
; include-book-dir!-table.

; In order to be able to rely on the above scheme, we disallow any direct table
; update of the include-book-dir!-table or of the :include-book-dir-alist field
; of the acl2-defaults-table.  We use the state global
; 'modifying-include-book-dir-alist for this purpose, which is globally nil but
; is bound to t by add-include-book-dir and related macros.  We insist that it
; be non-nil in chk-table-guard.  We considered making such a check instead in
; chk-embedded-event-form, but that would have been more awkward, and more
; importantly, it would have allowed such direct updates when developing a book
; interactively but not when certifying the book, which could provide a rude

; Although this function is generally only called with #+hons, nevertheless we

; hons and non-hons versions of ACL2.

; The usual table guard mechanism provides crude error messages when there is a
; violation.  We avoid that problem by causing a hard error.  We rely on the
; fact that illegal and hard-error return nil.

; The memoize-table maps :common-lisp-compliant function symbols (to be
; memoized or unmemoized) to nil (unmemoized) or to a non-empty alist that
; stores relevant information, such as the condition (see memoize-form).  The
; guard requirement then ensures that when we call the raw Lisp version of fn,
; then since the guard for fn must hold in that case, so does the guard for
; condition-fn.  The body of condition-fn can therefore be called in raw Lisp
; on the arguments of any call of fn made in raw Lisp from the ACL2
; read-eval-print loop.  This is important because the memoized function body
; includes code from the body of condition-fn.

; Essay on Defattach

; In this essay we discuss both the implementation of defattach and its logical
; characterization.

; We begin this essay with some terminology, starting with concepts that
; permeate logic and ACL2 and then defattach-specific notions.

; Theory:  a deductively closed set of first-order sentences

; Chronology: a sequence of events that is admissible by ACL2 (but here
; ignoring table events and other extra-logical events)

; History: a subsequence of a chronology consisting of axiomatic events (defun,
; defchoose, non-trivial encapsulate, defaxiom)

; Theory (of a chronology or of a history): The obvious extension of the idea
; of the theory of a set of first order sentences.  Every (logical) event
; naturally corresponds to a first-order sentence; the theory of a chronology
; or history is just its deductive closure (viewing a sequence as a set).  If
; ACL2 is sound then the theory of a chronology is the same as the theory of
; the corresponding history: that is, the non-axiomatic events of a chronology
; are all first-order provable from its axiomatic events.

; Standard Model: The standard model of Peano axioms is the set of natural
; numbers together with the usual operators.  In particular, there are no
; objects in the standard model that don't correspond with some natural, e.g.,
; there is no object having an infinite number of predecessors as one could
; arrange by adding the consistent infinite set of axioms of the form n < C,
; for every natural number n.  The standard model of ACL2 is just Common Lisp
; on a machine with unlimited memory and no ``bad atoms,'' e.g., the only
; objects in the model are the objects you can type in.

; Substitution (of a defattach event): We refer to the "substitution of"
; a defattach event, i.e. its "attachment substitution" or "attachment-alist",
; as the functional substitution specified in the event.  An "attachment pair"
; <f,g> is an ordered pair of function symbols f and g such that g is the
; "current attachment" of f: that is, <f,g> is a pair from the substitution of
; a defattach event active in the current ACL2 world.  If <f.g> is an
; attachment pair, then the corresponding "attachment axiom" is defined to be
; the formula (equal (f x1 ... xk) (g x1 ... xk)), where the xi are the formals
; of f.  When we treat this attachment axiom as an event, we consider it
; logically to be a defun event that introduces f, in an "evaluation history"
; as described below.  Note that we only admit attachment pairs <f,g> with the
; same signatures (up to renaming of formals).

; In what follows we allow defaxiom events.  However, we insist on the
; following

; Defaxiom Restriction for Defattach: no ancestor (according to the
; transitive closure of the immediate-supporter relation) of a defaxiom event
; has an attachment.

; Most of the focus in this essay is on logical issues related to defattach,
; but we first say a few words about the implementation.

; In one sense we must disallow attachments to functions introduced by defun,
; since we need to generate our own defuns for attachable functions.  We can
; allow such attachments for logical purposes, however.  Consider the following
; silly example.

; (defstub f (x) t)
; (defun g (x)
;   (f x))
; (encapsulate ((h (x) t))
;   (local (defun h (x) (g x)))
;   (defthm h-prop
;     (equal (h x) (g x))))

; Imagine attaching acl2-numberp to f and also to h.  Our proof obligations are
; obtained by applying the attachment substitution to the conjunction of the
; constraints on f and h, in this case (equal (h x) (g x)).  Thus we must prove
; (equal (acl2-numberp x) (g x)) in the current ACL2 world.  But in that world
; we do not know that g is acl2-numberp.  The solution is to attach
; acl2-numberp to g as well (which also forces the definitional equation of g
; to be added to the constraints which must be instantiated and proved).
; Defattach has a syntax, :attach nil, that specifies that an attachment is not
; to be installed for execution even though the attachment pair is recorded for
; the defattach; and that syntax would need to be used in the case of g.

; Thus, we only allow attachments for execution to functions introduced in
; signatures of encapsulate events.  (We do not expect attachments to defchoose
; functions, which can be simulated anyhow by using suitable wrappers.  But if
; such support becomes necessary, then we can probably provide it.)

; Of course, users can experiment with defattach without concern for proof
; obligations, by wrapping skip-proofs around defattach events.

; Since ACL2 supports two theories -- the current theory and its corresponding
; evaluation theory (described below) -- we add an argument to all ev functions
; (ev-w, ev-fncall, etc.), aok, specifying whether or not to use attachments.
; We will tend to use attachments at the top level but not in logical contexts,
; hence not under waterfall-step except in subroutines where it is again
; appropriate, such as evaluation of syntaxp expressions (ev-synp), meta rules,
; and clause-processor rules (see the Essay on Correctness of Meta Reasoning).
; Note that ev-fncall-rec-logical really needs this information.  With this
; fine-grained control of which of the two theories to use, we can for example
; arrange that mfc-rewrite behave the same inside syntaxp as does rewrite (at
; the top level), as suggested by Robert Krug.

; We next describe the implementation of defattach as an event.  In particular:
; Why is it a separate event type, rather than a macro that generates some
; other kind of event?

; We first considered following the precedent of :induction rules, using
; defthm.  But the user might find it unintuitive if defattach were skipped in
; :program mode, yet defthm is so skipped.  Moreover, we expected to generate
; Lisp code to do the attachment, but defthm doesn't generate any 'cltl-command
; property.

; We thus tentatively decided to implement defattach as a table event.  As a
; bonus, implementing defattach as a table event meant that we could follow the
; precedent of memoize/unmemoize.

; However, using a table event would be awkward.  If several attachments are
; made together (say, because several functions share a single constraint),
; then in order to remove one of those attachments, soundness demands that we
; remove them all.  (For, why did we require them all to be attached together
; in the first place?  Perhaps because we needed all those instantiations to be
; made together in order to prove the instantiated constraint.)  So undoing
; can't be done one function at a time, really; it needs to be atomic.  That
; could be managed, but it "feels" like it could potentially be awkward with
; table events.

; A bigger concern is that through Version_3.6.1, table events have not
; involved proof obligations, as indicated by a comment at the top of table-fn.
; Even merely expressing proof obligations in the language of tables seems
; awkward, unless perhaps we explicitly name each theorem that must be proved
; and refer to it by name in the table event.  And note that although we can do
; some fancy things within the context of table events (for example memoize
; generates a 'cltl-command), it seems much simpler not to have to do so in
; this case.

; It seems more natural, then, to invent a new event to handle attachment,
; rather than having defattach be a macro that expands to an existing event.
; At the time we started our implementation of defattach, there seemed to be
; fewer than 40 occurrences of set-body in the code, as determined by:
;   fgrep -i set-body /projects/acl2/devel/saved/*.lisp | wc -l
; So, we used set-body as a model for adding a new event.

; In general, we pick a canonical representative for the set of function
; symbols to which a defattach event is making attachments; call that
; representative f.  Then the 'attachment property of f is an alist matching
; function symbols to their attachments (including f); but the other function
; symbols in the nest have an 'attachment property of f -- reminiscent of
; handling of the 'constraint-lst property.  We maintain the invariant that for
; every function symbol g with an attachment h to its code, g is associated
; with h using the lookup method described above: if g is associated with an
; alist then h is the result of looking up g in that alist, else g is
; associated with a "canonical" symbol g' that is associated with an alist
; associating g with h.  (Note that this notion of "canonical" is not related
; to the notion of "canonical sibling", described elsewhere.)

; Turning now to logical issues:

; The fundamental guiding notion is that the attachment pairs extend the
; session's set of axioms to form what we call the "evaluation theory".  We say
; more about this theory (and its consistency) below.  But we also want to
; support the use of defattach for specifying refinements, with the following
; understanding: "refinement" means that the new function definitions, together
; with the attachment axioms, extend the current theory (to the evaluation
; theory), and this extension remains consistent, indeed with a standard model
; if there are no defaxiom events.  Moreover, it would be a kindness to the
; user if whenever an attachment substitution is subsequently used for
; functional instantiation, the resulting proof obligations generated are all
; dispatched without proof because they were cached at the time the defattach
; event was admitted.  However, we do not restrict the design to ensure
; definitively that this "kindness" must take place.

; Our logical characterization is based on the idea of an "evaluation theory",
; obtained by extending the current theory with the attachment axiom for each
; attachment pair.  We show that evaluation in the top-level loop is performed
; with respect to the evaluation theory.  Below we also show -- and this is
; where most of our effort lies -- that the evaluation theory is consistent,
; assuming that there are no defaxiom events in the current history.  More
; generally, we show that the evaluation theory is contained in the theory of a
; "evaluation history" containing no new defaxiom events, which replaces
; constraints in the original history by attachment axioms.  Consider the
; following example (which ignores the issue of guards):

; (encapsulate ((f1 (x) t))
;              (local (defun f1 (x) x)))
;              (defthm f1-property
;                (consp (f1 (cons x x)))))
; (defun g1 (x)
;   (if (consp x) x (cons x x)))
; (defattach f1 g1)

; Then the corresponding evaluation history could be as follows, where we
; ignore the defattach event itself.

; (defun g1 (x)
;   (if (consp x) x (cons x x)))
; (defun f1 (x)
;   (g1 x))

; Of course, we could then prove that the original constraint holds for f1.

; (defthm f1-property
;   (consp (f1 (cons x x))))

; Indeed, that is critical: in order to show that the theory of the evaluation
; history extends that of the original history, we must guarantee that the
; original constraints on attached functions (hence on f1 in the example above)
; are provable in the evaluation history.  In the example above, notice that we
; have replaced the constraint of f1 by its definition using the attachment
; axiom.  The property exported from the original encapsulation on f1 now
; becomes a top-level theorem, which is provable because (consp (g1 (cons x
; x))) is provable, as this is the proof obligation generated by the defattach,
; and g1 and f1 are provably equal by the attachment axiom.

; But we must be careful.  Consider for example:

; (encapsulate ((f1 (x) t))
;              (local (defun f1 (x) x)))
; (defun g1 (x)
;   (not (f1 x)))
; (defattach f1 g1)

; Of course, g1 satisfies the constraint on f1, which is trivial.  Also notice
; that we can prove (thm (not (equal (f1 x) (g1 x)))) before the defattach
; event.  Yet after the defattach, (equal (f1 x) (g1 x)) is a theorem of the
; evaluation theory.

; This example motivates an acyclicity condition on functions and their
; attachments, explained below, that is sufficient for supporting a
; characterization of defattach events in terms of evaluation histories.  We
; next provide some motivation, before presenting the appropriate foundational
; theory.

; Consider first a defattach event that attaches certain gi to fi, where the fi
; are all the functions introduced by some individual encapsulate event and the
; gi are all defined before that encapsulate.  Imagine replacing the
; encapsulate by the attachment axioms discussed above, i.e., defining each fi
; to be the corresponding gi.  Before such replacement, the encapsulate's
; constraint is guaranteed to hold of the gi by our conditions for admitting
; the defattach event; therefore the original constraint on the fi trivially
; holds when we replace the encapsulate by these attachment axioms.  Thus, the
; replacement of the encapsulate by the attachment axioms gives us a stronger
; theory than the original theory; so it's pretty clear that the events after
; the encapsulate remain admissible after that replacement -- not that the ACL2
; prover could actually dispatch all proof obligations, but that all proof
; obligations are indeed theorems, since the history's axiom base has been
; strengthened.

; But in general, the gi might be defined *after* introduction of the
; corresponding fi.  For example, one can imagine that f1 is the :logic mode
; built-in function symbol too-many-ifs and g1 is defined by a user (much
; later) to be an efficient implementation.  Notice that in the first example
; displayed above, the definition of g1 could presumably have been made before
; f1, while that is not the case in the second (problematic) example above.

; Thus, although we need not insist that each gi be introduced before fi, we do
; insist that the definition of gi can be relocated to occur before the
; introduction of fi.  We thus provide a criterion that considers gi to be an
; "extended ancestor" of fi, the motivating idea being that gi is an ancestor
; (supporter) of fi in the evaluation history (because gi supports the
; definition of fi in the attachment axiom for <fi,gi>) and to insist that this
; extended ancestor relation is cycle-free.  More details are provided in the
; foundational theory presented below and considered at length in the Essay on
; Merging Attachment Records.

; Of course, if the acyclicity check succeeds then it continues to succeed when
; we remove attachment pairs.  But suppose one defattach event attaches to f1
; and f2 while a second attaches to f1 and f3.  It would be a mistake to leave
; the attachment of f2 in place when attaching to f1 and f3, as illustrated by
; the following example.  For simplicity, we abuse notation a little, sometimes
; writing a zero-ary function symbol, f, to denote a constant, (f), and
; sometimes writing a constant, e.g. 0, to denote a zero-ary function returning
; that value.

; (defstub f1 ...)
; constrain f2=f1
; constrain f3=f1
; (defattach ((f1 0) (f2 0)))
; (defattach ((f1 1) (f3 1)))

; If we don't eliminate the attachment to f2 when carrying out the second
; defattach, then we are left with the following, which violates the constraint
; f2=f1!

; f1=1
; f2=0
; f3=1

; We now make a more careful argument that the evaluation theory is contained
; in the theory of some so-called evaluation history.  To recap: We have
; specified that in order for a defattach event to be admissible, then if C is
; the conjunction of the constraints on the attached functions, the functional
; instance C\s must be a theorem, where s is the set of attachment pairs
; specified by the event.  We have also discussed the requirement for
; acyclicity of an extended ancestors relation; so next, we turn to specifying
; that relation precisely.  We begin by making a couple of remarks.  Note first
; that our arguments below will involve permuting top-level events.  We thus
; prefer not to think about events other than those at the top level, and we
; disallow defattach events except at the top-level; they are illegal inside
; non-trivial encapsulates.  We also assume the absence of trivial encapsulates
; and include-book forms, which can be replaced by the individual events
; within.

; Note that acyclicity checking is necessary even during the include-book pass
; of certify-book (and similarly by any include-book, though we restrict
; attention here to the former case).  Consider the following example.

; (defattach f ...) ; first defattach
; (local (defattach f ...)) ; second defattach
; (defattach ...) ; third defattach

; If the first and third defattach events interact to form a loop, but the
; second and third do not, then the first pass of book certification would not
; catch a loop, but the include-book pass would encounter a loop that needs to
; be detected.

; Acyclicity checking will be unnecessary when including a certified book in a
; world where there are no defattach events outside the boot-strap world,
; because the necessary acyclicity checks for the book's defattach events were
; already made when certifying the book, during its include-book pass.  (At the
; time of this writing, however, no such optimization is implemented.)  But
; otherwise, we need to do an acyclicity check for the defattach events
; encountered while including a book.  The following example illustrates why
; this is necessary.  Imagine that we have two books, each containing the
; following events.

; (defstub g () t)
; (defun h () (not (g)))
; (defstub f () t)

; Now suppose one of the books concludes with the event

; (defattach f h)

; while the other concludes with the event

; (defattach g f).

; Although each book is individually certifiable, it is logically unsound to
; include both in the same session, since the resulting evaluation theory would
; equate g and h (as both are equated to f), and hence be inconsistent.  Of
; course, the extended ancestors relation in this case has a cycle: h supports
; f supports g supports h.

; Our acyclicity check will be made for the following binary relation.  Recall
; the immediate ancestors relation between a function symbol f1 introduced by
; event E1 and a function symbol f2 introduced by a later event E2: f1 occurs
; in the formula of E2.  In this case we also say that E1 is an immediate
; ancestor of E2.  For purposes of our acyclicity check, we are also interested
; in the pair <g,f> if <f,g> is an (existing, or about-to-be-introduced)
; attachment pair.  (The intuition is that ultimately we will define f to be g,
; hence f will depend on g.)  We will refer to this relation as the "extended
; immediate ancestors relation".  (Note that the discussion about events above
; refers to defun, defattach, and non-trivial encapsulate events; in
; particular, we assume that E1 and E2 are not defattach events.)

; But we really want an ancestor relation on events.  So to be more precise, we
; consider f and g to be related by either relation above if they have siblings
; f' and g' (respectively) that are so related, where two function symbols are
; siblings if they are introduced in the same (encapsulate or mutual-recursion)
; event.  We mainly ignore this issue of siblings here, but it is central in
; the Essay on Merging Attachment Records.  In that essay we also discuss in
; some detail the extended ancestor relation, which is the transitive closure
; of the union of the ordinary and extended immediate ancestor relations.  In
; particular, we defer to that essay how we check for cycles.  In summary: our
; ancestor relation is essentially on encapsulate and definitional events.
; This is important for the argument below, in which we complete our ancestor
; relation on events to a total order, essentially rearranging events so that
; for attachment pair <f,g>, g is introduced before f.  Because we want to
; rearrange entire events, our notion of event ancestor incorporates mbe when
; relevant to evaluation (i.e., in defun bodies) and guards.  We could perhaps
; avoid considering guards, actually, were it not for the issue related to
; guards raised at the end of the Essay on Correctness of Meta Reasoning.

; Before leaving the notion of extended ancestor relation, we make the
; following claim.

;   Defaxiom Acyclicity Claim.  If the extended ancestor relation is acyclic
;   without considering defaxiom events, then it remains acyclic when taking
;   the transitive closure after including defaxiom events in the following
;   sense: every event depends on every earlier defaxiom event, and every
;   defaxiom event depends on all its immediate ancestors.

; Because of this claim, we check for acyclicity of the extended ancestor
; relation, R, without considering defaxiom events, but when we assume
; acyclicity of R, we include the extra dependencies for defaxiom events
; mentioned in the claim above.  We may say "(without defaxioms)" to refer to
; the version of the extended ancestor relation that does not include defaxiom
; events as above.

; To prove the claim, suppose for a contradiction that C is a cycle in the
; indicated extension for defaxiom events.  Since the extension is assumed
; acyclic before extending by defaxiom events, then C must go through an edge
; linking a defaxiom to a supporting function symbol, f.  But when we restrict
; C to start with f, we stay in the original ancestor relation, since no
; attached function is ancestral in any defaxiom, by the Defaxiom Restriction
; for Defattach (stated above).  Thus we have a cycle starting with f in the
; original ancestor relation (without extending for defaxiom events), a
; contradiction.

; We turn now to the promised logical characterization of defattach, deferring
; for several paragraphs the proof that it actually holds for admissible
; defattach events.

; The defattach events of a history extend its theory, T, to its corresponding
; "evaluation theory", T', whose axioms include T together with the attachment
; axioms: again, these are the definitions (f x1 ... xn) = (g x1 ... xn), as
; <f,g> ranges over all current attachment pairs.  We assume that the defattach
; events produce an acyclic extended ancestors relation.  A key desired
; property is as follows (see also the Evaluation History Theorem below for a
; sort of generalization).

;   Proposition (Attachment Consistency).  If a history is defaxiom-free,
;   then its evaluation theory is consistent and in fact has a standard model.

; (Note: For ACL2(r), we expect that the argument for the proposition is
; essentially unchanged except that a final step, providing a standard model,
; is of course removed.  Specifically, this proposition follows from the
; Evaluation History Theorem, as explained below, whose proof we expect goes
; through unchanged for ACL2(r).)

; What is the significance of the above proposition?  There are several
; answers, depending on our intended application of defattach.  If our
; motivation is testing, then we want to test in a model of the original
; theory; and that will be the case if we evaluate in an extension of that
; theory, which as explained in the next paragraph is the evaluation theory (as
; we evaluate f using g for each attachment pair <f,g>).  If our motivation is
; attachment to system code, then it's really the same answer: Our system code
; defines a theory of prover functions, such that every model of that theory is
; intended to be correct.  Finally, if the motivation is refinement, the idea
; is that our goal is to refine (extend) the original theory with increasingly
; strong axioms about functions; and each defattach will provide such an
; extension, so that the refinement provided by the final defattach event does
; so as well.  In all cases, the idea is that we originally specified a class
; of models, and defattach events merely shrink that class of models without
; making it empty (indeed, still including a standard model).

; We characterize the effect of defattach for evaluation in the ACL2 loop as
; follows: it takes place relative to the definitions in the current evaluation
; theory, where for each attachment pair <f,g>, the guard of f is defined to be
; the guard of g.  (Implementation note: *1*f may directly call *1*g, and f may
; directly call g, if f has attachment g.)  In particular, as with evaluation
; in the ACL2 loop in general: (a) there is never a guard violation in raw
; Lisp; and (b) if evaluation of a ground term u in the ACL2 loop returns a
; value v, then u=v is a theorem of the evaluation theory.  To see that the
; implementation guarantees this behavior, first note that for every attachment
; pair <f,g>, ACL2 insists that the guard of f logically implies the guard of
; g; hence if we replace the guard of f by the guard of g in every guard proof
; obligation, provability of the original guard proof obligation implies
; provability of this weaker, new guard proof obligation.  Another way of
; thinking about evaluation is that it takes place in the evaluation chronology
; but with the guard of f set to the guard of g; thus guard verification for
; the new definition of f (i.e., equating f with g) is trivial.

; To be more precise: The actual guard proof obligation is obtained from the
; basic one, described above, by applying the attachment substitution.  The
; argument above goes through unchanged, however, because for each attachment
; pair <f,g>, f and g are equal in the evaluation history.  In most cases we
; imagine that this remark doesn't apply, i.e., the attachment substitution
; does not hit the basic guard implications described above.  However, consider
; the case of a generic interpreter using function generic-good-statep as a
; guard, and a concrete interpreter (say, for the JVM) using function
; concrete-good-statep as a guard.  There is no reason to expect that
; generic-good-statep is stronger than (or in any way related to)
; concrete-good-statep; but the implication (implies (generic-good-statep x)
; (concrete-good-statep x)) becomes trivial when applying a functional
; substitution mapping generic-good-statep to concrete-good-statep.

; We refer below to the replacement of an encapsulate using attachment
; equations.  This refers to the process, for each function symbol being
; provided an attachment, of replacing the encapsulate with a sequence
; consisting first of attachment equations (as defun events) for each function
; f that is both attached and is introduced by the encapsulate, and then
; modifying the encapsulate by eliminating a part of it for each such symbol f
; as follows: remove f from the signature if it's present there, and otherwise
; remove the definition of f from the encapsulate.  (If the definition is via a
; sub-encapsulate, then this removal occurs recursively.)  If what is left of
; the encapsulate introduces any functions, then we apply the same argument
; showing that the constraint of the original encapsulate is provable in the
; evaluation theory, to conclude that the first pass of that encapsulate is
; provable; hence the remainder of that encapsulate is admissible in the
; evaluation chronology.

; The Attachment Consistency Proposition, above, is immediate from the
; following theorem.  Here, we say that a sequence of axiomatic events respects
; a binary relation on function symbols if whenever <f,g> is in the relation,
; the axiomatic event for f is introduced before the axiomatic event for g.

;   Theorem (Evaluation History).  Let h1 be a history, and fix legal
;   attachments for h1, that is: the extended ancestors relation is acyclic,
;   and no attached function is ancestral in any defaxiom.  Then there is a
;   permutation h2 of h1 that respects the extended dependency relation for h1.
;   Let h3 be obtained from any such h2 by replacing each attached encapsulate
;   using the attachment equations of an admissible defattach event.  Then h3
;   is a history whose theory is the evaluation theory for h1 with respect to
;   the given attachments, and whose syntactic dependency relation is the
;   extended dependency relation (without defaxioms) of h1 with respect to the
;   given attachments.

; Proof. The existence of h2 is immediate by completing the extended dependency
; relation to a total order.  So we focus on the claim that h3 is a history
; whose theory is the evaluation theory for h1.  Since h2 respects the extended
; dependency relation for h1, h3 is a weak history: roughly speaking, each
; function is introduced before it is used.  So our task is to show that all
; proof obligations are met for h3 and that its theory is the evaluation theory
; for h1 with respect to the given attachments.

; Since h2 respects the extended ancestors relation, h2 is a weak history.  To
; see that h2 is a history, it suffices to show that all proof obligations are
; met.  This is clear if there are no defaxiom events, because each initial
; segment of h2 forms a subset of (the events in) h1 that is closed under
; ancestors in h1.  The argument is similar even if there are defaxiom events,
; as follows.  Fix an event A in h2; we show that the proof obligations are met
; for A.  Let B be the predecessor of A in h2 (possibly A itself) that occurs
; latest in h1, and let let h1' be the predecessors of B (including B) in h1,
; and let h2' be the predecessors of A (including A) in h2.  It's easy to see
; that h2' is closed under ancestors in h1'; here we use the fact that h2 is
; closed under the version of the extended ancestors relation that includes
; defaxiom events (see the discussion around the Defaxiom Acyclicity Claim,
; above).  Since h1' is a history (as it is an initial segment of h1), then it
; conservatively extends h2', and thus the proof obligations are met for A as
; it sits in h2.

; We return now to the task of showing that proof obligations are met for
; events in h3.  It suffices to show that each replacement of an encapsulate by
; corresponding attachment equations, as described above, can only strengthen
; the theory.  So for E = E(f1,f2,...) an encapsulate replaced by the use of
; attachment equations A = {fi=gi}, we must show that for E' = E(g1,g2,...),
; the first pass of E' is provable from A together with the predecessors of E'
; in h3.  We induct on the length of h3, so it suffices by the inductive
; hypothesis to show that the first pass of E' is provable from A together with
; the predecessors of E in h2.  But this is obvious, since the first passes of
; E and E' are provably equal under A.

; We have shown that h3 is a history.  Clearly the theory of h3 is axiomatized
; by the theory of h1 together with the attachment equations, so the remaining
; properties of h3 are obvious. -|

; Note that since each defattach event's proof obligations are done without
; taking into account any attachment pairs outside those specified by the
; event, then we can delete any set of defattach events from the world and the
; result is still a legal set of defattach events (as acyclicity is of course
; preserved when we shrink a relation).  But we can do something else: we can
; restrict the set of attachments to any set closed under ancestors, and hence
; under that restriction we can even remove pairs within a single defattach
; event.  (As of this writing we don't support such removal, however, and
; perhaps we won't ever support it since the implementation is simpler for
; removing entire defattach events when we erase.)  A long comment in function
; chk-evaluator-use-in-rule takes advantage of this fact, which we now state
; and prove.

;   Attachment Restriction Lemma.  Let s0 be a set of attachment pairs and let
;   s1 be a subset of s0, such that every function symbol in the domain of s0
;   that is ancestral (including siblings, but ignoring defaxioms) in the
;   domain of s1 is also in the domain of s1.  Let C0 and C1 be the respective
;   lists of constraints on the domains of s0 and s1, and similarly G0 and G1
;   for guard proof obligations, and assume that the functional instances C0\s0
;   and G0\s0 are provable in the current history.  Then C1\s1 and G1\s1 are
;   also provable in the current history.

; Proof: Note that every function symbol occurring in the constraint or guard
; obligation for attaching to a function symbol, f, is ancestral in f
; (syntactically ancestral, ignoring defaxioms, as defaxioms are not considered
; when gathering such constraints; see function defattach-constraint).
; Therefore any function symbol h in the domain of s0 that occurs in C1 or G1
; is ancestral in some element of the domain of s1, and therefore h is in the
; domain of s1, by the assumption about ancestors.  It follows trivially that
; C1\s1 is a subset of C0\s0 and that G1\s1 is a subset of G0\s0.  -|

; We conclude this essay with some remarks.

; Our first implementation of defattach, in Version_4.0, went through
; considerable contortions to support what had seemed a relatively simple
; attachment for too-many-ifs-post-rewrite (then called
; too-many-ifs-post-rewrite-wrapper).  The problem was that during the first
; pass of the boot-strap, the functions pseudo-termp and pseudo-term-listp were
; in :program mode, yet were needed for the :guard of the encapsulated
; function.  Our solution was to introduce (in Version_4.2) the notion of a
; ``proxy'': a non-executable program-mode function, which can be easily
; introduced using the defproxy macro, and to add keyword argument :skip-checks
; to defattach; see :DOC defproxy.

; There are circumstances where we prohibit attachments to a constrained
; function, by associating a value (:ATTACHMENT-DISALLOWED . msg) with the
; 'attachment property of the function, where msg may be used in error
; messages.  This association enforces some restrictions on receiving
; attachments in the cases of meta functions and clause-processor functions;
; see the Essay on Correctness of Meta Reasoning.  (A different mechanism
; prohibits the functions in *unattachable-primitives* from receiving
; attachments.)

; We discuss a few aspects of how we handle this :ATTACHMENT-DISALLOWED case.
; Source function redefinition-renewal-mode disallows redefinition when there
; is an attachment, but allows redefinition in the :ATTACHMENT-DISALLOWED case.
; Thus, function renew-name/overwrite preserves the 'attachment property in
; order to preserve the prohibition of attachments; and since redefinition is
; disallowed when there is an attachment, this is actually the only case
; encountered in renew-name/overwrite for which there is a non-nil 'attachment
; property.  Finally, note that while the :ATTACHMENT-DISALLOWED case can be
; expected never to hold for a proxy, nevertheless we check this in
; redefinition-renewal-mode before attaching to a proxy.

; Essay on Merging Attachment Records

; See the Essay on Defattach for relevant background.  Our goal in this Essay
; is to describe the process whereby we check for loops in the extended
; ancestor relation and, more generally, compute that relation as a transitive
; closure.

; Let S be the siblings relation: thus S(f1,f2) holds if f1 and f2 are
; introduced in the same event.  Clearly S is an equivalence relation, and we
; will write S(f) to denote the canonical representative of that equivalence
; class, i.e., the canonical sibling of f.  A function f is canonical if S(f)
; is f.

; Recall from the Essay on Defattach that our goal is to reorder events in a
; manner that respects not only the original ancestor relation but also a new
; relation containing the ordered pair <g,f> for each attachment pair <f,g>,
; which we'll call the "immediate extended ancestor relation".  (Motivation:
; The < relation implements the use of an attachment equation in the evaluation
; chronology to define f in terms of g.)  However, for each such <g,f> added to
; that relation, we also add <g',f'> for each sibling g' of g and sibling f' of
; f.  We denote the ordinary ancestors relation as <|, which we also consider
; to respect ancestors: we include <f1',f2'> in this relation whenever f1' and
; f2' are siblings of f1 and f2 (respectively) and f1 is an ordinary ancestor
; of f2.  Finally, we define <+ as the transitive closure of the union of < and
; <|.

; The reordering argument in the Essay on Defattach provides the proof
; obligation that <+ must not contain loops.  Since f1 <+ f2 if and only if
; S(f1) <+ S(f2), we will use canonical siblings in our algorithms.  Indeed, it
; is convenient to think of all of these relations (<, <|, and <+) as being
; defined only on canonical function symbols.  Below, we denote as "f-canonical
; and "g-canonical" the function symbols S(f0) and S(g0), respectively, where
; <f0,g0> ranges over attachment pairs.

; We turn now to describe our transitive closure algorithm for computing <+.
; We create a data structure for each g-canonical function, g.  Each such g is
; associated with its canonical predecessors in each of the relations <| and <,
; and we use notation below such as "FNS" for either of these.  Then, we apply
; a "merge" operation to build up to the transitive closure.  If we encounter a
; loop, as described below, then we stop and report the loop.

; We present our algorithm using examples.  Assume that g1 initially has FNS1
; as its set of predecessors in either <| or <, and that g2 is similarly
; related to FNS2, where g1 < f1 and g2 < f2.  Thus there are attachment pairs
; <f1',g1'> and <f2',g2'> such that S(fi') = fi and S(gi') = gi; and we may
; write FNS1 <+ g1 and FNS2 <+ g2.  Now suppose f2 is in FNS1.  So we have this
; picture:

;                             FNS1 <+ g1
;                FNS2 <+ g2 < f2

; We thus associate with g1 a structure exhibiting the following path, obtained
; by merging the paths above using the attachment pair <f2,g2>.

;                FNS2 <+ g2 < f2 <+ g1

; More generally, we may or may not involve the "f field" (first component) of
; an attachment pair <f,g>.  Consider the following paths P0 and P1.

; P0:                                FNS2 <+ g2 < f2 <+ g1
; P1:   FNS4 <+ g4 <+ ... <+ x <+ g3 < f3

; We could merge using f3 if it is in FNS2, as in our previous example, or
; using g3 if it is in FNS2.  Respectively, the resulting merges of P1 into P0
; are:

;       FNS4 <+ g4 <+ ... <+ x <+ g3 < f3 <+ g2 < f2 <+ g1
;       FNS4 <+ g4 <+ ... <+ x <+ g3      <+ g2 < f2 <+ g1

; Let us call these an "f-merge" and a "g-merge", respectively, of P1 into P0.

; As an optimization, for the case FNS2 <| g2 we only allow a g-merge if P1
; consists entirely of FNS4 <+ g3 < f3.  To justify this optimization, suppose
; that P1 is as above where g4 is not g3.  We may restrict ourselves to
; constructing minimal paths.  We can thus rule out the case x <| g3, since
; otherwise we have y <+ x <| g3 <| g2, which by minimality and transitivity of
; <| implies that we have y < x <| g2.  So x is in FNS2, and we can form a path
; from FNS4 to g1 by doing an f-merge after stripping g3 from P1 (with y<x
; playing the role of g3<f3).

; In general, each such g1 is associated with a record structure that we refer
; to as an "attachment record", which includes a list of paths that is
; continually expanded by merging paths from other records into its existing
; paths.  We return later to a brief discussion of the implementation, in
; particular the relevant data structures.

; We employ a further optimization (function defattach-component-has-owner).
; Stored with each path is an "owner": the function symbol immediately
; following the initial set of functions, which we use to avoid attempting any
; merge that would be redundant in the sense that there is already a path with
; the same owner.  Consider again the merge candidate pictured above.

; P0:                                FNS2 <+ g2 < f2 <+ g1
; P1:   FNS4 <+ g4 <+ ... <+ x <+ g3 < f3

; Suppose we are considering a merge of these components, but the attachment
; record for g1 already has a component owned by g4.  Then we avoid considering
; such a merge, since the result would merely produce another <+-path from FNS4
; to g1.  (Note that we actually store both sorts of FNS4: the <-predecessors
; of g4 and the <|-predecessors of g4.)

; In particular, we never need merge two components from the same record, a
; fact we utilize in function defattach-merge-lst-lst.

; It is easy to see by induction that all paths built by this merging process
; stay inside the transitive closure (<*) of <+.  That is, our algorithm is
; sound.  For completeness, we first need a notion of "suitable" path x0 <+ x1
; <+ ... <+ xk (think of x0 as belonging to the FNS associated with x1),
; defined as follows.

; - We can write the path so that each arc joining consecutive elements is of
;   the form g < f or h <| g, where no two consecutive arcs both use <|.
; - Each element of the path is f-canonical or g-canonical.
; - The final arc in the path is of the form h < g or h <| g for some
;   g-canonical g.

; Clearly the f-merge and g-merge operations shown above preserve this notion
; of suitable path.  It is also clear that every minimal path of length at
; least 2 whose penultimate element is g-canonical is a suitable path.

; Thus, we need consider only suitable paths when forming the transitive
; closure.  We claim that after at least n full iterations of our algorithm
; (that is: attempting all possible pairwise merges at each iteration, and
; perhaps more), then every suitable path FNS <+ ... <+ g of length at most
; 2^N+1 is present.  This fact has a straightforward proof by induction on the
; length of a path, where the inductive step proceeds by dividing a path of
; length 2^N+1 into two pieces where the head of one is the tail of the other,
; one of length at most 2^(N-1) and the other of length at most 2^(N-1)+1.

; The argument above shows that in fact, the attachment record for every
; g-canonical g includes every <+-ancestor of g (again, considering only
; canonical function symbols), either as a member of the set FNS defined by FNS
; <| g' for some g-canonical g' <+ g, or else as such a g' (the owner of the a
; component's path for ordinary ancestor set FNS).

; As we compute the transitive closure, we look for loops.  Where do we look?
; First observe that if there is a loop, then the loop involves at least one
; use of <; so there is a loop connecting g to itself for some g-canonical g.
; By the argument above we know that we will at some point construct a path
; from g; thus g is in FNS where we have constructed FNS <+ h <+ ... g.  When
; that occurs, we report the loop.

; (Remark.  Notice that we are building up the set of extended ancestors of g
; in a manner that lets us report any loop that is found.  We may be able to
; change our algorithm to compute this set more efficiently by unioning all the
; FNS found into a single FNS for the entire attachment record, running the
; original algorithm only if a loop is detected; but that can wait.  The
; current approach may have the advantage that less needs to be thrown away
; when we erase, as with (defattach f nil).  End of remark.)

; Let's explore further how this works at the implementation level.

; Attachment records have the following fields, where we write x++y to denote
; the result of appending y to x unless x or y is a symbol, in which case it is
; treated as a list containing just that symbol.  For example, if x is (f1 f2)
; and y is either (f3) or f3, then x++y is (f1 f2 f3).

; - g
;   where g is g-canonical
; - ext-succ
;   (immediate) canonical successors of g in <
; - components
;   A list of components, each of which is an attachment-component record
;   having the following fields:
;     - path
;       a list of function symbols such that each element has relation < or <|
;       to the next
;     - ext-anc, ord-anc
;       the set of predecessors under < (respectively, <|) of the first element
;       of path++g; thus if path is empty then g else the first element of
;       path.  Note that we collect here only canonical function symbols.
; - pairs
;   list of all attachment pairs <f0,g0> such that S(g0) = g; thus, the
;   :ext-succ field is the set of S(f0) for all <f0,g0> in the :pairs field

; Note that the pairs field is used only by the code that erases attachment
; pairs, not by the code that merges paths.

; The notion of owner, introduced above, is realized in the following
; definition.

(defun attachment-component-owner (g path)

; Return the owner of an attachment-component, with :path field of path, that
; is in the :components field of an attachment record with :g field of g.

  (if path (car path) g))

; The initial attachment record for a given g has a unique component, with
; owner g and empty path, and whose ext-anc field (denoted fns<g) and ord-anc
; field (denoted fns<|g) are, respectively, the set of all immediate extended
; ancestors (i.e., <-predecessors) and of ordinary ancestors (i.e.,
; <|-predecessors) of g.  We maintain the invariant that this component is
; always the last one in the list of components of an attachment record.

; We can now build our algorithm from the bottom up.  The fundamental operation
; is (defattach-merge r1 r2), which merges r2 into r1 if there is such a merge.
; Function defattach-merge-lst takes a record r1 and list lst of records, and
; repeatedly merges the elements of lst into r1.  Function
; defattach-merge-lst-lst is called on a list of records and merges each record
; into each other record in the list.

; But we might find a cycle.  The above functions typically return (mv flg
; result), where: flg = nil if there has been no merging, in which case result
; is irrelevant; flg = 'loop if there has been merging, in which case result is
; the representation of a loop; or flg = t, in which case there has been
; merging but there is no loop.

; below, while omitting unneeded fields.

; R0:
; [:g g0
;  :ext-succ ext-succ0
;  :comps
;  (   ...
;      [:ord-anc ord-anc0
;       :ext-anc ext-anc0
;       :path path0 ; nil or (h0 ...)
;      ...)

; R1:
; (:ext-succ ext-succ1
;  :g g1
;  :comps ; comps1, which is the following list:
;   (
;      ...
;      [:ord-anc ord-anc1
;       :ext-anc ext-anc1
;       :path path1 ; nil
;      ...)

; First consider the f-merge case.  From R0 and R1 we have the following paths,
; where each anci is either ord-anci or ext-anci.

;                       anc0 <+ h0 <+ ... <+ g0
;   anc1 <+ ... <+ g1 < ext-succ1

; For an f-merge we need ext-succ1 and anc0 to intersect; suppose we find h in
; their intersection.  The resulting component then has this path:

;   anc1 <+ ... <+ g1 < h <+ h0 <+ ... <+ g0

; For the g-merge case we require either the use of ext-anc0 for anc0, or else
; that path1 = nil.  Then we can consider the following picture.

;                anc0 <+ h0 <+ ... <+ g0
;   anc1 <+ ... <+ g1

; We can merge if g1 is in anc0, obtaining:

;   anc1 <+ ... <+ g1 <+ h0 <+ ... <+ g0

; Suppose that the merge succeeds.  If g0 is in anc1, then we have a loop.  We
; also have a loop if ext-succ0 intersects anc1, say at h1:

;    h1  <+ ... <+ g1 <+ h0 <+ ... <+ g0 < h1

; If h1 is not itself g-canonical, then will not find the merge below at a later
; step, because it requires merging two components both attached to the same
; record (with :g field g0), which we avoid for efficiency.

;      anc1 <+ ... <+ ... <+ g0
;  g0 < h1

; So we look for these loops, too.

; Since our goal is to produce a <+ path from the owner of the supplied
; component of R1 up to g0, we stop when we find a merge, in which case we
; return (mv nil comp) where comp is the new component for R0.

; For the purpose of finding loops, we can ignore attachments to warrants.  The

; resulting evaluation theory is extended to a bigger evaluation theory in
; which functions are attached to their doppelgangers, and where the warrants
; are all true.  That second step is justified in the paper, ``Limited Second
; Order Functionality in a First Order Setting'', where we prove that for any
; certified user book we could attach defined functions to badge-userfn and
; apply$-userfn so that all the warrants are valid in the resulting evaluation
; theory.

; We can also ignore attachments to warrants when computing extended ancestors
; for handling functions memoized with :aokp t, because the are all attached to
; true-apply$-warrant, which is a defined function and hence cannot have its
; behavior changed with an attachment, and which has no ancestors.  See the
; Essay on Memoization with Attachments.

; This little change can make a big difference.  We ran some tests, in each

; to (tests 1000) except that it first introduced 1000 defun$ events -- hence,
; and more to the point, 1000 defwarrant events.  The time reported for the
; 1000 defattach events went up from 0.15 seconds to more than 4.5 seconds.

; Form is a call of fms, fmt, or fmt1 (or their "!" versions) on variables.  To
; see why we make this restriction, consider the following form:

;   (channel-to-string
;    (f-put-global 'xxx (f-get-global 'term-evisc-tuple state) state)
;    chan)

; If you evaluate this form in raw-mode and then evaluate (@ xxx), you'll
; initially get :default.  But if then evaluate the form

;   (set-term-evisc-tuple (evisc-tuple 4 5 nil nil) state)

; and then evaluate the above channel-to-string call again, this time (@ xxx)
; evaluates to (NIL 4 5 NIL).  Thus, state changed even though
; channel-to-string generates a with-local-state call, which should not change
; state!

; If variable outside-loop-p (which is evaluated) is true, then evaluation of
; this form might be done more efficiently -- but it must be suitable for
; execution outside the loop or, if inside the loop, then without the
; evaluation of state-global-let* (or any other use of the
; *acl2-unwind-protect-stack*) for any state global modified by
; fmt-control-bindings.

; Note that fmt-controls is evaluated, but channel-var and extra-var are not
; evaluated.

; This macro is not recommended for users, as it has been designed specifically
; for the fmt family of functions.  If one wishes to use this or a similar
; macro outside the boot-strap then one will need to avoid issues with
; untouchables; here is an example.

; Essay on Memoization with Attachments (relevant for #+hons version only)

; We maintain the invariant that every stored value in a memo table is valid.

; The main idea is to ensure that if a function m is memoized with :aok t, then
; for every possible call of m, every function called has the same attachment
; now as it did when the value was stored.  To do this, we maintain a stronger
; invariant, described in the next paragraph, that is based on the acyclic
; "extended ancestor" relation introduced in the the Essay on Defattach.
; Roughly speaking, this relation is the transitive closure of the immediate
; ancestor relation, where g is an immediate ancestor of f if either g is an
; ordinary ancestor of f or else <f,g> is an attachment pair (think: f is
; redefined to be g).  We say "roughly speaking" primarily because we traffic
; entirely in "canonical" function symbols, as explained in the Essay on
; Defattach.  Moreover, for our defattach implementation, we include guards in
; the calculation of canonical ancestors.  Guards are relevant in the sense
; that changing or (especially) removing an attachment used in a guard could
; invalidate a stored value, not logically, but in the sense that its
; computation should now cause a guard violation error and thus we don't want
; to return such a value.

; We do something a bit special for apply$-userfn, badge-userfn, and warrants.
; This Essay ignores such special treatment until the end of this Essay.

; Let m be a memoized function symbol.  If m was memoized with :aok nil (the
; default), then the invariant maintained is simply that the
; :ext-anc-attachments field of the memoize-info-ht-entry record for m is nil.
; This implies the property we desire, that all stored entries for m are valid,
; because defattach events do not destroy the validity of stored results.  But
; in the case that f was memoized with :aok t, the :ext-anc-attachments field
; of the memoize-info-ht-entry record for m is a non-null fast alist whose keys
; are exactly the (canonical) extended ancestors of m, including the canonical
; sibling of m.  We maintain the invariant that the value of key f in this fast
; alist is itself an alist associating each sibling f' of f with its
; attachment, for each sibling f' that has an attachment.

; To summarize: in the :aok t case, we maintain the :ext-anc-attachments field
; to have the value described above, and every value stored in the memo table
; is correct with respect to the current attachments, which are those indicated
; in the :ext-anc-attachments field.  Thus, if a defattach event changes the
; attachment of (some sibling of) an extended ancestor, then the
; :ext-anc-attachments field is recalculated and stored anew.  If the only
; changes are to add new attachments, without changing or removing any existing
; attachments, then the memo table is not cleared; otherwise, it is.  The
; analogous actions are taken when we undo.

; For efficiency, we implement extend-world1, retract-world1, and recover-world
; so that they do not update such fields or clear memo-tables until all trips
; have been processed.  (This update is performed by
; update-memo-entries-for-attachments, which is called at the end of the above
; world updates, by update-wrld-structures.)  At that point we see whether any
; defattach event has been installed or undone, and then we see whether any
; memo-table's :ext-anc-attachments field needs to be recalculated, and whether
; furthermore the table needs to be invalidated, as discussed above.  For
; efficiency, we set a global variable, *defattach-fns*, to a list L of
; canonical siblings of all functions whose attachment may have been installed,
; eliminated, or changed.  We then restrict our check on :ext-anc-attachments
; fields (in update-memo-entries-for-attachments) to check attachments for
; siblings of functions in L.  In particular, if L is empty then nothing needs
; to be done.

; The case of warrants is a bit subtle, because we do not store their
; attachments in the world global, 'attachment-records.  (That world global is
; calculated by attachment-records, which has a comment about efficiency
; obtained by omitting warrants.)  That is concerning, since that world global
; is used in the calculation performed by function ext-ancestors-attachments,
; which is called to update memo-tables in update-memo-entry-for-attachments.
; However, we insist (see the check in process-defattach-args1 and the assert$
; in attachment-records) that a warrant may only be attached to
; true-apply$-warrant, which is a fully-defined function (hence cannot receive
; an executable attachment) and has no ancestors.  So we are comfortable with
; omitting true-apply$-warrant from the check for whether any attachment has
; changed in the extended-ancestors of a function.

; Before we consider apply$-userfn and badge-userfn, we say a bit more about
; how the variable *defattach-fns* (discussed above) is extended.  When a
; defattach event is installed, an "attachment object" -- a cons whose car is
; 'attachment -- is added to the world.  When add-trip or undo-trip sees such
; an object produced by defattach, it extends *defattach-fns* with the
; functions for which attachments are given or removed.  The way that undo-trip
; sees these is by a call of maybe-push-undo-stack in add-trip.

; Finally let us turn to how memoization deals with apply$-userfn and
; badge-userfn.  (Also see community book
; books/system/tests/apply-with-memoization.lisp for discussion of an example.)
; These are attached respectively to doppelganger-apply$-userfn and
; doppelganger-badge-userfn, whose behaviors can change (and probably do
; change) every time the badge-table changes.  So consider what happens for a
; call of a function, fn, memoized with :aokp t, when that call invokes
; apply$-userfn or badge-userfn.  The result stored for that call of fn needs
; to be invalidated when the badge is removed from the badge-table for the
; function argument of that subsidiary call of apply$-userfn or badge-userfn.
; We take the conservative approach of considering that the attachment to
; apply$-userfn or badge-userfn has changed; thus, table-cltl-cmd produces a
; special attachment object, *special-cltl-cmd-attachment-mark*, which is (list
; 'attachment *special-cltl-cmd-attachment-mark-name*).  Unlike normal
; attachment objects, add-trip does not extend *defattach-fns* when
; encountering this special one, because there is no need to invalidate
; memoization results when the badge-table is extended.  Add-trip does however
; still call maybe-push-undo-stack, so that undo-trip will push this special
; object onto *defattach-fns*.  Then when it is time for
; update-memo-entries-for-attachments to invalidate memo-tables and recalculate
; :ext-anc-attachments fields, the function ext-anc-attachments-valid-p will
; look for apply$-userfn and badge-userfn among the extended ancestors when it
; encounters the special name, *special-cltl-cmd-attachment-mark-name*,
; handling this case as though the attachments to apply$-userfn and
; badge-userfn have changed.

; Note that we do not concern ourselves with extended-ancestors of
; doppelganger-apply$-userfn or doppelganger-badge-userfn, because these
; functions are untouchable.  Thus, they should never arise except as extended
; ancestors of apply$-userfn and badge-userfn, which we already handle fully as
; discussed above.  That is why we do not mind using nil for the supporters of
; the partial-encapsulate events for doppelganger-badge-userfn and
; doppelganger-apply$-userfn.

; Here is an explanation for why we insist on specific suffices for inlined and
; notinlined functions, following up on remark (2) in :doc defun-inline.

; We insist on a specific suffix for inlined functions, *inline-suffix*,
; because Common Lisp provides no way to undo (declaim (inline foo)).  To see
; why such undoing is relevant, suppose that (defun-inline foo (x) ...) simply
; expanded to:

;   (progn (declaim (inline foo))
;          (defun foo ...))

; Now consider this example:

;   (encapsulate
;     ()
;     (local (defun-inline foo (x) x))
;     ...)
;
;   (defun foo (x) (cons x x))

; When that encapsulate runs, the form (declaim (inline foo)) would be
; generated.  Since there is no way to undo that declaim before starting the
; second pass of the encapsulate, the global (final) definition of foo would
; also be an inline definition, perhaps contrary to intent.  A similar problem
; occurs if (defun-inline foo ...) is in a locally included book.

; (One might ask: why not undo the (declaim (inline foo)) with (declaim
; (notinline foo))?  That also seems unacceptable, because perhaps it would be
; advantageous for the Lisp compiler to inline some definitions of foo and not
; others.  We would really like something like (declaim
; (back-to-no-claims-about-inline foo)), but that's not available.)

; By insisting on a syntactic naming convention for inlined functions --
; namely, their names end in *inline-suffix* (i.e., in "$INLINE") -- we
; avoid this undoing problem.  That is: we don't mind that we can't undo
; the declaim, because every function of that name will be inlined.

; Implementor hint for "(5) Obscure Remark" in :DOC defun-inline: Search for
; ";;; Declaim forms:" in write-expansion-file, and notice the printing just
; below it of a readtime conditional for the host Lisp, so that declaim forms
; are restricted to that Lisp.  This mechanism was probably put into place so
; that declaiming for GCL didn't result in declaiming for Allegro CL, or
; something along those lines.

; Essay on Regenerate-tau-database

; Regenerate-tau-database is motivated by the desire to provide the user with
; some facility for adjusting the tau database to reflect a theory, since
; otherwise there would be no way to achieve that end short of removing certain
; theorems from the script!  We think this will be a rarely-used event simply
; because tau is designed to prove goals, not to simplify or rewrite them.  How
; often will the user wish a goal NOT to be proved?  This is an admittedly
; naive view of the situation, since as of this writing no one has ever used
; the tau system!  It is still being developed.

; Regenerate-tau-database recomputes the database but only considers those
; runes enabled by the current global theory.  But this represents a design
; choice: why not allow the user to specify the theory governing the
; regeneration process?  For example, why not provide:

; (regenerate-tau-database (disable lemma55))

; We call this the ``tau theory alternative'' and rejected it because we think
; it will confuse the user moving forward.  That is, while a particular tau
; theory might be used to regenerate the database when the regeneration event
; is processed, the subsequent incremental extension of the database with
; :tau-system or implicit (auto mode) rules is done under the global theory.
; This could be confusing if the user thinks that the tau theory governs what
; is in the tau database (instead of what was put in it ``initially'' by the
; regeneration event).

; One solution would be to provide a completely separate theory to be used by
; tau.  Setting the tau theory to some new theory would actually recompute the
; tau database.  As new events are added, both the current theory and the tau
; theory are explicitly extended.  All queries to enabled status by the tau
; system, including its use of type-set, would refer to the tau theory.  In a
; situation similar to in-arithmetic-theory we would either have to provide
; versions of enable and disable that are relative to current-tau-theory or
; else warn the user not to use those macros.  All things considered this seems
; like a lot of infrastructure for a rarely used event.

; The design we actually implement doesn't allow for a distinct tau theory.
; The global theory is always used.  If the user wants to regenerate the
; database he or she must reset the global theory appropriately and set it back
; afterwards.  This has the advantage of forcing the user to acknowledge which
; theory is being used.

; In a similar vein, we use the global (acl2-defaults-table) setting of
; tau-auto-modep during the regeneration.

(defmacro set-check-invariant-risk (x &optional table-p)

; In oneify-cltl-code we handle an "invariant-risk" that stobj invariants
; aren't violated upon ill-guarded calls of stobj updaters.  The idea is to
; force evaluation to use *1* functions down to those primitives, which always
; check their guards.  See also the comment in **1*-as-raw*.  Note that this
; is a separate issue from the lack of atomicity of some defabsstobj exports
; (which is implemented using *inside-absstobj-update*).

; There may be cases where this use of *1* functions may be slower than one
; likes.  By setting the invariant-risk mode to nil, one defeats that behavior;
; see :DOC set-check-invariant-risk.  This could be unsound, but since one
; needs an active trust tag to set this global, we take the position that
; setting it is much like redefining prove so that one always gets the "Q.E.D."

; Perhaps we will consider avoiding this use of *1* functions when the only
; danger of invariant violations is from local stobjs.  Since only :program
; mode functions are at issue (because a :logic mode function call only slips
; into raw Lisp when the function has been guard-verified and the call is
; guard-checked, and because raw-ev-fncall binds **1*-as-raw* to nil for
; :logic mode functions), it seems plausible that we can provide this
; optimization for local stobjs.  After all, local stobjs are let-bound rather
; than global; so it seems that during proofs, any local stobj encountered will
; either be created and destroyed during a computed hint or else will be
; modified only by :logic mode functions manipulated by the prover.  (Trusted
; clause processors might provide an exception, but then trust tags are
; involved, so it's their responsibility to do the right thing.)

; But we'll leave that for another day, if at all, as it seems risky and
; error-prone to implement.  In particular, we would likely need to track
; invariant-risk on a per-stobj basis, and built-ins (see
; initialize-invariant-risk) might not be associated with stobjs at all.

; ACL2 functions and macros.  If one uses include-raw and then (comp t), one
; doesn't want to lose those new symbol-functions!  It is thus important, in
; support of (comp t), to extend the values of state globals
; 'program-fns-with-raw-code and 'logic-fns-with-raw-code, with those
; program-mode function symbols whose definitions that have been smashed.  It
; may be less important to extend the value of state global
; 'macros-with-raw-code, but that also seems the right thing to do.

; Thus, this function is essentially (eval form), except that instead of
; returning the value(s) from that evaluation, it retuns a new state where the
; xxx-with-raw-code state globals are extended, according to the definitions of
; ACL2 macros and functions that have changed when form is evaluated.

; We considered making such a modification within the definition of the
; include-raw macro.  However, the do-all-symbols call took well over a half
; second on a small example when it was run interpreted in LispWorks, and that

; Below we introduce doppelganger-badge-userfn and doppelganger-apply$-userfn
; as constrained functions.  See the Essay on the APPLY$ Integration in
; apply-prim.lisp for an overview.  These functions are intended to be the
; doppelgangers of badge-userfn and apply$-userfn, so we introduce them each
; with partial-encapsulate since the explicit constraints do not comprehend all
; properties of the doppelgangers.  Moreover, these doppelgangers change as the
; world changes, so they are each really a class of functions; therefore we
; make them each untouchable, so that users cannot take advantage of their
; changing nature to prove nil.  Also see the Essay on Memoization with
; Attachments.

; The only purpose of this function is to serve as an executable attachment to
