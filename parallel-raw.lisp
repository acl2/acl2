; Section:  Parallelism Basis

; In this section we outline definitions and strategies for parallel evaluation
; and define constants, structures, variables, and other basic parallelism
; infrastructure.

; Essay on Parallelism Definitions

; Core
;
; A core is a unit inside a computer that can do useful work.  It has its own
; instruction pointers and usually accesses shared memory.  In the old days, we
; had "dual processors."  This is an example of a two core system.  A
; 2006-vintage example of a four core system is "dual sockets" with "dual core
; technology."

; Process
;
; We generally use the term "process" as a verb, meaning: run a set of
; instructions.  For example, the system can process a closure.

; Thread
;
; We use the OS definition of a thread as a lightweight process that shares
; memory with other threads in the same process.  A thread in our system is in
; one of the following three states.
;
;   1. Idle - The thread is waiting until both a piece of work (see below) and
;   a core are available.
;
;   2. Active - The thread has been allocated a core and is processing some
;   work.
;
;   3. Pending - This state occurs iff the thread in this state is associated
;   with a parent piece of work, and it is waiting for the children of that
;   piece of work to complete and for sufficient CPU core resources.  A thread
;   in this state is often waiting on a signaling mechanism.

; Closure
;
; We use the term "closure" in the Lisp sense: a function that captures values
; of variables from the lexical environment in which it is formed.  A closure
; thus contains enough information to be applied to a list of arguments.  We
; create closures in the process of saving work to be performed.

; Work
;
; A piece of work contains all the data necessary for a worker thread to
; process one closure, save its result somewhere that a parent can read it, and
; communicate that it is finished.  It also contains some data necessary to
; implement features like the early termination of parallel and/or.  Comments
; at parallelism-piece give implementation details.

; Roughly, work can be in any of four states: unassigned, starting, pending, or
; resumed.  A piece of work will be processed by a single worker thread (not
; including, of course, child work, which will be processed by other worker
; threads).  When a core becomes available, a thread can grab an unassigned
; piece of work, at which time the thread and the piece of work leave their
; initial states together.  From that point forward until the piece of work is
; complete, the piece of work and its associated worker thread are considered
; to be in corresponding states (active/started,resumed or pending).  Initially
; they are in their active/started states.  Later, if child work is created,
; then at that time the thread and its associated piece of work both enter the
; pending state.  When all child work terminates and either a CPU core becomes
; available or a heuristic allows an exception to that requirement, the piece
; of work enters the resumed state and its associated worker thread re-enters
; the active state.  This heuristic (implemented in
; wait-for-resumptive-parallelism-resources) gives priority to such resumptions
; over starting new pieces of work.

; Parallelism Primitive
;
; A macro that enables the user to introduce parallelism into a computation:
; one of plet, pargs, pand, and por.

; End of Essay on Parallelism Definitions

; Essay on Parallelism Strategy

; Whenever a parallelism primitive is used, the following steps occur.  The
; text between the < and > describes the state after the previous step
; finishes.

;  1. If there is a granularity form, the form is evaluated.  If the form
;     returns nil, the parallelism primitive expands to the serial equivalent;
;     otherwise we continue.

; < granularity form has returned true or was omitted - the system was given a
; "large" amount of work >

;  2. If we heuristically determine that the system is already overwhelmed with
;     too much work (see parallelism-resources-available for details), then the
;     primitive expands to its serial equivalent; otherwise we continue.

;  3. Create closures for each primitive's arguments, as follows.
;     - Plet:  one closure for each form assigned to a bound variable
;     - Pargs:  one closure for each argument to the function call
;     - Pand/Por: one closure for each argument

; < have closures in memory representing computation to parallelize >

;  4. Create the data structures for pieces of work that worker threads are to
;     process.  One such data structure (documented in *work-queue* below) is
;     created for each computation to be spawned.  Among the fields of each
;     such structure is a closure that represents that computation.  Siblings
;     have data structures that share some fields, such as a result-array that
;     is to contain the values returned by the sibling computations.
;
;     The system then adds these pieces of work to the global *work-queue* for
;     worker threads to pop off the queue and process.
;
;     Note that Step 2 avoids creating undesirably many pieces of work.
;     (Actually the heuristics used in Step 2 don't provide exact guarantees,
;     since two computations that reach Step 2 simultaneously might both
;     receive the go-ahead even though together, they create work that exceeds
;     the heuristic work limit).

; < now have unassigned work in the work-queue >

; 5.  After the parent thread adds the work to the queue, it will check to see
;     if more worker threads are needed and spawn them if necessary.  Note
;     however that if there are more threads than cores, then any newly spawned
;     thread will wait on a semaphore, and only begins evaluating the work when
;     a core becomes available.  Each core is assigned to at most one thread at
;     any time (but if this decision is revisited, then it should be documented
;     here and in the Parallelism Variables section.  Note that this decision
;     is implemented by setting *idle-core-count* to (1- *core-count*) in
;     reset-parallelism-variables).


;     Note that by limiting the amount of work in the system at Step 2, we
;     avoid creating more threads than the system can handle.

; < now have enough worker threads to process the work >

;  6. The parent thread waits for its children to signal their completion.  It
;     is crucial for efficiency that this waiting be implemented using a
;     signaling mechanism rather than as busy waiting.

; < the parent is waiting for the worker threads to process the work >

; 7.  At this point, the child threads begin processing the work on the queue.
;     As they are allocated resources, they each pull off a piece of work from
;     the work queue and save their results in the associated result-array.
;     After a child thread finishes a piece of work, it will check to see if
;     its siblings' computations are still necessary.  If not, the child will
;     remove these computations from the work queue and interrupt each of its
;     running sibling threads with a primitive that supplies a function for
;     that thread to execute.  This function throws to the tag
;     :result-no-longer-needed, causing the interrupted sibling to abort
;     evaluation of that piece of work, signal the parent (in an
;     unwind-protect's cleanup form on the way out to the catch), catch that
;     tag, and finally reenter the stalled state (where the controlling loop
;     will find it something new to do).  We take care to guarantee that this
;     mechanism works even if a child receives more than one interrupt.  Note
;     that when a child is interrupted in this manner, the value stored for the
;     child is a don't-care.

; < all of the children are done computing, the required results are in the
;   results-array, and the parent has been signaled a number of times equal to
;   the number of children >

; 8.  The parent thread (from steps 1-6) resumes.  It finds the results stored
;     in its results array.  If the primitive is a:
;     - Plet:  it executes the body of the plet with the calculated bindings
;     - Pargs:  it applies the called function to the calculated arguments
;     - Pand, Por:  it applies a functionalized "and" or "or" to the calculated
;                   arguments.  The result is Booleanized.

; documentation in the section "Parallelism Variables."

(defstruct parallelism-piece ; piece of work

; A data item in the work queue has the following contents, and we often call
; each a "piece of work."

; thread-array - the array that holds the threads spawned for that closure's
; particular parent

; result-array - the array that holds the results for that closure's particular
; parent, where each value is either nil (no result yet) or a cons whose cdr is
; the result

; array-index - the index into the above two arrays for this particular closure

; semaphore-to-signal-as-last-act - the semaphore to signal right before the
; spawned thread dies

; closure - the closure to process by spawning a thread

; throw-siblings-when-function - the function to funcall on the current
; thread's result to see if its siblings should be terminated.  The function
; will also remove work from the work-queue and throw the siblings if
; termination should occur.

; Parallelism Variables

(progn

; Keep this progn in sync with reset-parallelism-variables, which resets the
; variables defined here.  Note that none of the variables are initialized
; here, so reset-parallelism-variables must be called before evaluating
; parallelism primitives (an exception is *throwable-worker-thread* since it is
; first called in reset-parallelism-variables).

; *Idle-thread-count* is updated both when a thread is created and right before
; it expires.  It is also updated when a worker thread gets some work to do and
; after it is done with that work.

  (define-atomically-modifiable-counter *idle-thread-count* 0)

; *Idle-core-count* is only used to estimate resource availability.  The number
; itself is always kept accurate using atomic writes.  Since atomic increments
; also stall reads, the value read is no longer only an estimate.  But since we
; don't perform the action associated with a test of the read result while
; holding a lock, it's as if the number read is just an estimate.  It defaults
; to (1- *core-count*), because the current thread is considered active.

; There are two pairs of places that *idle-core-count* is updated.  First,
; whenever a worker thread begins processing work, the count is decremented.
; This decrement is paired with the increment that occurs after a worker thread
; finishes work.  It is also incremented and decremented in
; eval-and-save-result, before and after a parent waits for its children.

; Note: At different stages of development we have contemplated having a
; "*virtual-core-count*", exceeding the number of CPU cores, that bounds the
; number of active threads.  Since our initial tests did not show a performance
; improvement by using this trick, we have not employed a *virtual-core-count*.
; If we later do employ this trick, the documentation in step 5 of the Essay on
; Parallelism Strategy will need to be updated.

  (define-atomically-modifiable-counter *idle-core-count* 0)

; *Unassigned-and-active-work-count* tracks the amount of parallelism work in
; the system, other than pending work.  It is increased when a parallelism
; primitive adds work to the system.  This increase is paired with the final
; decrease in consume-work-on-work-queue-when-there, which occurs when a
; piece of work finishes.  It is decremented and incremented (respectively)
; when a parent waits on children and when it resumes after waiting on
; children.

  (define-atomically-modifiable-counter *unassigned-and-active-work-count* 0)

; *Total-work-count* tracks the total amount of parallelism work.  This
; includes unassigned, started, pending, and resumed work.

  (define-atomically-modifiable-counter *total-work-count* 0)

; We maintain a queue of work to process.  See parallelism-piece for
; documentation on pieces of work.  Even though *work-queue* is a list, we
; think of it as a structure that can be destructively modified -- so beware
; sharing any structure with *work-queue*!

  (defvar *work-queue*)
  (deflock *work-queue-lock*)

; An idle thread waits for the signaling mechanism
; *check-work-and-core-availability* to be signaled, at which time it looks for
; work on the *work-queue* and an idle core to use.  This condition can be
; signaled by the addition of new work or by the availability of a CPU core.

; Warning: In the former case, a parent thread must always signal this
; semaphore *after* it has already added the work to the queue.  Otherwise, a
; child can attempt to acquire work, fail, and then go wait on the signaling
; mechanism again.  Since the parent has already signaled, there is no
; guarantee that the work they place on the queue will ever be processed.  (The
; latter case also requires analogous care.)

; Why are there two distinct signaling mechanisms, one for idle threads and one
; for resuming threads?  Suppose that idle and resuming threads waited on the
; same mechanism.  We would then have no guarantee that resuming threads would
; be signaled before the idle threads (which is necessary to establish the
; priority explained in wait-for-resumptive-parallelism-resources).  Using
; separate signaling mechanisms allows both an idle and resuming thread to be
; signaled.  Then whichever thread's heuristics allow it to execute will claim
; access to the CPU core.  There is no problem if both their heuristics allow
; them to continue.

; We omit the suffix "sem" from the following two variable names, because we do
; not want to think about the counter that resides inside semaphores.  Our
; intent is only to use them as a lockless signaling mechanism.

  (defvar *check-work-and-core-availability*)
  (defvar *check-core-availability-for-resuming*)

; *total-parallelism-piece-historical-count* tracks the total number of pieces
; of parallelism work processed over the lifetime of the ACL2 session.  It is
; reset whenever the parallelism variables are reset.  It is only used for
; informational purposes, and the system does not depend on its accuracy in any
; way.  We therefore perform no locking/synchronization when modifying its
; value.

; This variable has a relatively unsophisticated use: When Rager runs his
; dissertation performance test scripts, sometimes he adjusts the number of
