; Essay on ACL2-doc Data Structures

; Here we briefly summarize some of the main data structures used
; below.

; *acl2-doc-state*: This variable, initialized in acl2-doc-reset, is a
; pair (top-topic-name tuple-list).  Top-topic-name is the name of
; the top topic of the manual.  Tuple-list is a list of tuples,
; created in acl2-doc-alist-create, read from the rendered.lsp file
; but slightly fixed up.  For example, if the manual is the acl2-only
; manual, then (car (car (cdr *acl2-doc-state*))) is:
;   (&ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS (POINTERS) "See [macro-args].")

; (acl2-doc-state-alist): Reset if necessary, then return
; (nth 1 *acl2-doc-state*), which is a list of tuples as described
; above.

; *acl2-doc-history*: a list of pairs (cons point tuple), where tuple
; *is a member of (acl2-doc-state-alist) and point is the position in
; *the topic of that tuple.  This is updated in acl2-doc-display.
