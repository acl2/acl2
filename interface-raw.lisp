;          EVALUATION

; Essay on Evaluation in ACL2

; This essay is structured as follows.  Terminology is explained below.

; A. Introduction
; B. Specification of the problem
; C. Sketch of correctness proof
; D. Why safe mode is necessary
; E. The template for oneification of function definitions
; F. Remarks

; Let us begin.

; A. Introduction

; Evaluation in ACL2, which takes place in the ACL2 loop and during theorem
; proving, is based on the way evaluation was done in Nqthm.  The idea is to
; "oneify" the body of a definition by replacing functions by their so-called
; "executable counterparts," sometimes called "*1* functions."  Also see :doc
; evaluation.  The primitives have *1* functions that reflect their logical
; definitions, so that for example (*1*car x), or more precisely
; (acl2_*1*_lisp::car x), returns nil when x is an atom -- except that an error
; occurs if we are checking guards (or are in so-called safe mode, as explained
; below).  Defined functions have *1* function counterparts that are defined,
; roughly speaking, by replacing each function call in their bodies by a call
; of the corresponding *1* function.

; The evaluation mechanism in ACL2 changed radically in v1-8, when guards were
; removed from the logic.  It has changed again in Version_2.6, due to a hole
; in the existing mechanism, as we explain in Part D of this Essay, below.

; B. Specification of the problem

; Our specification begins with the introduction of three notions of evaluation
; and three notions of macroexpansion.  Evaluation is relative to an (implicit)
; environment, which binds variables to ACL2 values, and operates on ACL2 terms
; that are free of macro calls.  If we want to discuss evaluation of terms that
; involve macro calls, we will compose macroexpansion and evaluation.  This
; composition represents the way that both Common Lisp and the ACL2 loop
; evaluate forms.  We also assume that there is no distinction between
; evaluation of compiled and interpreted code.  Finally, we assume that for all
; of these sorts of evaluation and expansion, macros are expanded before
; function and macro bodies are stored; this is how things are done in the ACL2
; logic and with *1* functions, and it had better be equivalent to how a Common
; Lisp does its evaluation and expansion.

; We extend classes of function symbols to classes of terms in the obvious way:
; a :logic mode term is one whose function symbols are all :logic mode function
; symbols, and similarly for the notion of :common-lisp-compliant.

; Here then are the notions promised above.

;   ACL2 logical evaluation: This procedure is an interpreter that computes
;   using definitions in the logic and obvious properties of primitives (e.g.,
;   (stringp "abc") returns t).

;   ACL2 loop evaluation: This is the procedure used in the ACL2 loop, using
;   so-called *1* functions (and higher-level routines such as raw-ev-fncall).

;   Common Lisp evaluation: As the name implies, this procedure is the one used
;   by Common Lisp.

;   ACL2 logical macroexpansion: This is any procedure that carries out the
;   usual macroexpansion algorithm (outside-in), but entirely using ACL2
;   definitions, including those of :program mode functions.  We assume that
;   macros have already been similarly expanded in function bodies, before
;   evaluation begins.  Macro bodies are evaluated using ACL2 logical
;   evaluation.  This procedure is embodied in the ACL2 definition of the
;   function translate.

;   ACL2 loop macroexpansion: This is the procedure that ACL2 actually applies
;   in order to create terms from user input.  Ideally this procedure returns
;   the same results as does ACL2 logical macroexpansion; the distinction here
;   is between what an appropriate interpreter would return (ACL2 logical
;   macroexpansion) and how ACL2 actually translates a term (ACL2 loop
;   macroexpansion).  ACL2 loop macroexpansion always takes place in safe mode.

;   Common Lisp macroexpansion: This is how Common Lisp (actually, an arbitrary
;   but fixed implementation) macroexpands forms.

; As an aside, we note the following fact that is useful in establishing the
; guarantees below, but whose proof we omit here.

;   (*) If a :common-lisp-compliant function is applied to arguments that
;   satisfy its guard (using Common Lisp evaluation), without error, then the
;   result agrees with that produced by ACL2 logical evaluation.

; Now our top-level guarantees about evaluation and macroexpansion are as
; follows, where for brevity, "evaluation" of a given type is the composition
; of macroexpansion and evaluation for that type.

;   (1) If ACL2 evaluates a :logic mode form without error, then the value
;   returned equals the result of ACL2 logical (macroexpansion and) evaluation
;   of that form.

;   (2) If furthermore that evaluation in done with guard-checking on and the
;   result of ACL2 logical macroexpansion is a :common-lisp-compliant term,
;   then any non-erroneous Common Lisp evaluation returns that same value.

; C. Sketch of correctness proof

; We now outline a proof of these guarantees by breaking them into the
; following sequence of claims.  We write "weakly implements" to mean that two
; procedures give equivalent results on given inputs when they both return
; without error, and we write "implements" if the condition can be weakened to
; assume only that the first procedure returns without error.  That is, proc1
; implements proc2 iff proc1 weakly implements proc2 and whenever proc1 returns
; without error, then so does proc2.  Above, "equivalent" means identical
; except as explained otherwise below.  Implicit in this notion is that the
; input is appropriate for the procedures; for example, our notions of
; evaluation assume that all function symbols in the input are either ACL2
; primitive functions or have been defined as functions (not macros) in ACL2.

; A more rigorous argument would proceed by induction on the length of
; histories, showing that the properties in question hold when one extends the
; history with new function and macro definitions.

;   (1a) ACL2 loop evaluation implements ACL2 logical evaluation on :logic mode
;   terms and, provided safe mode is used, on arbitrary terms.

;   (1b) ACL2 loop macroexpansion implements ACL2 logical macroexpansion.

;   (2a) ACL2 loop evaluation in safe mode weakly implements Common Lisp
;   evaluation.  The same claim holds if the assumption of safe mode is
;   replaced by the assumption that guard-checking is on, provided that the
;   input form expands to a :common-lisp-compliant term.

;   (2b) ACL2 loop macroexpansion weakly implements Common Lisp macroexpansion,
;   where results r1 (from ACL2 loop macroexpansion) and r2 (from Common Lisp
;   macroexpansion) are considered equivalent if for any environment, the ACL2
;   loop evaluation of r1 with guard-checking on returns the same result as the
;   Common Lisp evaluation of r2, provided both evaluations return without
;   error.

; Sketch of proof that guarantees hold.  Clearly (1) follows from (1a) and
; (1b), while (2) follows from (1b) and (2b).  (1a) follows by inspection of
; the template presented below, using (*) above.  (1b) follows from (1a) by
; computational induction on the macroexpansion, because ACL2 loop
; macroexpansion and ACL2 logical macroexpansion differ only in the use of loop
; or logical evaluation of macro bodies.  The first part of (2a) is argued
; similarly to (1a), while the second part is actually quite trivial by
; inspection of the template below.  Finally, (2b) follows from (2a) by a
; computational induction just as (1b) follows from (1a), with a bit of
; complication.  When we encounter a call of a macro first introduced in ACL2
; (either during the boot-strap or by a user), then we evaluate the same macro
; body for ACL2 loop evaluation as for Common Lisp evaluation, except that this
; body has first been macroexpanded using ACL2 loop macroexpansion and Common
; Lisp macroexpansion, respectively.  But these may be viewed as equivalent by
; the inductive hypothesis (where for purposes of this proof we pretend that
; macroexpansion of the body takes place as part of the process).  In the other
; case, the macro already has a Common Lisp definition (as a function or
; macro), and we have arranged that (2) holds.  For example, the ACL2 loop
; macroexpansion of (append x y z) is (binary-append x (binary-append y z)),
; and Common Lisp evaluation of the former clearly agrees with ACL2 loop
; evaluation of the latter.  Q.E.D.

; D. Why safe mode is necessary

; The soundness of ACL2 potentially rests on the principle of not calling raw
; Lisp counterparts of functions with arguments outside their intended domains,
; as specified by their guards.  Here we give three examples illustrating why
; we introduced safe mode in Version_2.6.  The third one is a proof of nil!

; Example 1.  In our first example below, the defun of bar should fail.  It
; does indeed fail starting with Version_2.6, but not in Version_2.5 or (we
; believe) several versions before that.  We discuss below how this can lead
; to unsoundness.

; (defmacro foo (x) (car x))
; (set-guard-checking nil)
; (defun bar (y)
;   (declare (xargs :verify-guards t))
;   (cons (foo y) y))
; :q
; (trace bar)
; (lp)

; Now, the result of evaluating (bar 3) looks as shown below.  Notice that the
; Common Lisp function bar is called.  If the Common Lisp evaluation of the
; form (car 'y) had returned 1 or 2 (say) instead of breaking, then the Common
; Lisp evaluation of (bar 3) would have returned (cons 1 3) or (cons 2 3),
; respectively.  This evaluation could be reflected in theorems (equal (bar 3)
; i) [i=1,2] proved in books certified in two different Common Lisp
; implementations of ACL2.  We could then prove nil by including both books
; into the same session.  Lest one think that one needs different Lisp
; implementations to expose unsoundness, imagine a single Lisp in which (car
; 'y) sometimes returns 1 and sometimes returns 2.

; ACL2 >(bar 3)
;   1> (ACL2_*1*_ACL2::BAR 3)>
;     2> (BAR 3)>
;
; Error: Y is not of type LIST.
; Fast links are on: do (si::use-fast-links nil) for debugging
; Error signalled by CAR.
; Broken at COND.  Type :H for Help.
; ACL2>>

; Here is what ACL2 Version_2.6 prints in an attempt to define function bar,
; above, with guard-checking off.

; ACL2 >(defun bar (y) (foo y))
;
;
; ACL2 Error in ( DEFUN BAR ...):  The guard for the function symbol
; CAR, which is (OR (CONSP X) (EQUAL X NIL)), is violated by the arguments
; in the call (CAR 'Y).  The guard is being checked because this function
; is a primitive and a "safe" mode is being used, perhaps for macroexpansion.
;
;
;
; ACL2 Error in ( DEFUN BAR ...):  In the attempt to macroexpand the
; form (FOO Y), evaluation of the macro body caused an error.

; Example 2.  Unlike the previous example, this one causes problems even when
; guard-checking is on.  (Thanks to Pete Manolios for helping to construct this
; example, which is simpler than an earlier one we had.)

; (defun my-endp-0 ()
;   (declare (xargs :mode :program))
;   (endp 0))
; (defmacro bad-macro ()
;   (my-endp-0))
; :q
; (trace my-endp-0 endp)
; (lp)
; (thm (equal (bad-macro) 1))

; Now look at the following Version_2.5 trace.  It highlights a behavior of
; Version_2.5: when a :program mode function (here, my-endp-0) is
; called on arguments satisfying its guard (here, implicitly t), the
; corresponding raw Lisp function is invoked.  Thus guards are not checked on
; its subroutines (here, endp).  In this example, endp is being called on an
; argument not satisfying its guard.  In the abstract, this is problematic
; because we use guards to restrict primitives to arguments for which the
; result is implementation independent.  If the result of (endp 0) can depend
; on the implementation, we could prove nil as described in the preceding
; example.

; ACL2 !>(thm (equal (bad-macro) 1))
;   1> (ACL2_*1*_ACL2::MY-ENDP-0)>
;     2> (MY-ENDP-0)>
;       3> (ENDP 0)>
;
; Error: 0 is not of type LIST.

; Broken at COND.  Type :H for Help.
; ACL2>>

; The example above may seem contrived (because it is!).  However, our foray
; into this territory began on a rather similar but real example.  In Allegro
; 6.0, the character (code-char (+ 128 65)) is upper case; in particular it is
; not equal to the result of applying char-downcase to it.  However, this is
; not the case for Allegro 5.0.1.  Since the result is
; implementation-dependent, it is natural to restrict the application of
; code-char to standard characters, using ACL2's guard mechanism.  But the
; example above show that we can bypass such restrictions by using macros.

; Example 3.  We can prove nil in Version_2.5 by certifying the following two
; books. The only cheats are that the first book needs to be certified after
; executing the following in the ACL2 loop:

; (set-guard-checking nil)

; First book, call it "ex":

;   (in-package "ACL2")
;
;   (defun my-eq (x y)
;     (declare (xargs :guard t ; "bad" guard
;                     :mode :program))
;     (eq x y))
;
;   (defmacro bad-macro ()
;     (my-eq '(a b) '(a b)))
;
;   (set-verify-guards-eagerness 0)
;
;   (local (verify-termination my-eq))
;
;   (defun bad-fn ()
;     (bad-macro))
;
;   (defthm bad-thm
;     (bad-fn)
;     :rule-classes nil)

; Second book, which includes the one above::

;   (in-package "ACL2")
;
;   (local (include-book "ex"))
;
;   (defthm very-bad
;     nil
;     :hints (("Goal" :use bad-thm))
;     :rule-classes nil)

; In Version_2.6 we get an error when we try to certify the first book above
; ("ex"):

;   ACL2 Error in ( DEFUN BAD-FN ...):  The guard for the function symbol
;   EQ, which is (IF (SYMBOLP X) T (SYMBOLP Y)), is violated by the arguments
;   in the call (EQ '(A B) '(A B)).  The guard is being checked because
;   this function is a primitive and a "safe" mode is being used, perhaps
;   for macroexpansion.
;
;
;
;   ACL2 Error in ( DEFUN BAD-FN ...):  In the attempt to macroexpand the
;   form (BAD-MACRO), evaluation of the macro body caused an error.

; As the first message just above suggests, in Version_2.6 we prevent the bad
; behavior illustrated by the examples above by introducing a "safe mode" for
; use during macroexpansion, in which guards are checked on built-in functions.

; Finally, note that we do not attempt to fix the following "problem."  That
; is, the behavior for the example below is unchanged from Version_2.5 to
; Version_2.6.  The point is that for macroexpansion to behave properly, we
; really need only guarantee consistency between the logic and Common Lisp; it
; is acceptable if in some modes we get errors even when errors are not
; necessary.

; (defun mac-fn (x) (declare (xargs :guard (consp x))) x)
; (defmacro mac (x) (mac-fn x))
; (defun bar (x) (mac x)) ; fails
; :set-guard-checking nil
; (defun bar (x) (mac x)) ; succeeds

; E. The template for oneification of function definitions

; Before we present this template, we give a bit of history and show an
; example.

; The following example shows how *1* functions are handled in Version_2.5 and
; before. The ACL2 definition is:

; (defun foo (x)
;   (declare (xargs :mode :logic :guard (true-listp x)))
;   (if (endp x) 3 (+ 1 (foo (cdr x)))))

; Here is the executable-counterpart in Version_2.5, in gcl:

; ACL2>(symbol-function 'ACL2_*1*_ACL2::FOO) ; in gcl, ACL2 Version_2.5
; (LISP:LAMBDA-BLOCK ACL2_*1*_ACL2::FOO (X)
;   (LABELS ((ACL2_*1*_ACL2::FOO (X)
;                (IF (ACL2_*1*_LISP::ENDP X) '3
;                    (ACL2_*1*_ACL2::BINARY-+ '1
;                        (ACL2_*1*_ACL2::FOO (ACL2_*1*_LISP::CDR X))))))
;     (LET ((ACL2_*1*_ACL2::FOO (SYMBOL-CLASS 'FOO (W *THE-LIVE-STATE*)))
;           (GUARD-CHECKING-ON
;               (F-GET-GLOBAL 'GUARD-CHECKING-ON *THE-LIVE-STATE*)))
;       (COND
;         ((LET ((*HARD-ERROR-RETURNS-NILP*
;                    (OR *HARD-ERROR-RETURNS-NILP*
;                        (NOT GUARD-CHECKING-ON))))
;            (IF (EQ ACL2_*1*_ACL2::FOO :IDEAL)
;                (ACL2_*1*_ACL2::TRUE-LISTP X) (TRUE-LISTP X)))
;          (IF (EQ ACL2_*1*_ACL2::FOO :IDEAL) (ACL2_*1*_ACL2::FOO X)
;              (FOO X)))
;         (GUARD-CHECKING-ON
;             (THROW-RAW-EV-FNCALL
;                 (LIST 'EV-FNCALL-GUARD-ER 'FOO (LIST X) '(TRUE-LISTP X)
;                       '(NIL))))
;         (T (ACL2_*1*_ACL2::FOO X))))))

; Notice the inefficiency of needlessly checking guards in Version_2.5 in the
; :ideal case when guard-checking is off.  We fix that problem in Version_2.6,
; but more importantly, we implement a "safe mode" to be used during
; macroexpansion, so that we can trust that ACL2 and Common Lisp agree when
; they are supposed to, thus avoiding the sort of problem illustrated above
; (function bar and macro mac).  We make this idea precise in our discussion of
; "Guarantees", above.

; ACL2>(symbol-function 'ACL2_*1*_ACL2::FOO) ; in gcl, ACL2 Version_2.6
; (LISP:LAMBDA-BLOCK ACL2_*1*_ACL2::FOO (X)
;   (LABELS ((ACL2_*1*_ACL2::FOO (X)
;                (IF (ACL2_*1*_LISP::ENDP X) '3
;                    (ACL2_*1*_ACL2::BINARY-+ '1
;                        (ACL2_*1*_ACL2::FOO (ACL2_*1*_LISP::CDR X))))))
;     (COND
;       ((TRUE-LISTP X) (RETURN-FROM ACL2_*1*_ACL2::FOO (FOO X)))
;       ((F-GET-GLOBAL 'GUARD-CHECKING-ON *THE-LIVE-STATE*)
;        (RETURN-FROM ACL2_*1*_ACL2::FOO
;          (THROW-RAW-EV-FNCALL
;              (LIST 'EV-FNCALL-GUARD-ER 'FOO (LIST X) '(TRUE-LISTP X)
;                    '(NIL))))))
;     (ACL2_*1*_ACL2::FOO X)))

; Next, we present a basic template (outline, really) for defining executable
; counterparts.  Note that as in the code for Version_2.5, we may optimize away
; consideration of the guard when the guard is t (either implicitly or
; explicitly).  Furthermore, we do some optimization when the symbol-class of
; the function is :common-lisp-compliant, as we do in Version_2.5 for :program
; vs. :logic mode.

; The template below uses some abbreviations <...>, which are defined below the
; template.  See also oneify-cltl-code for more details, special cases, and
; optimizations.  There we also handle the guarded-primitive-p case, which
; pertains to built-in defined functions that need to be responsible for
; checking their guards in safe-mode.  That does not however deal with true

; F. Remarks

; Remark 1.  Notice that safe mode does not by itself force guard-checking in
; all cases, nor does soundness of safe mode require guard-checking as long as
; we do check guards when evaluating calls of functions that are built into
; Common Lisp.  We ensure this in the macro gv, which is changed in Version_2.6
; to cause an error when in safe mode.

; Remark 2.  Consider, in the body of *1*fn, the case that <guard-checking-on>
; holds.  If we were to replace it with (or guard-checking-on program) then we
; would always check guards when in program mode, which would give backward
; compatibility: this scheme would behave exactly as the scheme from
; Version_2.5 for and before did when the new scheme is used in other than safe
; mode.  But we have decided that starting with Version_2.6, we will no longer
; check guards for :program mode functions when 'guard-checking-on has value
; nil (though starting with Version_3.0 you can get this effect when
; 'guard-checking-on has value :none).  After all, even with guard-checking on
; in Version_2.5 you can get nasty Lisp breaks, since we slip directly into
; Common Lisp when a guard holds even though guards cannot be verified for
; :program mode functions.

; Here are the *1* functions.  They should be kept in sync with
; *primitive-formals-and-guards*.  We could probably get by with avoiding
; defining those in the list *oneify-primitives*, for example since want to
; avoid calling "slow" functions, e.g., *1*cons instead of cons.  But we prefer
; to follow the simple rule that every function has a *1* counterpart, which is
; easy to remember.  Moreover, in the case of IF we really do want to define
; *1*if to cause an error, because we insist that the oneification of if remain
; lazy.

; WARNING: Any hand-coded *1* definitions for other than the primitives, such
; as the one for mv-list (see below), must be handled in add-trip and
; compile-uncompiled-*1*-defuns (see the handling there of mv-list).

; but other calls should use raw Lisp functions; see the final case in oneify.
; Here, though, we want to call the *1* function even if it does not have
; invariant-risk, because of the ec-call wrapper.

; We need to be careful in this case that ec-call really does invoke a *1*
; function here, and does so properly.  Consider the following example.

;   (defun f-log () (mbe :logic 'logic :exec 'exec))
;   (defstobj st (fld :type integer :initially 0))

;     (let ((st (update-fld 3 st)))
;       (mv (ec-call (f-log)) st)))
;   (f-prog2 st) ; should return (MV LOGIC <updated-state>)

; If we use the oneify call above (from the case that (not (eq program-p
; 'invariant-risk))), then EXEC would returned as a first value by the call of
; f-prog2 just above, which is incorrect.  The EXEC return value would be OK if
; f-prog2 were defined with the ec-call wrapper removed, because f-log has no
; invariant-risk and hence we want it to execute fast using the :exec form from
; its mbe.  But the ec-call means that we really want to call *1*f-log -- we
; are no longer slipping into raw Lisp and hence we no longer want the special
; **1*-as-raw* handling, which is inappropriate here since it is intended to
; give the illusion that we are in raw Lisp.  Thus, we call *1*f-log and what's
; more, we bind **1*-as-raw* to nil, to signify that we intend to execute the
; function call in the logic.

; See the discussion in (defun-*1* return-last ...).  Here, we discuss only the

; mode but not guard-verified) inside calls of :program mode functions, and
; expect efficient behavior.  The following example illustrates that situation.
; When evaluating (pgm st), we would like the :exec form to be executed.  Note
; that this is exactly what happens if the evaluation is in raw Lisp; here in
; oneify, we arrange for that to happen for *1* evaluation as well.

;   (defstobj st (fld :type integer :initially 0))

;                     :stobjs st))
;     (lgc st))
;
;   (pgm st) ; no "@@@" in output

; Note that we do not give similar treatment to our evaluator (in particular,
; in ev-rec-return-last), since at the top level, we are not inside a function
; body (so there is no issue of :program or :ideal mode).  If however ev-w or
; the like is called in a function body, it will behave as though at the top

; Essay on Stobj Guard Attachments

; We disallow attachments during evaluation of guards on behalf of any stobj
; updater.  The example below, which is a slight modification of one provided
; by Jared Davis, shows why this is important for defstobj.  The idea is that
; in order to preserve the invariant that the stobj recognizer holds, it
; suffices that the initial stobj satisfies that recognizer and that the guard
; holds for each call of an updater.  But suppose for example that an
; attachment is used in evaluating the guard for the first update.  If later
; (perhaps after many more updates) we change that attachment, then that guard
; now may be false, and thus the recognizer may fail to hold after the first
; update and thus fail to hold currently.  On the other hand, if such guard
; evaluation never involves attachments, then since the initial stobj provably
; satisfies the recognizer, then since each updater guard holds (in fact,
; provably holds), the resulting stobjs all satisfy the recognizer.

; The discussion above applies not only in the case of defstobj but also in the
; case of defabsstobj.  Consider an abstract function exported from a
; defabsstobj event that updates a stobj.  The avoidance of attachments
; guarantees that every abstract stobj update satisfies the abstract function's
; guard and hence, by the {preserved} theorems, results in an abstract stobj
; that satisfies the abstract predicate -- provably, since we are dealing with
; ground terms.  Moreover, because of the {guard-thm} theorems we know that the
; concrete predicate provably holds as well, and hence won't be "revoked" as in
; the preceding paragraph.

; Why do we care about guards on concrete stobjs?  For all we know, failure to
; respect those guards could result in corruption of the Lisp process.  An
; obvious case would be if a stobj field is an array of bits, laid out
; compactly according to that spec, and we update with an arbitrary object
; (say, a cons).  Although it seems that only a SATISFIES type declaration
; could result in a attachments being used for guard evaluation, we are
; conservative here.  After all, adding a binding of *aokp* is cheap in the
; context of evaluating just the guard.

; Note that it is not sufficient to ensure for an abstract stobj that the
; corresponding concrete stobj always satisfies its recognizer.  It is easy to
; imagine a defabsstobj :export field that specifies the identify function for
; its :logic component, returning the stobj unchanged, but for the :exec
; component makes an ill-guarded call to update the stobj, corrupting the Lisp
; imagine, before restoring the stobj.  In raw Lisp, this could really happen
; because the export is a macro that calls the :exec function directly; the
; only guard that need be met before this happens is a variant of the :logic
; function's guard, at the level of *1* function of the export.

; Finally, here is the example promised above.

; (progn
;   (defstub foop (x) t)
;   (defun barp (x)
;     (declare (xargs :guard t))

; The code just below ensures that the updater will be evaluated without
; attachments.  It might needlessly ensure that other functions introduced by
; defstobj (for the given stobj-flag) are evaluated without attachments, for
; example if the getprop below returns nil because the necessary property has
; not yet been put into wrld.  But as of this writing, the test seems to apply

; with unpleasant guard violations.  For example, wet (when we had it) expanded
; to a call of with-error-trace-fn, and if the idea of :all is applied then we

; functions): with-error-trace-fn, trans-eval, ev, ev-rec, ev-fncall-rec,
; ev-fncall-rec-logical, w-of-any-state, and finally global-table.  The last of
; these calls causes a guard violation since *the-live-state* is not a true
; list.

; Also, we want to make sure that built-in :program mode functions run fast,
; for example, defthm-fn.

; EXTENDING AND RETRACTING PROPERTY LIST WORLDS

; We here sketch the entire world management scheme before diving into
; the details.  The software archaeologist might think these summaries
; were written just for his use but that is wrong.  In fact, these are
; design sketches and refresher courses to bring to mind the salient
; details before getting back down to work.  This particular one
; represents the attempt to get back into this frame of mind after
; several days of Christmas preparations, 1990.  (Note: This essay has
; been updated since, to track changes such as the adoption, in April,
; 1994, of the restriction that reincarnated undone defpkgs must
; import only a subset of the old imports.  That attack on the
; "unintern problem" was sketched as the "Alternative Design Proposal"
; in the December, 1990 essay but rejected as unnecessary as it was
; then thought that we handled reincarnation correctly by uninterning
; all symbols except in abort recovery.  But :oops and the second pass
; of include books, etc., exposed the lie.)

; A property list "world" is a list of triples as created by putprop.
; Each triple is of the form (symb key . val).  Such a list is
; accessed by getprop, which, logically speaking, scans down it
; looking for a given symb and key.  Practically however, we allow a
; given world to be "installed" under any given symbolic name.  What
; installation does is assemble into an alist all of the properties of
; each symb in the world and put that alist on the property list of
; the symbol, under some special key that is associated with the name
; of the installed world.

; If name has an 'acl2-world-pair property then name is the name of an
; installed world.  The value of the property will be a pair, (alist .
; world-key), where alist is the (eq) world alist installed and
; world-key is a unique symbol associated with this world name and
; under which each symb's property alist is stored.

; The functions extend-world and retract-world will extend and retract
; a named world.  Logically speaking, these two functions are identity
; functions.  But practically speaking they smash Common Lisp property
; lists.  Extend-world must be given a name and a world that is an
; extension (eq) of the one currently installed under the name and
; will install the new properties.  An analogous remark holds for
; retract-world.  We make these functions available to the ACL2
; programmer.

; We store our own property list world under the name 'current-acl2-
; world.  How do we prevent the ACL2 programmer from smashing our
; properties?  Well, extend-world (which is logically a no-op all the
; time) is even a no-op practically on the name 'current-acl2-world.
; To smash property lists you must call extend-world1 (not an ACL2
; function) and that function works on any name.  Our ACL2 function
; set-w, which installs the current-acl2-world, calls extend-world1 in
; its #-acl2-loop-only code.  Set-w is, of course, untouchable.

; We include special support for retraction, which of course is the
; basis of undoing.  It would suffice, for extension and for getprop,
; if we could expedite the retrieval of the most recently put value of
; every symbol and key.  Suppose the world in question is w, named
; name, and suppose it is installed under the property name world-key.
; Suppose the only three triples on w about symb are (symb key1 . b),
; (symb key1 . a), and (symb key2 . c), occurring in that order on w.
; Then for purposes of extension and getprop alone, we could store
; '((key1 . b) (key2 . c)) under symb's world-key property.  But now
; suppose we wanted to retract back to where (symb key1 . a) was most
; recent.  Then we would need to change the alist stored under symb's
; world-key to '((key1 . a) (key2 . c)) and to find the newly exposed
; value for key1 we would have to search w.  This is what we did for
; the first 18 months of ACL2's development.  This made :ubt suffer
; because when we undid a property -- especially a property on some
; symbol like binary-+ or cons -- we would have to scan all the back
; down the world to the primordial putprops to recover the newly
; exposed values.  This was bad not so much because of the scan time
; but because of the swap time: the world is big and rarely
; referenced, so it tends to get paged out and then when you scan it
; you have to page it back in.  This can take a minute or more.

; To avoid this we actually store a stack for each key.  The stack is
; the list of all past values of the key, topped by the current value.
; An empty stack indicates that no putprop has occurred for that key
; (or, more accurately, that we have retracted back past the first
; putprop for that key).

; There is another twist to this scheme.  To support the execution and
; compilation of ACL2 functions in raw Common Lisp, we interpret a
; certain putprop symb key, namely CLTL-COMMAND GLOBAL-VALUE, as a
; directive to smash the symbol-function, macro-function, or constant
; definition of certain symbols contained in the value.  We only do
; this if we are installing 'current-acl2-world, of course.  To
; support undoing of these smashes we maintain a stack of the past
; settings of those fields.  This is the *undo-stack* of the symb.
; The situation here is complicated and more fully explained in the
; code below.

; The installation of worlds and error recovery are intimately con-
; nected to the problem of uninterning symbols on behalf of undone or
; reincarnated packages.  When the CLTL-COMMAND defpkg is encountered,
; the program defpkg is called to create the package.  Consider what
; would happen if defpkg were coded so as to unintern the symbols in
; the existing package and set the import list as per the new defini-
; tion (as, indeed, we once did, allowing the reincarnation of undone
; packages).  In particular, consider the effect this would have on
; triples yet-to-be installed: if they mentioned symbols in the new
; package then those symbols would suddenly become uninterned.  We
; once thought this was ok because symbols in newly defined packages
; couldn't yet exist in the yet-to-be installed world.  But that is a
; bogus claim: if we are reinstalling a world after an error abort or
; even an :oops the world might contain symbols in the "just defined"
; package.  This is what eventually drove us to implement the restric-
; tion described in :DOC package-reincarnation-import-restrictions.

; Because of the possibility of user interrupts, it is possible that we
; can have effected some but not all of changes necessary to achieve a
; new state and then have the computation aborted.  To handle this,
; extend-world1 and retract-world1 both save the current world alist
; before they begin to make any changes.  If they are interrupted, the
; original configuration can be recovered by retracting back to nil
; and then extending to the saved current world.  This is admittedly
; inefficient -- all 20,000 properties of a typical current-acl2-world
; might have to be stored again because we didn't bother to remember
; how much of the extension we had done when we were interrupted.  On
; the other hand, it is truly simple and elegant and only comes into
; play with aborts during installation.

; Inspection of the lisp code for defpkg will reveal that it is
; sensitive to abort recovery in one other aspect.  If we are in abort
; recovery and the "dual package" (the one used to house the lisp
; equivalents of state global variables) already exists, we do not
; unbind all the variables in it but simply leave it untouched.  Since
; neither extending nor retracting changes state globals, the state
; global settings at the time of an abort are what they were when *w0*
; was saved.  Hence, by doing nothing to the dual package we keep the
; installed world and the state globals in the same relationship.

; So much for the sketch of the world management business.  We now get
; down to brass tacks.

; See add-trip below for context.  Fn is one of the raw Lisp function names
; secretly spawned by CLTL-COMMAND forms, e.g., DEFUN, DEFMACRO, DEFCONST,
; DEFPKG, DEFATTACH, or (for the HONS version) MEMOIZE or UNMEMOIZE.  Name is
; generally the symbol or string that is being defined.

; Whenever we smash a CLTL cell we first save its current contents to permit
; redefinition and undoing.  Toward this end we maintain a stack for each
; defined symbol, called the *undo-stack* property of the symbol.  Very roughly
; speaking, the stack contains the previous values of the cells in question.
; Add-trip will push the old value onto the stack before storing the new and
; undo-trip will pop the stack and restore that old value.  Ah, were it only
; that simple...

; There are complications.  First, DEFPKG doesn't have a symbol associated with
; it explicitly, so we have to manufacture one for the *undo-stack*.  We use
; the ``base symbol'' of the package (see chk-acceptable-defpkg).  If the
; symbol-package-name string is "name" then the base symbol is the symbol
; ACL2::name-PACKAGE.  (We use that symbol as a rule name associated with the
; defpkg axiom and so we already check that the name is new.)  Second, DEFPKG
; makes the notion of "current contents" highly abstract because it not only
; creates a package but imports various symbols into it.  So rather than use
; the *undo-stack* to save the "current contents" we use the stack to save a
; form that when evaluated will recreate the "current contents" of the cell in
; question.  When a new value is stored (and the cell is already in use) we
; will manufacture a suitable form for recreating the old value and push it.

; Third, extra (formerly called ignorep because of its connection to the
; ignorep variable in add-trip) is either nil, 'reclassifying or '(defstobj
; . stobj).  When it is 'reclassifying, we only save the *1* def for name.
; Otherwise, we save both defs.

; Now we define the two programs that manage the stacks of old
; property values.

; We start with pushing a new value onto the stack for a given key.
; Complicating things is our decision to order the keys in the alists by (a
; priori) frequency of access.  The aim is to speed up getprop.  We record
; the results of many experiments below.

; Recall that the current-acl2-world is implemented so that the logical
; properties are stored in an alist which is obtained via a raw lisp get of the
; property *current-acl2-world-key*.  That alist is then searched with assoc
; :test #'eq.  Of interest then are both the order of the properties
; encountered by the raw lisp get and the order of the keys encountered by the
; assoc :test #'eq.

; The basic experiment addressed one particular proof in the Nqthm package.  To
; set the stage, the Nqthm package was loaded and then undone back through
; NQTHM-COUNT-SYMBOL-IS-COUNT-FN-UNPACK, a theorem whose reported proof time is
; 35.23 by the current Version 1.8.  Then that theorem was proved again while a
; patch was in place inside of fgetprop.  The patch collected together an alist
; recording the calls of fgetprop.  In particular the alist entries were of the
; form (symb (key1 . cnt1) ... (keyk . cntk)) indicating that (fgetprop symb
; keyi <some-default> <current-acl2-world>) was called cnti times during the
; proof.  We then wrote and compiled a program that swept the alist and
; repeated every call of fgetprop simply to allow us to measure the total time
; spent in fgetprop.  There were a total of 102781 calls.  To sweep the alist
; with a no-op function of the same arity as fgetprop required 0.25 seconds.
; We therefore consider that to be the overhead of the sweep itself.  To sweep
; with fgetprop required 0.75 seconds, indicating that a "net" 0.50 seconds
; were actually spent in fgetprop on the actual calls in the sample theorem.
; (We will use "net" henceforth to mean the measured time minus 0.25.)  This
; gives an expected "per call" time of 4.86E-6.

; For what it is worth, a noop that calls get has an overhead of 0.267 for
; a net of 0.017 or a per call time of 1.65E-7 seconds.  Thus an fgetprop
; is about 30 times slower than a get (with the orderings created by the
; current Version 1.8).

; However, we have noticed that *current-acl2-world-key* is not always the
; first property encountered by the raw lisp get.  Other properties sometimes
; covering it up include *UNDO-STACK*, *PREDEFINED* and SYSTEM:PNAME.  We
; therefore moved *current-acl2-world-key* to the front of every symbol-plist.
; The net sweep time was then 0.30 (for a per call time of 18 gets).

; We now move on to ordering the keys seen by assoc :test #'eq.  In prior
; experiments we had determined the frequency with which the various keys are
; accessed (during the entire Nqthm package proof).  For what it is worth, here
; is the key list, in order from most frequently accessed to least:

;   '(COARSENINGS GLOBAL-VALUE CONGRUENCES SYMBOL-CLASS TYPE-PRESCRIPTIONS
;     LEMMAS RUNIC-MAPPING-PAIRS MULTIPLICITY STATE-IN
;     RECURSIVEP DEF-BODIES CONSTRAINEDP LINEAR-LEMMAS
;     FORMALS MACRO-BODY FORWARD-CHAINING-RULES STATE-OUT TABLE-ALIST
;     GUARD MACRO-ARGS ELIMINATE-DESTRUCTORS-RULE CONST LEVEL-NO
;     UNNORMALIZED-BODY THEOREM REDEFINED INDUCTION-MACHINE JUSTIFICATION
;     INDUCTION-RULES CONTROLLER-ALIST QUICK-BLOCK-INFO

; We therefore reordered the alist so that the keys were stored with the most
; frequently accessed ones first.  We added nil COARSENINGS and CONGRUENCES
; properties (and later, as described below, RECURSIVEP) to those function
; symbol property lists for which the value of the property was nil but the
; property was unrecorded.  (This saves the time of cdring through the entire
; list to compute the most frequently seen two properties.)  Technically, we
; extended and reordered the alist found in (get symb
; *current-acl2-world-key*), for each symbol with a *current-acl2-world- key*
; property and that property was always first on the symbol-plist.

; We then repeated the sweep in a net time of 0.22 seconds (per call = 13 gets).

; We then reversed the "optimal" ordering on the property lists and measured a
; net time of 0.31 (down from 0.30 from the random order of Version 1.8).

; Finally, we perturbed the property lists by adding 10 new property keys and
; values to the front of every (get symb *current-acl2-world-key*) and measured
; a net time of 0.50.

; From this experiment one can make the following conclusions: (a) In this
; theorem, fgetprop is responsible for less than 2% of the proof time.  Making
; fgetprop instantaneous would reduce the 35.23 seconds to 34.73 seconds.

; By ordering the properties (in both senses) we can speed fgetprop up from
; about 30 gets to about 13 gets, more than doubling its speed.

; The rest of this essay on experimental results discusses some detailed
; investigations that led to virtually no further improvement (see stats at the
; end of the essay).  The lesson learned is that it may not be worth mucking
; around further with *current-acl2-world-key-ordering*.

; In July 2002, during the development of Version_2.7, we modified the use of
; the fnstack (specifically, being-openedp) so that for recursive functions we
; look up the representative of a clique, thus avoiding the need to look
; through all members every clique for the function at hand.  (A
; mutual-recursion nest with 4,786 defuns at AMD prompted this change.)  As a
; result we saw a 1.8% slowdown in the regression suite, reduced to 0.9% with
; some optimizations.  Presumably the slowdown was due to the more frequent use
; of the RECURSIVEP property.  So we ran experiments using community books
; files books/certify-numbers.lisp and books/rtl/rel2/support/cert.lsp, though
; we aborted the latter part way through lop3.lisp (during the proof of
; BITN-LAM0, which seemed to be bogging down).  The results using
; analyze-fgetprop-stats were as follows.

; We now develop support for early loading of compiled files, beginning with an
; essay that outlines that development.

; Essay on Hash Table Support for Compilation

; This essay has the following main parts:

; Part 0: High-level summary
; Part 1: A more detailed introduction
; Part 2: Including a certified book
; Part 3: Writing an expansion file for compilation

; Part 0: High-level summary

; We strive for efficiency of include-book.  By doing all compilation at
; certify-book time rather than include-book time, we may greatly speed up
; definitional processing in lisps such as CCL and SBCL, which compile every
; definition on the fly.  We were motivated by profiling results showing that
; such processing can take 45% of include-book time: a test case from Centaur
; using CCL was spending this proportion of time in the installation of a
; Common Lisp symbol-function for each defun event, in add-trip.  The problem
; was that the CCL compiler is called every time a defun is evaluated, and
; although the CCL compiler is impressively fast, it's not instantaneous.  Dave
; Greve has reported observing significant such slowdowns using CCL at Rockwell
; Collins.

; Happily, with this change we found the time cut roughly in half for two
; include-book tests from Centaur provided by Sol Swords.  Other tests suggest
; no noticeable slowdown for certify-book or include-book for GCL or Allegro
; CL, which do not compile on the fly.

; Our approach is to avoid calling the compiler (by CCL or SBCL, at least)
; every time a definition is encountered by include-book, by instead using
; existing code previously compiled by certify-book, which is loaded before
; processing of events by include-book.  Thus, the main efficiency gains from
; this change are expected to be for ACL2 built on CCL or SBCL, as these are
; the Lisps we know of (as of March 2010) that compile all definitions at
; submission time and therefore had been compiling on behalf of add-trip.
; However, this approach may also boost efficiency in some cases even for Lisps
; other than CCL and SBCL.  For one thing, include-book will now install a
; compiled symbol-function for each defun, even for those other Lisps, which
; can speed up computations in ensuing defconst forms and defmacro forms of the
; book.  Moreover, compiled code will be installed for defmacro and defconst
; forms, which can avoid the need for redoing macroexpansion of the bodies of
; such forms during add-trip.

; A simple-minded approach is to load the compiled file for a book *before*
; processing events in the book.  The obvious problem is that ACL2 demands that
; a function not be pre-defined in raw Lisp when evaluating a defun event, and
; for good reason: we want to protect against accidental previous definition in
; raw Lisp.  So instead, our solution is to arrange that loading compiled files
; does not actually install definitions, but rather, builds hash tables that
; associate symbols with their definitions.  The file to be compiled thus has
; roughly the following structure; the prefix "hcomp" is intended to refer to
; "hash-table-supported compilation".

; (in-package "ACL2")
;;; Introduce some packages, without any imports:
; (maybe-introduce-empty-pkg "MY-PKG")
;;; Save some information about the fni:
; (setq *hcomp-fn-alist* '((fn1 ..) (fn2 ..) ..))
;;; Build a hash table associating each fni with its pre-existing
;;; symbol-function or special *unbound* mark:
; (hcomp-init)
;;; Generate declaim forms (depending on the Lisp):
; ...
;;; Portcullis commands and events from the book, with make-events expanded:
; ...
;;; *1* definitions to compile:
; ...

; The load of each book in raw Lisp (by function load-compiled-book) is
; followed by code that saves the symbol-function for each fni in a hash table,
; *hcomp-fn-ht* (function hcomp-transfer-to-hash-tables), which in turn is
; associated with the full-book-name in a global hash table, *hcomp-book-ht*.
; But first, the (hcomp-init) form arranges to save -- in a global hash table,
; *hcomp-fn-macro-restore-ht* -- an association of each fi with its existing
; symbol-function (or a "not bound" marker).  After all such files are loaded
; in raw Lisp under the top-level included book (by a call of include-book-raw
; under include-book-fn), the relevant *hcomp-fn-ht* hash tables will have been
; populated and saved in the global hash table mentioned above,
; *hcomp-book-ht*, keyed on full-book-names.  The top-level include-book will
; finish up after such files are loaded (for that book and subsidiary included
; books), using the global hash table *hcomp-fn-macro-restore-ht* to restore
; the symbol-function of fi (much more typically, to make the symbol-function
; of fi unbound) when the top-level load concludes.

; Above, we say "roughly" because there are numerous complications.  For
; example, *1* functions can be defined twice (once for :program mode and once
; for :logic mode); there may be portcullis commands for subsidiary
; include-book events within the book; and the absence of a missing compiled
; file for a sub-book can cause an abort, so some of the above finishing up
; might need to be done in the cleanup form of an acl2-unwind-protect.  In this
; Essay we outline our mechanism and explain how we deal with such
; complications.

; We are breaking from ACL2 versions up through  3.6.1, by insisting that the
; compiled file for a book is loaded "early" (if it is loaded at all), i.e.,
; before events are processed from that book.  This approach not only can boost
; efficiency of include-book, but it also provides a solution to a soundness
; bug in the redundancy of :program mode definitions with preceding :logic mode
; definitions, present from Version_3.5 through Version_3.6.1.  To illustrate
; this bug, consider the two books below, which have been certified in ACL2
; 3.6.1 built on GCL.  The problem is that inclusion of bk1 inside bk2 smashes
; the symbol-function of *1*foo, because of loading of compiled file bk1.o.
; (The Allegro CL version merely breaks when attempting to prove BUG.)

; -------------------- bk1.lisp --------------------

; (in-package "ACL2")
; (defun foo (x)
;   (declare (xargs :mode :program))
;   (car x))

; -------------------- bk2.lisp --------------------

; (in-package "ACL2")
; (defun foo (x)
;   (car x))
; (defun bar (x)
;   (foo x))
; (defthm fact
;   (null (bar 3))
;   :rule-classes nil)
; (encapsulate
;   ()
;   (local (include-book "bk1"))
;   (defthm bug
;     (not (null (bar 3)))
;     :rule-classes nil))
; (defthm contradiction
;   nil
;   :hints (("Goal" :use (fact bug)
;                   :in-theory (disable (bar) bar)))
;   :rule-classes nil)

; ----------------------------------------

; The bug occurs because the local include-book of "bk1" loads bk1.o, which
; smashes the symbol-function of *1*foo to its :program mode version, which
; unlike the :logic mode version passes evaluation directly to raw Lisp,
; causing evaluation of (car 3).  Of course we don't really need to solve this
; problem for CCL-based ACL2 images that do not load compiled files.  But that
; seems ugly, as one could then certify a book with CCL that cannot be
; certified with another Lisp.

; Another, less serious problem is also solved by early loading of compiled
; files.  Consider the following books.

;;; bar.lisp
; (in-package "ACL2")
; (defun foo (x)
;   (declare (xargs :guard t))
;   (cons x x))

;;; foo.lisp
; (in-package "ACL2")
; (defun foo (x)
;   (cons x x))

;;; top.lisp
; (in-package "ACL2")
; (include-book "bar")
; (include-book "foo")

; The *1* function generated for foo in bar.lisp is considerably simpler than
; in the case of foo.lisp, because there need be no check that the symbol-class
; of foo is :common-lisp-compliant.  When we include top in Version_3.6.1 or
; earlier, loading compiled files, the compiled file for foo overwrites the one
; for bar, leaving us with the more complicated *1* code.  This is clear if one
; uses CLISP and evaluates (disassemble (*1*-symbol 'foo)) in raw Lisp: 13
; byte-code instructions if one includes foo or top, but only 3 byte-code
; instructions if one includes bar instead.  With early loading of compiled
; files, evaluation of (include-book "top") will define this *1* function when
; including bar, but will not define it again when including foo.

; (The above example isn't convincing of much, really, since if we switch the
; order of the include-book forms in top.lisp then we will get the complicated
; *1* compiled definition of foo, because the definition from bar.lisp will be
; redundant.  But it still seems preferable to avoid loading compiled files
; that overwrite definitions needlessly, for example to put less stress on the
; garbage collector.)

; Of course, these issues disappear if the compiled file is not loaded at all,
; and we support that too, using state global 'compiler-enabled.

; We conclude this Part with a few words about handling of the case that
; include-book argument :load-compiled-file has argument :comp.  The basic idea
; is to wait until the book is included, and then check that either the
; compiled file or the expansion file exists and is not older than the
; certificate; and only then, if the expansion file exists but the compiled
; file does not, do we compile the expansion file and then load it in the
; ordinary way (without messing with hash tables, by leaving the relevant
; variables such as *hcomp-fn-ht* bound to nil).  We considered more complex
; approaches but are quite happy with this simple solution, and we don't say
; anything further about the case of :load-compiled-file :comp in this Essay.

; Part 1: A more detailed introduction

; We now give a more detailed global view of our approach based on hash tables.
; Note that since compilation is inherently a raw-Lisp activity, we code
; shamelessly in raw Lisp when that is convenient.

; The idea is for include-book to load an existing compiled file before
; processing events from the book, even before its portcullis commands are
; processed.  The compiled definitions are stored in hash tables for subsequent
; use by add-trip, then immediately undone so that existing definitions are
; restored (or, much more often, symbols are again unbound).  We must however
; be careful to use these hash tables only when appropriate: in particular,
; verify-termination changes *1* definitions, so there can be two definitions
; generated for the same symbol -- and loading the compiled file provides the
; latter definition, which is inappropriate to use for the first defun but is
; appropriate for the defun generated by the verify-termination.

; (Aside: We might consider using the latter symbol-function for both the
; :program and :logic mode *1* functions.  But it's easy to imagine that the
; :logic code asks about the symbol-class of the function symbol under the
; assumption that it's definitely not :program -- and that assumption would be
; violated if we installed that code when the :program mode version is
; introduced.  Whether or not that problem actually exists, or at least is easy
; to fix, this example nevertheless illustrates that evaluation in ACL2 is
; complex and delicate.  So we prefer to be conservative and not to install a
; :logic mode *1* function definition for a :program mode function.)

; The introduction of make-event in 2006 initiated the writing of what we call
; below an "expansion file", to be compiled instead of the source book,
; creating what we call below the "compiled file".  This feature was further
; exploited by incorporating compiled *1* functions into the compiled file
; (Version_3.2.1).  We take further advantage of these expansion files by
; putting forms into them to implement the plan outlined above.  Note that we
; handle certain events that create 'cltl-command properties, as processed by
; add-trip: defun, defstobj, defabsstobj, defconst, and defmacro, but not
; memoize and unmemoize, even in the #+hons case.  Extra forms near the top of
; the expansion file will be evaluated when loading the compiled file, to store
; values in hash tables for later use, when add-trip deals with 'cltl-command
; properties.  Those extra forms are based on information deduced during the
; include-book phase of book certification, at which time Lisp global
; *inside-include-book-fn* has value 'hcomp-build.  Later, during subsequent
; include-books, that information directs which definitions from the expansion
; file are to be stored in our hash tables.  Additional forms are evaluated
; after completion of the load of the compiled file, to transfer the compiled
; definitions to hash tables and eventually to remove each definition installed
; by the expansion file (restoring any pre-existing definitions).  This
; eventual removal occurs only after a load completes for the top-level
; compiled file of a book, and hence also for all books included therein.

; Portcullis commands and included sub-books present challenges.  Consider for
; example a constant whose value is a symbol in a package defined in a
; sub-book's portcullis commands.  If we load the compiled file for the book
; that defines that constant, but treat the include-book of the sub-book as a
; no-op (as was done through Version_3.6.1), then it doesn't seem clear that
; this constant's value would be interned in any package, since its package is
; defined in the portcullis commands of the not-yet-loaded sub-book.  Indeed,
; we need to consider loading not only the sub-book but also its portcullis
; commands.  At the very least, we want to avoid warnings that could occur when
; encountering a global or function call in the parent book (say, during macro
; expansion) when the definition of that global or function (by defconst or
; defun, respectively) comes from the unloaded sub-book.  And certainly we do
; need a sub-book's portcullis commands when loading it, for example in case
; one of those commands defines a function that is used in a defconst form in
; the book.

; We thus write portcullis commands into the expansion file.  But with some
; reflection one discovers that a book's initial in-package form itself could
; be problematic, since if the package in question is not the "ACL2" package
; then it needs to be defined in some book's portcullis commands!  So we always
; start an expansion file with (in-package "ACL2"), and when we write the forms
; into the expansion file, we always do so relative to the ACL2 package.

; But our problems with packages don't end there!  The setq forms defining
; *hcomp-fn-alist* and the like may involve symbols defined in packages
; introduced in the portcullis commands.  (Why use setq instead of
; defparameter?  Variables such as *hcomp-fn-alist* are already declared
; special using defvar in the ACL2 sources, so setq is certainly legal.  We
; found a case with CCL in which the use of defparameter slowed down
; include-book by a factor of more than 100.)  But we want to lay these down
; before a call of hcomp-init, which will consult *hcomp-fn-alist* and such
; when storing information to let us undo definitions installed by loading the
; compiled file.  This call of hcomp-init, and its preceding definitions of
; *hcomp-fn-alist* and the like, must therefore be laid down before the very
; portcullis commands that may define packages of symbols used in these
; definitions.  Our solution is to use defpackage to introduce packages before
; the symbols are read, and to make a note using special variable
; *defpkg-virgins* that such packages are legitimate targets for the defpkg
; forms to come.

; (Aside: Why does it work to start the expansion file with the introduction of
; an empty package, say "MY-PKG", and then lay down forms like the
; *hcomp-fn-alist* form, above, that may refer to symbols written out at the
; end of book certification?  The only symbols where one might imagine this is
; an issue are ones that are printed differently when "MY-PKG" is fully defined
; (near the end of certification) than when it is introduced with no imports by
; an initial form that introduces the package as "empty" (no imports).  The
; only such symbols are those written without a package prefix, hence included
; in the "ACL2" package, that are in the import list for "MY-PKG".  But such
; symbols aren't a problem after all, because any reference to such a symbol in
; the "ACL2" package is really a reference to a symbol of that name in the
; "MY-PKG" package, once that package is "truly" introduced by defpkg.  And
; until such a defpkg form is evaluated, ACL2 will not dabble in symbols in the
; "MY-PKG" package, other than to save them in *hcomp-fn-alist* and related
; lists near the top of the expansion file.)

; Note that in a break from ACL2 versions up through  3.6.1, where ACL2 could
; load compiled files for uncertified books, the write-date comparison of the
; compiled file (or expansion file) is against the certificate rather than the
; source .lisp file.  (Well, that's not quite true: the comparison remains
; against the source book when include-book is executed in raw mode, since raw
; mode does not involve the certificate file.)

; We designate three "add-trip contexts", according to whether processing of a
; 'cltl-command property by add-trip is assigning a function, a global variable
; (e.g. for defconst), or a macro value.  We refer to the symbol being assigned
; a value as an "add-trip symbol", and we call that value a "relevant value"
; (with respect to that context, which is often implicit) for that symbol.
; Whenever we refer to the add-trip symbols of a book, that reference includes
; add-trip symbols for the book's portcullis commands as well, but not add-trip
; symbols of subsidiary included books.  Note by the way that a *1* function
; symbol can be an add-trip symbol.  The final step after loading a top-level
; compiled file will be to undo the load's assignment of relevant values to
; add-trip symbols.  This step will be done in the cleanup form of an
; unwind-protect, so as to clean up if an error or interrupt occurs during
; loading of the compiled file.  (The clean-up won't be complete for functions
; defined in raw-mode, just as it hasn't been in earlier versions of ACL2 that
; did not load compiled files early.  But raw-mode is ultimately the user's
; responsibility, and we expect problems from such aborts to be rare.)

; We next describe several variables and a constant, which we define before
; include-book-fn.

;   Variables *hcomp-fn-ht*, *hcomp-const-ht*, and *hcomp-macro-ht* are
;   intended to be let-bound to eq hash tables: one for ACL2 user functions and
;   their *1* symbols, one for constants (as with defconst), and one for
;   macros.

;   Variables *hcomp-fn-alist*, *hcomp-const-alist*, and *hcomp-macro-alist*
;   will be be let-bound to alists related to the above hash tables, in senses
;   described below.

;   The variable *hcomp-fake-value* is used as a "fake value", not in any
;   package known in the ACL2 loop, for various purposes below.

;   Variables *hcomp-fn-macro-restore-ht* and *hcomp-macro-restore-ht* are
;   globally bound to hash tables that are populated as books are included,
;   storing existing relevant values (or *hcomp-fake-value* when the relevant
;   value is unbound) for add-trip symbols.

;   A hash table variable, *hcomp-book-ht*, holds other hash tables, as
;   follows.

; A key of *hcomp-book-ht* is a full-book-name.  Values in this hash table are
; hcomp-book-ht-entry records, where each record has a status field that
; describes the attempt to load the book's compiled file, and also has optional
; fields corresponding to values of *hcomp-fn-ht*, *hcomp-const-ht*, and
; *hcomp-macro-ht*.  When ACL2 encounters an include-book form during an early
; raw-Lisp load of an include-book whose full-book-name is not already a key of
; the world's 'include-book-alist or of *hcomp-book-ht*, then include-book
; loads that sub-book's compiled file, hence with new let-bindings of the
; *hcomp-xxx-alist* and *hcomp-xxx-ht* variables, along with unwind protection
; using the *hcomp-xxx-restore-ht* values that can restore relevant values
; after transferring them to those hash tables.  Upon exiting include-book
; successfully, the *hcomp-xxx-ht* variables are associated with the
; full-book-name in *hcomp-book-ht*.

; (Note: One might think that the hash tables one gets by loading the compiled
; file could vary with context, which makes it unreasonable to compute them for
; a sub-book before processing events in the main book.  But as long as the
; book and all books under it remain certified and unchanged, we expect that
; all relevant values depend essentially only on the closure under ancestors of
; the events in the sub-book.)

; We next consider the question of whether it really buys us anything to save
; compiled definitions for defconst and defmacro forms.  The answer is (or can
; be) yes, because macros may have been expanded away.  (See the discussion of
; "minimal compilation" in the Common Lisp Hyperspec: it is defined in
; http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/03_bbb.htm, and it is
; specified for file compilation in #6 of
; http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/03_bca.htm.)  One
; experiment that drives this point home (we have tried GCL and CCL) is the
; following.  Consider the following files, and see the comments in the
; commands below them.

; .................... tmp.lsp ....................
; (in-package "ACL2")
; (defun foo (n)
;   (cond ((zp n) 1)
;         (t (loop for i from 0 to (1- n)
;                  when (equal (foo i) 2)
;                  do (return i))
;            1)))
; (defmacro mac () (foo 27))
; .................... tmp2.lsp ...................
; (in-package "ACL2")
; (load "tmp") ; load compiled file
; (defmacro mac2 () (mac))
; .................... tmp3.lsp ...................
; (in-package "ACL2")
; (load "tmp") ; load compiled file
; (defconst *c* (mac))
; .................................................

; Now do the following (with both CCL-based and GCL-based ACL2 images):

; <Start ACL2>
; :q
; (compile-file "tmp.lsp") ; fast
; (quit)
; <Start ACL2>
; :q
; (load "tmp2.lsp") ; slow definition of mac2
; (compile-file "tmp2.lsp") ; slow
; (load "tmp2") ; fast definition of mac2 from compiled file
; (quit)
; <Start ACL2>
; :q
; (load "tmp2") ; fast definition of mac2 from compiled file
; (quit)
; <Start ACL2>
; :q
; (load "tmp3.lsp") ; slow definition of *c*
; (compile-file "tmp3.lsp") ; fast
; (load "tmp3") ; fast
; (quit)
; <Start ACL2>
; :q
; (load "tmp3") ; slow(GCL)/fast(CCL) def of *c* from compiled file
; (load "tmp3") ; faster (some kind of memoization?)
; (quit)

; We conclude this Part with a discussion of some tricky issues for the case
; that an expansion or compiled file is loaded by include-book, i.e., the case
; that a book is being included with a non-nil effective value of
; :load-compiled-file, where by "effective value" we mean the value after
; accounting for state global 'compiler-enabled.

; A stobj may be defined during evaluation of the raw Lisp definition of
; include-book.  In that case, the-live-name for that stobj is an add-trip
; symbol, and hence its value is stored in *hcomp-const-ht*.  However, the raw
; Lisp definition of defstobj or defabsstobj also assigns to
; *user-stobj-alist*, which we expect will associate the-live-name of a stobj
; with its Lisp relevant value.  Now imagine subsequent processing of events by
; the same include-book.  When defstobj or defabsstobj is encountered, add-trip
; obtains the value of the-live-name of that stobj from *hcomp-const-ht*, and
; uses that value to update *user-stobj-alist* just as it would if it were
; updating without benefit of *hcomp-const-ht*.  The only tricky bit here is
; that we need to ensure that add-trip, along with undo-trip and flush-trip,
; are the only functions that update *user-stobj-alist*.  Therefore, we bind
; *user-stobj-alist* to itself when doing an early load of the compiled file or
; expansion file; see include-book-raw.

; If the compiled file or certificate is missing, or else if the compiled file
; is older than the certificate, we may print a warning and go on, assigning
; 'incomplete status to that book in *hcomp-book-ht* -- but there are a couple
; of exceptions.  If :load-compiled-file is t for the current book or any
; parent include-book in progress (as recorded by special variable
; *load-compiled-stack*), then we cause an error.  If :load-compiled-file is
; not t, then we are content with loading the expansion file in place of the
; compiled file, provided the expansion file is not older than the certificate;
; see load-compiled-book.  In that case we obtain interpreted code when
; add-trip reads a hash table for the value to use, for lisps that do not
; compile on-the-fly; but in that case we are really no worse off than if we
; were computing and evaluating the corresponding definition during event
; processing.

; If however the compiled file is up-to-date with respect to the certificate,
; then we may reasonably assume that the compiled file was valid at one time,
; even if the book is now uncertified.  (We could gain some confidence that the
; book is certified by insisting that the certificate is not older than the
; book.  But some ACL2 users like to update the comments in a book without
; invalidating the certificate.)  We load the compiled file with a suitable
; unwind-protect, restoring relevant values after the load completes (whether
; aborted or not).  If it turns out that the book is uncertified, say because
; its certificate is out-of-date or is for the wrong ACL2 version, we will
; simply avoid using the hash tables computed when loading its compiled file,
; since we don't trust the relevant values stored in those tables.

; What happens if a compiled file is missing for a sub-book (and, if
; :load-compiled-file is not t, the expansion file is also missing)?  Because
; of the possibility of missing packages, at the least, we want to avoid forms
; from the parent book's compiled file (or expansion file -- whichever we are
; loading) that are below the include-book of that sub-book.  So, we abort with
; a throw and a warning, associating the partially-constructed hash tables with
; the parent full-book-name in *hcomp-book-ht*, and leaving it to the cleanup
; form of the surrounding unwind-protect to restore symbol-functions in
; existence before the load of the parent book's compiled file.  Of course, if
; the parent book is itself a sub-book of a book being included, then its
; parent's load is in turn similarly aborted, and so on up the chain.  Note
; that loading the source file in raw Lisp is not an option in general, because
; all of the *hcomp-xxx-alist* setq forms and (hcomp-init) form, not to mention
; that make-event forms in source files are illegal (with the rare exception of
; a consp :check-expansion argument).  Again, the expansion file is a good
; candidate for loading if the compiled file is missing, and this is done in
; order to avoid the aborts described above provided we are not under an
; include-book with :load-compiled-file = t.

; Given a top-level include-book event, it may be helpful to visualize all
; included books and sub-books by arranging them into a tree growing downward,
; with the top-level included book as the root at the top, its sub-books as its
; children from left to right in order of their include-book forms in the
; top-level book, and similarly for sub-books of those sub-books, and
; recursively on downward.  ACL2 will include books with a depth-first
; left-to-right traversal of this tree.  First suppose that the top-level
; include-book form's :load-compile-file argument has an effective value (i.e.,
; accounting for 'compiler-enabled and defaults) other than nil.  At the first
; failure to load a compiled file (either because it is missing or it is out of
; date with respect to the .cert file), all parent books up the tree are
; considered to have incomplete loads of their compiled files.  However, if
; none of these superior books has a :load-compile-file argument with effective
; value of t, then the partially-populated hash tables are considered
; sufficient and the process continues.  To see how warnings and errors are
; handled, suppose we have: book1 includes book2 includes book3 includes book4;
; the compiled file for book4 is missing; and the effective value of
; :load-compile-file for all of these is non-nil.  Then we will see a "Compiled
; file" warning unless either book4 or one of its ancestor books (book1, book2,
; book3) has a :load-compile-file argument of t, in which case an error will
; occur.

; We close this introduction with a partial disclaimer.  The Common Lisp
; Hyperspec does not seem to specify fully which side effects may be caused by
; DEFUN.  Thus, although our approach will install symbol-functions, there
; seems to be no guarantee that it will allow other side-effects caused by
; DEFUN.  No such side-effect is critical for ACL2.  Nevertheless, it is
; fortunate that some such side-effects may still be handled, as illustrated by
; the following experiment in CCL.  First, load a compiled definition of
; function foo from a compiled file, save the symbol-function of foo in
; variable xxx, evaluate (fmakunbound 'foo), and then evaluate (setf
; (symbol-function 'foo) xxx).  After all this: if the defun of foo has a Lisp
; documentation string, then (documentation 'foo 'function) will still return
; that string; and if moreover ccl::*save-source-locations* is t, then
; (disassemble 'foo) will give the same nice result both before the fmakunbound
; and after the setf.

; We turn next to describing how compiled (and expansion) files are used when
; including a certified book.  We defer to Part 3 an explanation of how
; expansion files are created (and thus, how compiled files are created) during
; book certification.

; In this essay, while we occasionally mention the use of raw mode within a
; book, presumably within a progn! form in the presence of a trust tag, we do
; not consider explicitly the evaluation of include-book forms in raw Lisp.
; This case is simpler than evaluation of include-book forms in the ACL2 loop;
; for example, the value of *hcomp-book-ht* is irrelevant for include-book
; performed in raw mode.

; Part 2: Including a certified book

; Fix a book for the following discussion.  An add-trip symbol is "qualified"
; if whenever add-trip is to assign a relevant value by including the book in a
; boot-strap world, that value is equal to relevant value of the symbol if
; instead the compiled file is loaded.  An add-trip symbol is "semi-qualified"
; if instead add-trip assigns a relevant value exactly twice, where the second
; value equals the relevant value of the symbol at the time the compiled file
; has just been loaded.  This can happen if, and we believe only if (unless
; trust tags or make-event with non-nil :check-expansion are involved), the
; symbol is a *1* function symbol that is defined first in :program mode and
; then in :logic mode, say with verify-termination.  We call an add-trip symbol
; "unqualified" if it is neither qualified nor semi-qualified.

; Include-book processes the book's compiled file using the following sequence
; of steps.  (See also the summary shortly below this description.)

; First, include-book loads the compiled file:

; (1) Each *hcomp-xxx-alist* is an alist assigned by a form (setq
;     *hcomp-xxx-alist* (quote ...)) near the top of the expansion file, after
;     the initial (in-package "ACL2") but before the portcullis commands.  This
;     alist associates values with (and only with) all add-trip symbols: t for
;     qualified, 'semi for semi-qualified, and nil for unqualified.  Note that
;     the values of these setq forms are quoted (laid down during book
;     certification); hence the values of these globals are independent of the
;     environment in which the compiled file is loaded.  We use setq rather
;     than defparameter because we have seen defparameter result in a slowdown
;     of two orders of magnitude in CCL in doing the early load of compiled
;     files.

; (2) Function hcomp-init is called (at load time), to do two things.  For one,
;     it adds to the *hcomp-xxx-restore-ht* hash tables, so that for each
;     add-trip symbol that is not already a key of the suitable such hash
;     table, that symbol is associated with its relevant value, if it has one,
;     and otherwise is associated with a special "unbound" value,
;     *hcomp-fake-value*.  Also, it populates each *hcomp-xxx-ht* by
;     associating each qualified add-trip symbol with t and each semi-qualified
;     add-trip symbol with 'semi.  Note that while the set of add-trip symbols
;     (as well as their status as qualified, semi-qualified, or unqualified) is
;     determined when the compiled file is written, the determination of
;     relevant values written to *hcomp-xxx-alist* is done at load time.  Also
;     note that the domain of each *hcomp-xxx-alist*, representing the set of
;     add-trip symbols, is the same as in Step (1).

; (3) Relevant values are assigned by loading the remainder of the compiled
;     file, which starts with the portcullis commands.  These are wrapped in a
;     progn to maximize sharing using #n# syntax.

; Note however that the load may abort with a throw as described earlier above
; (missing compiled file for a sub-book).  We'll catch any such throw before
; proceeding with the next step.

; (4) Evaluation of the form (hcomp-transfer-to-hash-tables) updates the
;     *hcomp-xxx-ht* hash tables for use by add-trip, as follows.  Let sym be
;     an add-trip symbol with relevant value val and "qualified" status as
;     determined by *hcomp-xxx-alist*.  If sym is qualified, then sym is
;     associated in *hcomp-xxx-ht* with val.  Otherwise, if sym is
;     semi-qualified, then sym is associated with the so-called "reclassifying
;     value" (*hcomp-fake-value* . val).  Otherwise, sym is not a key of the
;     hash table.

; After attempting to load all compiled (or expansion) files under a top-level
; such load, ACL2 executes the following step as it cleans up using
; unwind-protection; see include-book-raw-top.

; (5) Relevant values are restored (which could mean making some symbols have
;     undefined relevant values) for all add-trip symbols, regardless of
;     "qualified" status, to what they were before Step (3), using the
;     *hcomp-xxx-restore-ht* alists from Step (2).

; In summary, our alist and hash table globals have values as follows during
; the process of including a certified book.  (NOTE that they have different
; values during the process of book certification, as discussed in Part 3
; below.)

; *hcomp-xxx-alist*
;   -- Before evaluating hcomp-init (near the top of the expansion file):
;      Associates each add-trip symbol with t if qualified, 'semi if
;      semi-qualified and otherwise nil

; *hcomp-xxx-ht*
;   -- After evaluating hcomp-init (near the top of the expansion file):
;      Assigns each qualified add-trip symbol to t and each semi-qualified
;      add-trip symbol to 'semi (and these are the only keys)
;   -- After loading compiled definitions, hcomp-transfer-to-hash-tables is
;      called to populate *hcomp-xxx-ht* by associating a value with each
;      qualified or semi-qualified add-trip symbol that has a relevant value,
;      val (and only in those cases), as follows:
;      + a qualified symbol is bound to val
;      + a semi-qualified symbol is bound to the so-called "reclassifying
;        value" (*hcomp-fake-value* . val), where val is a :logic mode *1*
;        definition

; *hcomp-xxx-restore-ht*
;   -- After completing a top-level load of a compiled (or expansion) file:
;      Associates each add-trip symbol with its relevant value if any, else to
;      *hcomp-fake-value*

; So, how is a relevant value assigned to an add-trip symbol when including a
; certified book?  If the symbol is qualified, then its value is obtained from
; the relevant *hcomp-xxx-ht* hash table.  Otherwise add-trip proceeds without
; the help of that hash table.  However, if the symbol is assigned a
; reclassifying value (*hcomp-fake-value* . val) in the hash table, then even
; though add-trip does not use that value to assign a relevant value, the
; symbol is reassigned to val in the hash table; so if and when subsequently
; this *1* symbol is assigned a :logic-mode value by add-trip it will be val,
; i.e., the symbol will be treated as qualified.  That is appropriate because
; if add-trip assigns a new value -- and assuming that redefinition is off,
; which it is unless there is a trust tag -- then the subsequent :logic mode
; definition will be ready for this saved value.

; If raw-mode is entered, then loading the compiled file can assign relevant
; values to symbols other than add-trip symbols.  (By the way, we are not
; talking here about memoize and unmemoize, even when #+hons, because these are
; no-ops in raw Lisp.)  Upon completion of the above sequence of five steps,
; new relevant values are only assigned for symbols that are not add-trip
; symbols, since as specified in Step (5) above, relevant values for add-trip
; symbols are restored from the *hcomp-xxx-restore-ht* variables after loading
; the compiled files.  Users need to manage raw-mode carefully with respect to
; loading compiled files when including a book.

; If future enhancements are to allow add-trip to assign more than one relevant
; value for other than *1* symbols, we expect to be able to deal with such
; cases.  If there can in fact be more than two such assignments for the same
; symbol, we can replace a reclassifying value (cons *hcomp-fake-value* val) by
; something like (list* *hcomp-fake-value* count val), where count is initially
; the number of expected re-assignments, it is decremented with each
; assignment, and only when it would be about to decrement to 0 would we
; actually use the hash table's value.  Note that some of the initial
; assignments made during certify-book might not be made during include-book,
; because of redundancy, so the last value is the only one that can reliably be
; assigned (if the count ever gets down to 1).

; Part 3: Writing an expansion file for compilation

; We next consider the writing of the expansion file by certify-book.  This
; process has three main steps.  The first main step is storing relevant values
; in the *hcomp-xxx-ht* hash tables both based on the certification world and
; during the process-embedded-events call during the include-book pass of
; certify-book.  The second main step then determines the value of each
; *hcomp-xxx-alist* for the setq forms to be written to the expansion file.
; The third main step actually writes forms to the expansion file.  We now
; consider these in turn.  Note that we do not access the *hcomp-xxx-alist*
; variables; their part in writing an expansion file is only to occur
; syntactically in the setq forms.

; The first main step populates each *hcomp-xxx-ht*.  We begin by let-binding
; each *hcomp-xxx-ht* to its own eq hash table.  Then we populate these hash
; tables -- first using the portcullis commands of the certification world,
; then during the process-embedded-events phase of include-book-fn -- updating
; the appropriate hash table for each symbol that is assigned a relevant value
; (because of a 'cltl-command property) by add-trip.  (In the case of the
; portcullis commands, we do not actually run add-trip, but rather we mirror
; its necessary effects in function hcomp-build-from-state.)  When we
; encounter a symbol that is not already a key of that hash table, then we
; associate it with its relevant value.  Otherwise, if the symbol is a *1*
; symbol that already has a value that is not a reclassifying value, and it is
; now being converted from :program to :logic mode, then the symbol is
; associated with the reclassifying value (*hcomp-fake-value* . val), where val
; is its current relevant value.  Otherwise the symbol is other than a *1*
; symbol and already has a relevant value -- presumably something unusual has
; occurred by virtue of a trust tag -- and the symbol is associated with
; *hcomp-fake-value*.  Note (in particular for the #+hons version) that memoize
; and unmemoize events do not have any effect on the populating of
; *hcomp-xxx-ht*.

; The second main step takes place after the return from
; process-embedded-events, and considers each symbol, sym, and associated value
; in the appropriate *hcomp-xxx-ht*.  If the value is a reclassifying value
; (*hcomp-fake-value* . val) and val equals the current relevant value of sym,
; then sym is semi-qualified and is therefore to be associated with 'semi in
; *hcomp-xxx-alist*.  For any other value, val, besides *hcomp-fake-value*,
; such that val equals the current relevant value of sym, then sym is qualified
; and is therefore to be associated with t in *hcomp-xxx-alist*.  Otherwise VAL
; is unqualified and hence is to be associated with nil in *hcomp-xxx-alist*
; (see function hcomp-alists-from-hts for the check against the current
; relevant value).  This last case is likely to be rather unusual, but can
; happen in the #+hons case if memoization occurs after a definition without
; being followed by unmemoization (more on this in the next paragraph).  It can
; also happen if a function is redefined in raw-mode, though of course a trust
; tag is needed in that case; but we do not guarantee perfect handling of
; raw-mode, as there might be no raw-mode redefinition during the include-book
; phase of book certification and yet there might be raw-mode redefinition
; later during inclusion of the certified book -- anyhow, uses of raw-mode are
; the user's responsibility.  If not for raw-mode, we might simply avoid any
; check and consider every add-trip symbol to be qualified or semi-qualified;
; memoization isn't a problem, since memoize is a no-op in raw Lisp and hash
; tables are populated during early include-books performed in raw Lisp.

; Note that we take a conservative approach, where memoization can make a
; symbol unqualified.  The consequence seems small, since as of this writing,
; memoization is only done in the #+hons version, which is only for ACL2 built
; on CCL, and CCL compiles on-the-fly; so the marking of an add-trip symbol as
; unqualified will not result in interpreted code.  A future optimization might
; be to to avoid disqualification due to memoization in suitable cases, perhaps
; by tracking raw-mode or trust tags, or perhaps by somehow taking advantage of
; the 'old-fn field of the *memoize-info-ht* entry.

; It is instructive to consider the case that a :program mode definition is
; redundant with an earlier :logic mode definition made in the book (or its
; portcullis commands), either directly or by way of a redundant encapsulate,
; as per the following example from Jared Davis:

; (encapsulate () (defun f (x) (declare (xargs :mode :program)) x))
; (verify-termination f)
; (encapsulate () (defun f (x) (declare (xargs :mode :program)) x))

; Recall that the *1* functions written to the expansion file are based on the
; definitional event installed at the end of the include-book phase of
; certify-book.  In this case, that will be the :logic mode definition; the
; redundant event is properly ignored.

; The third main step, writing forms to the expansion file, is rather
; straightforward based on the discussion above.  We bind the current package
; to "ACL2", and then write a sequence of forms as follows.

; - (in-package "ACL2")

; - Forms that introduce packages that may be needed for reading symbols in the
;   initial setq forms.  These are introduced using maybe-introduce-empty-pkg-1
;   and maybe-introduce-empty-pkg-2.  The maybe-introduce-empty-pkg-1 forms
;   introduce all the packages together, just under the initial in-package
;   form, thus avoiding a warning from GCL that can occur unless all defpackage
;   forms immediately follow the initial in-package form.  The
;   maybe-introduce-empty-pkg-2 forms use special variable *defpkg-virgins* to
;   let ACL2 know to accept subsequent corresponding defpkg forms.

; - Setq forms for the *hcomp-xxx-alist* variables as described above
;   (hcomp-init)

; - Declaim forms (if any)

; - The portcullis commands

(defun hcomp-init ()

; For context, see the Essay on Hash Table Support for Compilation.

; This function is called during loading of a compiled or expansion file by
; include-book, immediately after assigning alists to the *hcomp-xxx-alist*
; globals.  The keys of each alist are the add-trip symbols for its type,
; associating value t if qualified, 'semi if semi-qualified, else nil.  This
; function does two things.  First, for each of the three alists, it puts an
; entry into the corresponding *hcomp-xxx-alist* hash table, for each key bound
; to non-nil in the alist.  Second, it updates *hcomp-fn-restore-ht* to support
; the eventual restoration of relevant values for add-trip symbols.  For
; details, see the Essay on Hash Table Support for Compilation.

; The problem was that truename is (one might say) broken in Allegro CL.
; Fortunately, Allegro CL provides an alternative that seems to work --
; excl::pathname-resolve-symbolic-links -- and we now use that function (see
; our-truename).  The problem goes away if that function is applied to
; full-book-name under the call of assoc-equal below.  But the error occurred
; in the context of loading a file just compiled from a book, and in that
; context there is no reason to execute any raw-Lisp include-book.  Thus, we
; short-circuit in that case -- see the use of *compiling-certified-file* above
; -- and now we never even get to the above assoc-equal test in that case.

; A final comment in the case that we really do get to this point:

; Since all relevant values have been defined, there is no need to transfer to
; hash tables (as per the Essay on Hash Table Support for Compilation).  This
; is the case even if we loaded in raw-mode.  It would be harmless enough to
; load in the raw-mode case, and could be desirable if values are
; context-dependent and it is expected that we re-load, but for now we avoid
; the inefficiency of repeated loads.

; end of the code for this function).

  (global-symbol (car trip))

; Defun-mode non-nil is stored by DEFUNS and defun-mode nil by :non-executable
; DEFUNS and by ENCAPSULATE when it is defining the constrained fns.
; Oneify-cltl-code relies on the fact that functions with defun-mode nil do a
; THROW.

; Observe that we sometimes use oneify-cltl-code to modify the actual Common
; Lisp code.  Why don't we modify the defi before storing the cltl-command
; tuple?  Because we want to make it easy on ourselves to recover from the
; world the actual defi used to define :program mode functions.  See
; verify-termination.

; Recall that ignorep is non-nil if we are to AVOID storing the
; symbol-functions for names.  If ignorep is non-nil, then it is either
; reclassifying  -- meaning we are reclassifying a symbol from :program
;                   to :logic mode.  We don't want to overwrite its
;                   symbol-function since that might be ACL2 source code.
;                   We still write a *1* definition in this case.
; (defstobj . stobj)
;                -- meaning the names being introduced are actually being
;                   defun'd under (defstobj stobj ...) or (defabsstobj stobj
;                   ...).  We don't want to store the code generated by defun
;                   for these names because defstobj and defabsstobj will
;                   generate a CLTL-COMMAND containing the made-to-order raw
;                   defs.  We also do not store the *1* definition in this
;                   case, because in CCL (at least) this would cause a problem
;                   since the *1* code calls the raw Lisp function, which has
;                   not yet been defined and in the :inline case is actually a
;                   macro.  (See also the comment in defstobj-functionsp.)

; Why do we need the stobj name in the case of ignorep = '(defstobj . stobj)?
; The reason is that when we generate the *1* code for the function, fn, we
; must generate a throw to handle a guard violation and the argument to that
; throw is an object which includes, among other things, the stobjs-in of fn so
; we will know how to print them.  You might think we would get the stobjs-in
; of fn from the world.  But we can't because this defun is being done under,
; and as part of, a defstobj or defabsstobj event, and the event will later
; declare stobj to be a stobj name.  So the stobjs-in of fn in the world right
; now is wrong.  The stobjs-in we need is built into the object thrown and so
; won't be overwritten when the event gets around to declaring stobj a stobj.
; So oneify-cltl-code, called below, takes the stobj name as its input and
; computes the appropriate stobjs-in from the formals.  This is a problem
; analogous to the one addressed by the super-defun-wart table.

; compilation for GCL, where we have seen build time shrink from over 22 to
; under 7 minutes and have seen roughly a percent or slightly less degradation
; in regression time, probably because of the lack of compilation in that case
; of *1* functions for built-in :program mode functions.  But we have decided,
; at least for now, to keep the code simple by doing the same thing for all
; lisps and be happy with even that small improvement in regression time for
; GCL.  (Note that by using make with
;   LISP='gcl -eval "(defparameter user::*fast-acl2-gcl-build* t)"'
; one can get a faster build, without this on-the-fly compilation, with very
; little performance penalty at runtime.  Something like this could be done
; with any Common Lisp, but there is only a point in GCL; see above.)

; Historical remark on defconstant.

; In the beginning we supported defconstant.  We changed to
; defparameter and then changed to defconst.  As things stand now,
; ACL2 supports defconst, which has the same effect at the raw lisp
; level (i.e., the cltl-command) as defparameter, and in addition
; causes proclaim-file to execute an appropriate proclamation for the
; parameter, knowing as we do that it is really constant.  Here are
; some historical remarks that explain why we have gone down this
; path.

; "Currently we turn defconstants into defparameters at the raw Lisp
; level (that is, the cltl-command for defconstant is a defparameter).
; However, we have begun to contemplate alternatives, as we now
; explain.

; We have run into the following problem with defconstant:  the
; compiler won't let us compile certified books containing defconstant
; forms because it thinks that constants are special variables
; (because that is what the defparameter cltl-command does).  What can
; we do about this problem?  One idea was to temporarily redefine
; defconstant to be defparameter (during the compilation done by
; certify-book), but macrolet has only lexical scope, and anyhow Boyer
; says that it's illegal to redefine a Common Lisp function (as we did
; using setf, macro-function, and unwind-protect).

; Another possibility is to change defconstant-fn so that it really
; does create defconstants.  But the reason we use defparameter now is
; that when we undo we need to unbind (because we're always checking
; to see if something is already bound), and we can't unbind a
; constant.

; Why not just eliminate defconstant in favor of defparameter
; everywhere?  This is very appealing, especially because defconstant
; is inherently not amenable to undoing.  But, Boyer thinks that when
; you defconstant something to a value that is a fixnum, then the
; compiler knows it's a fixnum.  This could be very important for
; speed in type-set reasoning.  Without the consideration of
; arithmetic, Schelter thinks that we're only paying the price of two
; memory references for defparameter vs. one for defconstant; but a
; factor of 80 or so seems like too high a price to pay.

; So, how about allowing both defconstant and defparameter, but not
; allowing any undoing back past a defconstant?  After all, we already
; have a notion of not undoing into the system initialization, so
; we're just talking about a very reasonable extension of that
; protocol.  One problem with this approach is that certify-book
; currently does an include-book after a ubt, and this ubt would
; probably fail.  But perhaps we can force this to work.  The user
; could then develop his work using defparameter, but certify the
; final "toothbrush" book using defconstant.  Perhaps defconst would
; be a convenient macro that could be redefined so as to be one or the
; other of defparameter or defconstant.  With this approach it would
; probably be useful to require answering a query in order to execute
; a defconstant.

; Another option would be to have acl2::defconstant be distinct from
; lisp::defconstant, but as Boyer points out, this violates our desire
; to have such Lisp primitives available to the user that he can count
; on.  Or, we could define a new package that's just like the acl2
; package but doesn't import defconstant.  But note that
; (symbol-package 'defconstant) would create different answers in the
; ACL2 package than in this package -- ouch!"

; operations execute this form on the cleanup1 side of acl2-unwind-protects,
; after saving in locals the name and world before they start making changes to
; the symbol- plists.  Our recovery mechanism has two steps.  First, we throw
; away all properties stored under the name in question.  Second, we extend
; that empty world to the saved one.  The extension part is easy.

; But how do we "throw away all properties" stored under a given name?  One way
; is to get the world key, world-key, associated with the name, and then visit
; each CLTL symbol, sym, and do (remprop sym world-key).  But sweeping through
; all symbols seems to be slow.  So instead we enforce the discipline of having
; a "universal list" of all the symbols which might, remotely, have the
; world-key property.  This list is actually a list of triples (it is, in fact,
; always one of the two worlds involved in the aborted operation) and we visit
; the symbol in each car of each triple.

; So much for spoon-fed background information.  Name is the name of the world
; whose installation was aborted.  We know that the cdr of the 'acl2-world-pair
; property of name is some uninterned symbol, world-key, at which all the
; properties for this world are stored.  Old-wrld is the alist of triples that
; was actually installed at the time the aborted operation was initiated -- and
; is thus the world we are going to re-install.  And universe is a list of
; pairs (triples actually) with the following two properties:

; (a) at the time of any abort during the critical section, each symbol having
; the world-key property occurs as the car of some pair in universe, and (b)
; each symbol occurring as the car of some pair in old-wrld occurs as the car of
; a pair in universe.

; The latter property is necessary to ensure that we can recover from an
; aborted attempt to recover.

; In addition, if operation is 'retraction, then pkg is the current- package at
; the inception of the operation.  If operation is not 'retraction, pkg is
; irrelevant.

; This program sweeps the world and makes sure that the current acl2 world key
; is the first property on every property list upon which it is found.  We try
; to maintain that invariant in set-w where we always move the property up when
; we mess with a symbol's plist.  Of course, one must then wonder why this
; program is ever useful.  The reason is that in some lisps, e.g., AKCL, when
; you ask for the symbol-name of a symbol it has the side-effect of storing the
; string on the plist for future use.  Thus, for example, during booting of
; ACL2 we keep the world key at the front but then when we print the name of
; the event we accidentally cover the world key up with a SYSTEM:PNAME
; property.  This doesn't happen for every name.  Apparently for most we access
; the symbol-name during the processing and cause the property to come into
; existence and then store our world key in front of it.  But for some names we
; don't, apparently, ever access the symbol-name during processing and then our
; world key is covered up the first time the name is printed by ACL2.  Among
; the names so covered up by system properties are the names such as |Make
; RECOGNIZER-TUPLE record| INCLUDE-BOOK-ALIST, CERTIFICATION-TUPLE,
; TYPE-SET-INVERTER-RULES, PROVED-FUNCTIONAL-INSTANCES-ALIST, GENERALIZE-RULES,
; WELL-FOUNDED-RELATION-ALIST, WORLD-GLOBALS, and CHK-NEW-NAME-LST.  It is my
; theory that these names are simply never set a second time in booting and
; their initial setting is made before they are first printed.

; In any case, the following sweep takes only a second or two at the end of a
; boot and will make our world key the first property.  We hope to keep it that
; way in add-trip, but we cannot guarantee it, since the Lisp system might
; legally at anytime cover it up with some system property.

; Certain defconsts are problematic because they build in values that one
; cannot know until the system is built!  Getting their values right requires
; some thought or experiment and even then subsequent changes to the system can
; render the values incorrect.  To guard against incorrect (obsolete) values
; for these constants, this function causes an error if doesn't like what it
; sees.  We document only one such constant, *force-xnume*, which more or less
; describes the situation suffered by all of them.

; Our Code requires that *force-xnume* be the nume of (:EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART
; FORCE).  It would be nice to be able to write: (defconst *force-xnume*
; (fn-rune-nume 'force t t (w state))).  But that suffers TWO problems.  The
; first is that defconst disallows the use of any variable in the initial value
; form.  Thus, state is illegal above.  We tried fixing that, in a hypocritical
; way, by allowing it to ourselves in boot-strap even though we denied it to
; the user.  But even that doesn't work because of the second problem: The
; first time the defconst is processed, no numes are being allocated because
; everything is done in the :program defun-mode.  You might think, therefore,
; we ought to delay the execution of this defconst until after we've done the
; second pass and created the rune in question.  But we cannot do that because
; we use *force-xnume* in our code (namely, in ok-to-force) and that function
; can't be defined until *force-xnume* is defined.  Thus, this seemingly
; hackish way of doing it, where we actually specify ahead of time which nume
; will be assigned, is not as outlandish as it might at first seem.  We check
; that the actual assignment is correct (using this function) after booting.

; First we do a check on *boot-strap-invariant-risk-symbols* and
; *boot-strap-invariant-risk-symbols*.

; This function first lds all of the *acl2-files*, except

; (which is the default default-defun-mode).  It then loads the files in
; acl2-pass-2-files in :logic mode.

; During the first pass, ld-skip-proofsp is 'initialize-acl2, which is like the
; setting t (doing syntactic checks but skipping proofs and LOCALs) but omits a
; few of the checks so the bootstrapping can be done.  During the second pass,
; ld-skip-proofsp is as specified by the &optional parameter above.  It
; defaults to 'include-book, which means we skip LOCALs, all syntactic checks,
; and proofs.  By calling this function with pass-2-ld-skip-proofsp nil you can
; arrange for it to try to prove its way through the second pass.  However, see
; below.

; Why Two Passes?  By doing things in two passes we make it possible to use all
; system functions in hints and other proof commands.  In the one-pass
; initialization we used to use, it was impossible to use theory expressions in
; the defthms in axioms.lisp because the necessary theory functions were not
; yet defined and so trans-eval balked on them.

; Interactive Proofs: Many times, (initialize-acl2 nil) -- which causes the
; system to prove the admissibility of everything done in the second pass --
; will fail because insufficient lemmas are available to handle new functions
; added since the last such proof.  But it will leave you in a state so that
; you can continue to develop proofs.  In particular, if you have changed some
; of the proved code, e.g., axioms.lisp, and you wish to re-verify it, you can
; proceed as follows.  First, fire up akcl.  Then do (acl2::load-acl2).
; Finally do (initialize-acl2 nil) and wait for the first proof to fail.  When
; it fails you will be returned to lisp.  There, in raw lisp, you should
; execute
;   (let ((state *the-live-state*))
;    (reset-ld-specials t)
; ;  (set-ld-redefinition-action '(:doit! . :overwrite) state) ;see below
;    )
; This will set the ld-specials to their conventional post-boot-strap setting,
; except (possibly) for ld-redefinition-action which will allow redefinition.
; (We discuss this more below.)  Then enter the loop with (LP!), which will set
; *features* to include :acl2-loop-only in case read conditionals are present
; in the sources you wish to develop.  Once in the loop, you should be able to
; continue as normal with proof development.

; If the initialization did not get beyond pass one, :q is undefined and the
; only way to exit is to do (mv nil :q state).  You will also note that other
; keyword commands, e.g., :pc, are unavailable.  You can always execute the
; appropriate form in raw lisp, e.g.,

; (let ((state *the-live-state*)) (pc 'fn))

; If you did get beyond pass one, things will be pretty normal looking except
; that inspection will show that both (global-val 'boot-strap-flg (w state))
; and (global-val 'boot-strap-pass-2 (w state)) are t.  This will manifest
; itself in some perhaps surprising ways during interactive proofs, e.g.,
; redundant deflabels are admitted during the second pass.

; Is Redefinition Permission Necessary?  Not always.  If you are re-verifying
; the sources the chances are you've changed something.  Suppose some event is
; no longer admissible.  If you have to change a function definition to admit
; it, i.e., one of your new events is incorrectly written, then redefinition
; permission is necessary because what you are trying to do is NOT just a
; simple reclassifying (you're changing the definition).  If on the other hand
; you are not changing definitions but adding them, you need not perform the
; set-ld-redefinition-action shown above.  A conservative thing to do is to
; leave the redefinition action nil and not set it until necessary.

; How do I Add a New Function Definition?  If you try to add to the sources a
; new function definition while in pass one of the initialization it will fail
; because we insist that all functions defined logically already have raw lisp
; definitions.  You should define the function first in raw lisp (by exiting
; the LP!) and then in the loop.  If you discovered this problem by provoking
; the hard error: ACL2 Error in ACL2-INTERFACE: fn is not fboundp! then you
; must first exit the lisp break with :q.  This will revert the world and throw
; you out of the LP!.  The world is as it was before the offensive definition,
; so you should define the function in raw lisp, reenter LP! and proceed as
; intended.

; The Special State Discussion: We bind state to *the-live-state* below because
; the macro expansion of ld introduces the variable state.  Once upon a time we
; declared state special with (defparameter state *the-live-state*) in this
; file.  But that had the effect of preventing tail-recursion removal in
; situations like (pprogn (princ$ ...) (recursive-call ...)) because pprogn
; macro expands to a binding of state and you can't jump out of a binding of a
; special in tail recursion (it is only allowed if it is lexical).  Thus, we
; got the curious and frustrating problem that if we recompiled system
; functions (like print-doc-string-part1) then they would no longer have tail
; recursions removed, even though the recursion would be so removed when we
; made the system from scratch.  (Reiterating the reason: between the two
; compilations of the function, state became special.  Had we declared state
; special in axioms.lisp instead of here in interface-raw.lisp, none of
; tail-recursion removal on state changing functions would have been done!)  We
; no longer make state special and hence must bind it to *the-live-state*
; lexically when its use is unavoidable.  In point of fact we now evaluate
; (setq state *the-live-state*) in (load-acl2), without making state special,
; and hence state may be used in raw Lisp after the system is loaded as long as
; the form using state is not compiled.

; Finally: another way to prove your way through axioms.lisp is to invoke
; (acl2::load-acl2) and (initialize-acl2), then save the system (e.g., in akcl
; execute (si::save-system "my-saved_acl2")), and now each time you invoke that
; saved image first execute

; (defconst *acl2-pass-2-files* '())

; in raw Lisp (or, execute this before saving the image), and then after
; executing (LP!) submit the form

; (set-w 'extension (global-set 'boot-strap-pass-2 t (w state)) state)

; to ACL2 in order to allow system DEFLABELs to be considered redundant.

; Save perhaps 12K in image.

; In Lispworks, we spawn a thread for the listener before we exit lp for the

; strategy is derived from the following quote, from Martin Simmons, of
; Lispworks.
;
; "If you want it to run a normal REPL, then you could call
; lw:start-tty-listener when acl2::lp returns.  That will make a new thread
; running the REPL, which will prevent multiprocessing from stopping."
;
; Another strategy, which was never released, involved following the
; multiprocessing example in section 15.13 of the Lispworks 6.0 manual.  To
; quickly outline that strategy, we (1) renamed "lp" to "lp1", (2) defined "lp"
; to spawn a thread that called "lp1", (3) saved the Lispworks image with the
; ":multiprocessing t" flag, and (4) ensured that the Lispworks image's restart
; function was acl2-default-restart-function, which called "lp".
;
; We feel that Martin's suggested implementation is simpler, and so we
; use that.
;
; We rely on the following property of lw:start-tty-listener: if the tty
; listener is already running, calling lw:start-tty-listener does nothing.

(defconstant *our-standard-io*

; We bind *debug-io* to this constant inside LP to ensure that when the
; debugger is invoked, it will write to the standard output rather than to the
; terminal (unless *debug-io* is rebound, as in community books file
; books/centaur/vl2014/server/server-raw.lsp).  Formerly we bound *debug-io* to
; *standard-output* in LP, which would cause an infinite loop in the SBCL
; debugger as described below.  We thank Keshav Kini for the current approach,
; and for bringing this problem to our attention.  As described below, this
; approach ensures that debugger output is printed to standard output, not to
; the terminal, but without binding *debug-io* to an output-only stream.

; Below is some discussion showing how we formerly got this wrong and
; progressed towards the current solution.  Before making changes
; related to this constant, be sure to understand the issues raised in
; that discussion.

; (1) Git commit 26013676ec22cd68e29be0a43f9cbf2aeee2114e on Feb 5, 2016
;     provided a fix for problem described in the following quote from :doc
;     note-7-3.

;       It was possible for a backtrace to be printed to the terminal by SBCL
;       and CMUCL, even when output is redirected to a file. This has been
;       fixed.

;     The fix was for ACL2 function print-call-history to print backtraces to
;     *standard-output*, rather than to the default stream, *debug-io*.
;
; BUT that fix caused a problem:
;
; (2) Commit 6d7ad53ecdaaec9dcf3e3d05c19832b97fa7062a on Aug 26, 2016 provided
;     a fix for GitHub Issue 634 (https://github.com/acl2/acl2/issues/634),
;     namely, printing of a backtrace to the terminal.  The problem had been
;     that for SBCL (and CMUCL), print-call-history was sending its output to
;     *standard-output* instead of *debug-io*, so the rebinding of *debug-io*
;     in community books file books/centaur/vl2014/server/server-raw.lsp had no
;     effect on where print-call-history sent its output: that output was going
;     to *standard-output*, hence to a .cert.out file.  The fix was to avoid
;     the use of *standard-output* in print-call-history, instead binding
;     *debug-io* to *standard-output* in LP.  That solution still handles (1)
;     by sending backtraces to *standard-output* by default; but now, the
;     redirection in server-raw.lsp, by rebinding *debug-io*, works as
;     intended.

; BUT that fix caused a problem: with *debug-io* bound to *standard-output*, a
; horrible infinite loop could occur in SBCL when trying to read from
; *debug-io*, as shown in this item, formerly in community books file
; books/system/to-do.txt, for obtaining that infinite loop in ACL2 but not in
; pure SBCL:

; (value :q)
; (LP!) ; only in ACL2
; #+acl2-loop-only (program)
; (defun foo (x) (declare (optimize (safety 0))) (car x))
; #+acl2-loop-only (set-debugger-enable t)
; (foo 3)
;
; So now, in LP we bind *debug-io* to *our-standard-io* instead of
; *standard-output*, thus guaranteeing that debugger output is sent to standard
; output rather than the terminal, without the mistake of binding *debug-io* to
; an output-only stream.

; This function can only be called from within raw lisp, because no ACL2
; function mentions it.  Thus, we assume we are in raw lisp.  This is the
; top-level entry to ACL2.  Note that truename can cause an error in some
; Common Lisps when the given file or directory does not exist, in which case
; our-truename will generally return nil.  Hence, we sometimes call
; our-truename on "" rather than on a file name.

; for GCL we still compile built-in :program mode *1* functions after all, by
; writing out a huge TMP1.lisp file (8.3 MB instead 0.4 MB).

; #+gcl t #-gcl

; But this made things worse.  Here are examples for v2-9-1 (on the way to

; 9827.570u 149.730s 2:52:29.27 96.4%   0+0k 0+0io 14549410pf+0w

; During the build, do not compile :program mode functions until the end

; Moreover, the saved_acl2.gcl file went from 43 MB, for the first two, to 104
; MB for the last.  So let's not write :program mode *1* functions to
; TMP1.lisp.  See the long comment about *fast-acl2-gcl-build* in add-trip.

; undo the effects of set-gc-strategy-builtin-egc, by turning off EGC and

; contain the symbol set-and-reset-gc-thresholds after this call succeeds.

; The function ccl-initialize-gc-strategy should be called before this function
; is called.

; This function should probably not be invoked in recent versions of CCL,
; instead relying on EGC for memory management, except perhaps in
; static-hons-intensive applications.  See *acl2-egc-on*.

;          Sol Swords's scheme to control GC in CCL
;
; The goal is to get CCL to perform a GC whenever we're using almost
; all the physical memory, but not otherwise.
;
; The discussion below is self-contained, but for more discussion, relevant CCL
; documentation is at http://ccl.clozure.com/ccl-documentation.html, Chapter
; 16: "Understanding and Configuring the Garbage Collector".  Note that it
; might be easier to read the comment in source function
; set-and-reset-gc-thresholds before reading below.

; The usual way of controlling GC on CCL is via LISP-HEAP-GC-THRESHOLD.  This
; value is approximately the amount of free memory that will be allocated
; immediately after GC.  This means that the next GC will occur after
; LISP-HEAP-GC-THRESHOLD more bytes are used (by consing or array allocation or
; whatever).  But this means the total memory used by the time the next GC
; comes around is the threshold plus the amount that remained in use at the end
; of the previous GC.  This is a problem because of the following scenario:
;
;  - We set the LISP-HEAP-GC-THRESHOLD to 3GB since we'd like to be able
;    to use most of the 4GB physical memory available.
;
;  - A GC runs or we say USE-LISP-HEAP-GC-THRESHOLD to ensure that 3GB
;    is available to us.
;
;  - We run a computation until we've exhausted this 3GB, at which point
;    a GC occurs.
;
;  - The GC reclaims 1.2 GB out of the 3GB used, so there is 1.8 GB
;    still in use.
;
;  - After GC, 3GB more is automatically allocated -- but this means we
;    won't GC again until we have 4.8 GB in use, meaning we've gone to
;    swap.
;
; What we really want is, instead of allocating a constant additional
; amount after each GC, to allocate up to a fixed total amount including
; what's already in use.  To emulate that behavior, we use the hack
; below.  This operates as follows, assuming the same 4GB total physical
; memory as in the above example (or, unknown physical memory that defaults to
; 4GB as shown below, i.e., when function meminfo returns 0).
;
; 1. We set the LISP-HEAP-GC-THRESHOLD to (0.5G minus used bytes) and call
; USE-LISP-HEAP-GC-THRESHOLD so that our next GC will occur when we've used a
; total of 0.5G.
;
; 2. We set the threshold back to *gc-min-threshold*= 0.125GB without calling
; USE-LISP-HEAP-GC-THRESHOLD.
;
; 3. Run a computation until we use up the 0.5G and the GC is called.  Say the
; GC reclaims 0.3GB so there's 0.2GB in use.  0.125GB more (the current
; LISP-HEAP-GC-THRESHOLD) is allocated so the ceiling is temporarily 0.325GB.
;
; 4. A post-GC hook runs which again sets the threshold to (0.5G minus used
; bytes), calls USE-LISP-HEAP-GC-THRESHOLD to raise the ceiling to 0.5G, then
; sets the threshold back to 0.125GB, and the process repeats.
;
; A subtlety about this scheme is that post-GC hooks runs in a separate
; thread from the main execution.  A possible bug is that in step 4,
; between checking the amount of memory in use and calling
; USE-LISP-HEAP-GC-THRESHOLD, more memory might be used up by the main
; execution, which would set the ceiling higher than we intended.  To
; prevent this, we initially interrupted the main thread to run step 4.
; However, discussions with Gary Byers led us to avoid calling
; process-interrupt, which seemed to be leading to errors.

; The following settings are highly heuristic.  We arrange that gc
; occurs at 1/8 of the physical memory size in bytes, in order to
; leave room for the gc point to grow (as per
; set-and-reset-gc-thresholds).  If we can determine the physical
; memory; great; otherwise we assume that it it contains at least 4GB,
; a reasonable assumption we think for anyone using ACL2 in 2015 or beyond.
