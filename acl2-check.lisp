; Essay on Fixnum Declarations

; To the best of our knowledge, the values of most-positive-fixnum in various
; 32-bit lisps are as follows, so we feel safe in using (signed-byte 30) and
; hence (unsigned-byte 29) to represent fixnums.  At worst, if a lisp is used
; for which (signed-byte 30) is not a subtype of fixnum, a compiler may simply
; fail to create efficient code.  Note:

; (the (signed-byte 30) 536870911) ; succeeds
; (the (signed-byte 30) 536870912) ; fails
; (the (unsigned-byte 29) 536870911) ; succeeds
; (the (unsigned-byte 29) 536870912) ; fails

; Values of most-positive-fixnum in 32-bit Lisps:
; AKCL, GCL: 2147483647
; Allegro:    536870911
; Lucid:      536870911
; CMUCL:      536870911
; SBCL:       536870911
; CCL:        536870911
; MCL:        268435455 ; not supported after ACL2 Version_3.1
; CLISP:       16777215
; Lispworks:  536870911 [version 6.0.1; but observed 8388607 in versions 4.2.0
;                        and 4.4.6]

; We have made many type declarations in the sources of (signed-byte 30).
; Performance could be seriously degraded if these were not fixnum
; declarations.  If the following check fails, then we should consider lowering
; 30.  However, clisp has 24-bit fixnums.  Clisp maintainer Sam Steingold has
; assured us that "CLISP has a very efficient bignum implementation."  Lispworks
; Version 4.2.0 on Linux, 32-bit, had most-positive-fixnum = 8388607 and
; most-negative-fixnum = -8388608; and we have been informed (email 10/22/02)
; that "this is an architectural limit on this platform and the LispWorks fixnum
; size cannot be reconfigured."  But Lispworks 6 is back to supporting larger
; fixnums.

; As of July 2018, 64-bit computers have been available for many years, and it
; may be appropriate soon to make changes based on that fact since ACL2 is only
; rarely run on 32-bit Lisps these days.  Below are values of the largest
; fixnums in 64-bit Lisps.

;                           ACL2 CHARACTERS
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; It is difficult or impossible to ensure that #\c is read in as the same
; character in different ACL2 sessions, for any ACL2 character c.  (Even
; #\Newline is potentially problematic, as its char-code is 10 in most Common
; Lisps but is 13 in [now-obsolete] MCL!)  Thus, the soundness of ACL2 rests on
; a caveat that all books are certified using the same Lisp image.  When we say
; ``same lisp image'' we don't mean the same exact process necessarily, but
; rather, an invocation of the same saved image.  Another reason for such a
; caveat, independent of the character-reading issue, is that different saved
; images may be tied into different compilers, thus making the object files of
; the books incompatible.

; Nevertheless, it would of course be nice if all host Lisp implementations of
; ACL2 actually do agree on character and string constants provided by the Lisp
; reader (based on *acl2-readtable*).  Our first check is intended to address
; this point, by providing some confidence that the host Lisp has an ASCII
; character set.  As explained above, we only intend soundness in the case that
; all books are certified from scratch using the same host Lisp, and we do not
; actually assume ASCII characters -- more precisely, we do not assume any
; particular values for code-char and code-char -- so this check is not really
; necessary, except for a claim about ASCII characters in "Precise Description
; of the ACL2 Logic", which should perhaps be removed.  However, as of January
; 2012 we seem to be able to make the following check in all supported Lisps,
; at least on our Linux and Mac OS platforms.  It should be sound for users to
; comment out this check, but with the understanding that ACL2 is taking
; whatever the Lisp reader (using *acl2-readtable*) gives it.

(let ((filename "acl2-characters"))

; Why do we read from a separate file, rather than just saving the relevant
; characters in the present file?  For example, it may seem reasonable to use a
; trusted host Lisp to obtain an alist by evaluating the following expression.

; (loop for i from 0 to 255 do (princ (cons i (code-char i))))

; Could the resulting the alist be placed into this file and used for the check
; below?

; We run into a problem right away with that approach because of Control-D.
; For example, try this

; (princ (cons 4 (code-char 4)))

; and then try quoting the output and reading it back in.  Or,
; try evaluating the following.

; (read-from-string (format nil "~a" (code-char 4)))

; We have seen an error in both cases.

; So instead, we originally generated the file acl2-characters as follows,
; using an ACL2 image based on CCL.

; (with-open-file (str "acl2-characters" :direction :output)
;                 (loop for i from 0 to 255
;                       do (write-char (code-char i) str)))

; We explicitly specify the :external-format in the case of host Lisps for
; which we set the character encoding after the build, on the command line
; written by save-acl2.

  (with-open-file
   (str filename :direction :input)
   (loop for i from 0 to 255

; The function legal-acl2-character-p, called in bad-lisp-objectp for
; characters and strings, checks that the char-code of any character that is
; read must be between 0 and 255.

         do (let ((temp (read-char str)))
              (when #-clisp (not (eql (char-code temp) i))

; In CLISP we find character 10 (Newline) at position 13 (expected Return).
; Perhaps this has something to do CLISP's attempt to comply with the CL
; HyperSpec Section 13.1.8, "Treatment of Newline during Input and Output".
; But something is amiss.  Consider for example the following log (with some
; output edited in the case of the first two forms, but no editing of output
; for the third form).

; ACL2 [RAW LISP]> (with-open-file (str "tmp" :direction :output)
;                                  (write-char (code-char 13) str))
; #\Return
; ACL2 [RAW LISP]> (with-open-file (str "tmp" :direction :input)
;                                  (equal (read-char str) (code-char 10)))
; T
; ACL2 [RAW LISP]> (format nil "~a" (code-char 13))

; So our check for CLISP is incomplete, but as explained in the comment just
; above this check, we can live with that.
