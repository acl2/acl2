; Our top-level function for generating variables attempts to feed
; genvar roots that generate names suggestive of the term being
; replaced by the variable.  We now develop the code for generating
; these roots.  It involves a recursive descent through a term.  At
; the bottom, we see variable symbols, e.g., ABC123, and we wish to
; generate the root '("ABC" . 124).

; For non-variable, non-quote terms we try first the idea of
; generating a name based on the type of the term.  The following
; constant associates with selected type sets the names of some
; variables that we find pleasing and suggestive of the type.  When we
; generalize a term we look at its type and if it is a subtype of one
; of those listed we prefer to use the variables given.  The first
; variable in each family is additionally used as the root for a
; gensym, should it come to that.  This list can be extended
; arbitrarily without affecting soundness, as long as (a) the car of
; each pair below is a type set and (b) the cdr is a true-list of
; symbols.  Arbitrary overlaps between the types and between the
; symbols are permitted.

;; Historical Comment from Ruben Gamboa:
;; I changed rational to real and complex-rational to complex in
;; the list below, since the new types are supersets of the old types,
;; so it should be harmless.

; the destructor terms.  For example, in (CONSP X) -> (CONS (CAR X)
; (CDR X)) = X, X is the crucial variable and puffing it up to (CONS A
; B) we can eliminate (CAR X) and (CDR X).  We store an elim-rule

; terms and has crucial-position j where (nth j '(v1 ... vn)) = rhs.

; candidate the term must not be a lambda application and the function
; symbol of the term must have an enabled destructor elimination rule.
; Furthermore, the crucial argument position of the term must be
; occupied by a variable symbol that is a member of the eliminables,
; that occurs only in equiv-hittable positions within the clause,
; and that occurs nowhere else in the arguments of the term, or else
; the crucial argument position must be occupied by a term that itself
; is recursively a candidate.  (Note that if the crucial argument is
; an eliminable term then when we eliminate it we will introduce a
; suitable distinct var into the crucial argument of this term and
; hence it will be eliminable.)  Finally, the instantiated hypotheses
; of the destructor elimination rule must not be known nil under the
; type-alist.

; Votes and nominations are accumulators.  Votes is a list of terms
; that contain term and will be candidates if term is eliminated.
; Nominations are explained below.

; If term is a candidate we either "nominate" it, by adding a
; "nomination" for term to the running accumulator nominations, or
; else we "second" a prior nomination for it.  A nomination of a term
; is a list of the form (dterm . votes) where dterm is the innermost
; eliminable candidate in term and votes is a list of all the terms
; that will be eliminable if dterm is eliminated.  To "second" a
; nomination is simply to add yourself as a vote.

; For example, if X is eliminable then (CAR (CAR (CAR X))) is a
; candidate.  If nominations is initially nil then at the conclusion
; of this function it will be

; (((CAR X) (CAR X) (CAR (CAR X)) (CAR (CAR (CAR X))))).

; We always return a nominations list.

; determine that every A in the clause is equal-hittable, except those
; A's occurring inside the (CAR A) and (CDR A) destructors.  Suppose
; the clause is p(A,(CAR A),(CDR A)).  The logical explanation of what
; elim does is to replace the A's not in the destructor nests by (CONS
; (CAR A) (CDR A)) and then generalize (CAR A) to HD and (CDR A) to
; TL.  This will produce p((CONS HD TL), HD, TL).  Observe that we do
; not actually hit the A's inside the CAR and CDR.  So we do not
; require that they be equiv-hittable.  (This situation actually
; arises in the elim rule for sets, where equiv tests equality on the

; generating n distinct new variable symbols.  So we just replace
; every destructor term by NIL.  This creates a ``pseudo-clause;'' the
; ``terms'' in it are not really legal -- NIL is not a variable
; symbol.  We only use this pseudo-clause to answer the question of
; whether the crucial variable, which certainly isn't NIL, is

; Warning: This function calls clausify using the sr-limit from the world, not
; from the rewrite-constant.  Do not call this function from the simplifier
; without thinking about passing in the sr-limit.

; Cl is a clause.  Terms is a list of terms and is in 1:1
; correspondence with vars, which is a list of vars.  Type-alist is
; the result of assuming false every literal of cl.  This function
; returns three results.  The first is a list of literals that can be
; disjoined to cl without altering the validity of cl.  The second is
; a subset of vars.  The third is an extension of ttree.  Technically
; speaking, this function may return any list of terms with the
; property that every term in it is false (under the assumptions in
; type-alist) and any subset of vars, provided the ttree returned is
; an extension of ttree and justifies the falsity of the terms
; returned.  The final ttree must be 'assumption-free and is if the
; initial ttree is also.

; As for motivation, we are about to generalize cl by replacing each
; term in terms by the corresponding var in vars.  It is sound, of
; course, to restrict the new variable to have whatever properties the
; corresponding term has.  This function is responsible for selecting
; the restrictions we want to place on each variable, based on
; type-set reasoning alone.  Thus, if t is known to have properties h1
; & ... & hk, then we can include (not h1), ..., (not hk) in our first
; answer to restrict the variable introduced for t.  We will include
; the corresponding var in our second answer to indicate that we have
; a type restriction on that variable.

; We do not want our type restrictions to cause the new clause to
; explode into cases.  Therefore, we adopt the following heuristic.
; We convert the type set of each term t into a term (hyp t) known to
; be true of t.  We negate (hyp t) and clausify the result.  If that
; produces a single clause (segment) then that segment is added to our
; answer.  Otherwise, we add no restriction.  There are probably
; better ways to do this than to call the full-blown
; convert-type-set-to-term and clausify.  But this is simple, elegant,
; and lets us take advantage of improvements to those two utilities.

(defun apply-instantiated-elim-rule (rule cl type-alist avoid-vars ens wrld)

; This function takes an instantiated elim-rule, rule, and applies it to a
; clause cl.  Avoid-vars is a list of variable names to avoid when we generate
; new ones.  See eliminate-destructors-clause for an explanation of that.

; An instantiated :ELIM rule has hyps, lhs, rhs, and destructor-terms, all
; instantiated so that the car of the destructor terms occurs somewhere in the
; clause.  To apply such an instantiated :ELIM rule to a clause we assume the
; hyps (adding their negations to cl), we generalize away the destructor terms
; occurring in the clause and in the lhs of the rule, and then we substitute
; that generalized lhs for the rhs into the generalized cl to obtain the final
; clause.  The generalization step above may involve adding additional
; hypotheses to the clause and using generalization rules in wrld.

; We return three things.  The first is the clause described above, which
; implies cl when the hyps of the rule are known to be true, the second is the
; set of elim variables we have just introduced into it, and the third is a
; list describing this application of the rune of the rule, as explained below.

; The list returned as the third value will become an element in the
; 'elim-sequence list in the ttree of the history entry for this elimination
; process.  The "elim-sequence element" we return has the form:

; (rune rhs lhs alist restricted-vars var-to-runes-alist ttree)

; and means "use rune to replace rhs by lhs, generalizing as specified by alist
; (which maps destructors to variables), restricting the restricted-vars
; variables by type (as justified by ttree) and restricting the
; var-to-runes-alist variables by the named generalize rules."  The ttree is
; 'assumption-free.

; Before Version_2.9.3, we just punted when contradictionp is true here, and
; this led to infinite loops reported by Sol Swords and then (shortly
; thereafter) Doug Harper, who both sent examples.  Our initial fix was to punt
; without going into the infinite loop, but then we implemented the current
; scheme in which we simply perform the elimination without generating clauses
; for the impossible "pathological" cases corresponding to falsity of each of
; the instantiated :elim rule's hypotheses.  Both fixes avoid the infinite loop
; in both examples.  We kept the present fix because at the time it actually
; proved the latter example (shown here) without induction:

; (include-book "ihs/@logops" :dir :system)
; (thm (implies (integerp (* 1/2 n)) (equal (mod n 2) 0)))

; However, the fix was buggy.  When we fixed those bugs after Version_3.6.1,
; the thm above no longer proved; but we still avoided the infinite loop.  That

; Cl is a clause we are trying to prove.  Eliminables is the set of variables
; on which we will permit a destructor elimination.  Avoid-vars is a list of
; variable names we are to avoid when generating new names.  In addition, we
; avoid the variables in cl.  We look for an eliminable destructor, select the
; highest scoring one and get its instantiated rule, split on the hyps of that
; rule to produce a "pathological" case of cl for each hyp and apply the rule
; to cl to produce the "normal" elim case.  Then we iterate until there is
; nothing more to eliminate.

; The handling of the eliminables needs explanation however.  At the top-level
; (when top-flg is t) eliminables is the set of all variables occurring in cl
; except those historically introduced by destructor elimination.  It is with
; respect to that set that we select our first elimination rule.  Thereafter
; (when top-flg is nil) the set of eliminables is always just the set of
; variables we have introduced into the clauses.  We permit these variables to
; be eliminated by this elim and this elim only.  For example, the top-level
; entry might permit elimination of (CAR X) and of (CAR Y).  Suppose we choose
; X, introducing A and B.  Then on the second iteration, we'll allow
; eliminations of A and B, but not of Y.

; We return three things.  The first is a set of clauses to prove instead of
; cl.  The second is the set of variable names introduced by this destructor
; elimination step.  The third is an "elim-sequence list" that documents this
; step.  If the list is nil, it means we did nothing.  Otherwise it is a list,
; in order, of the "elim-sequence elements" described in
; apply-instantiated-elim-rule above.  This list should become the
; 'elim-sequence entry in the ttree for this elim process.

; Historical Remark on Nqthm.

; This code is spiritually very similar to that of Nqthm.  However, it is much
; more elegant and easy to understand.  Nqthm managed the "iteration" with a
; "todo" list which grew and then shrank.  In addition, while we select the
; best rule on each round from scratch, Nqthm kept an ordered list of
; candidates (which it culled appropriately when eliminations removed some of
; them from the clause or when the crucial variables were no longer among
; eliminables).  Finally, and most obscurely, Nqthm used an inscrutable test on
; the "process history" (related to our elim-sequence) and a subtle invariant
; about the candidates to switch from our top-flg t mode to top-flg nil mode.
; We have spent about a week coding destructor elimination in ACL2 and we have
; thrown away more code that we have kept as we at first transcribed and then
; repeatedly refined the Nqthm code.  We are much happier with the current code
; than Nqthm's and believe it will be much easier to modify in the future.  Oh,
; one last remark: Nqthm's destructor elimination code had almost no comments
; and everything was done in a single big function with lots of ITERATEs.  It
; is no wonder it was so hard to decode.

; Our first step is to get the type-alist of cl.  It is used in two different
; ways: to identify contradictory hypotheses of candidate :ELIM lemmas and to
; generate names for new variables.

; If the flag is t, it returns all of the variables introduced into
; the history by the given process.  If the flag is nil, it returns
; all of the variables introduced into the history by any other
; process.  Note: the variables returned may not even occur in the
; clause whose history we scan.

; For example, if the only two processes that introduce variables are
; destructor elimination and generalization, then when given
; 'eliminate-destructors-clause and mine-flg nil this function will
; return all the variables introduced by 'generalize-clause.

; In order to work properly, a process that introduces variables must
; so record it by adding a tagged object to the ttree of the process.
; The tag should be 'variables and the object should be a list of the
; variables introduced at that step.  There should be at most one
; occurrence of that tag in the ttree.

; Why are we interested in this concept?  Destructor elimination is
; controlled by a heuristic meant to prevent indefinite elim loops
; involving simplification.  For example, suppose you eliminate (CDR
; X0) by introducing (CONS A X1) for X0, and then open a recursive
; function so as to produce (CDR X1).  It is easy to cause a loop if
; you then eliminate (CDR X1) by replacing X1 it with (CONS B X2),
; etc.  To prevent this, we do not allow destructor elimination to
; work on a variable that was introduced by destructor elimination
; (except within the activation of the elim process that introduces
; that variable).

; That raises the question of telling how a variable was introduced
; into a clause.  In ACL2 we adopt the convention described above and
; follow the rule that no process shall introduce a variable into a
; clause that has been introduced by a different process in the
; history of that clause.  Thus, if X1 is introduced by elim into the
; history, then X1 cannot also be introduced by generalization, even
; if X1 is new for the clause when generalization occurs.  By
; following this rule we know that if a variable is in a clause and
; that variable was introduced into the history of the clause by elim
; then that variable was introduced into the clause by elim.  If
; generalize could "re-use" a variable that was already "owned" by
; elim in the history, then we could not accurately determine by
; syntactic means the elim variables in the clause.

; Historical Remark on Nqthm:

; Nqthm solved this problem by allocating a fixed set of variable names
; to elim and a disjoint set to generalize.  At the top of the waterfall it
; removed from those two fixed sets the variables that occurred in the
; input clause.  Thereafter, if a variable was found to be in the (locally)
; fixed sets, it was known to be introduced by the given process.  The
; limitation to a fixed set caused the famous set-diff-n error message
; when the set was exhausted:

;    FATAL ERROR:  SET-DIFF-N called with inappropriate arguments.

; In the never-released xnqthm -- the "book version" of Nqthm that was
; in preparation when we began work on ACL2 -- we generated a more
; informative error message and increased the size of the fixed sets
; from 18 to over 600.  But that meant copying a list of length 600 at
; the top of the waterfall.  But the real impetus to the current
; scheme was the irritation over there being a fixed set and the
; attraction of being able to generate mnemonic names from terms.  (It
; remains to be seen whether we like the current algorithms.  E.g., is
; AENI really a good name for (EXPLODE-NONNEGATIVE-INTEGER N 10 A)?
; In any case, now we are free to experiment with name generation.)

; rhs2) and do it in a cross-fertilize sort of way (left for right
; into right or right for left into left); otherwise we substitute for
; all occurrences.  Delete-lit-flg is t if we are to delete the first

; First, we substitute into lit2 as appropriate.  We obtain new-lit2
; and a ttree.  We ignore the hitp result always returned by
; subst-equiv-expr.

; What do we mean by "as appropriate"?  We consider three cases on
; lit2, the literal into which we are substituting: lit2 is (equiv lhs
; rhs), lit2 is (not (equiv lhs rhs)), or otherwise.  We also consider
; whether we are cross fertilizing or just substituting for all

; Caution: There was once a bug below.  We are cross fertilizing.
; Suppose we see (equiv lhs2 rhs2) and want to substitute lhs1 for
; rhs1 in rhs2.  What geneqv do we maintain?  The bug, which was
; completely nonsensical, was that we maintained *geneqv-iff*, just as
; above.  But in fact we must maintain whatever geneqv maintains
; *geneqv-iff* in the second arg of equiv.  Geneqv-lst returns a list
; of geneqvs, one for each argument position of equiv.  We select the
; one in the argument position corresponding to the side we are
; changing.  Actually, the two geneqvs for an equivalence relation
; ought to be the identical, but it would be confusing to exploit
; that.

; In the days when this bug was present there was another problem!  We
; only substituted into (equal lhs2 rhs2)!  (That is, the case-match
; below was on ('equal lhs2 rhs2) rather than (equiv-sym lhs2 rhs2).)
; So here is an example of a screwy substitution we might have done:
; Suppose (equiv a b) is a hypothesis and (equal (f a) (f b)) is a
; conclusion and that we are to do a cross-fertilization of a for b.
; We ought not to substitute into equal except maintaining equality.
; But we actually would substitute into (f b) maintaining iff!  Now
; suppose we knew that (equiv x y) -> (iff (f x) (f y)).  Then we
; could derive (equal (f a) (f a)), which would be t and unsound.  The
; preconditions for this screwy situation are exhibited by:

;  (defun squash (x)
;    (cond ((null x) nil)
;          ((integerp x) 1)
;          (t t)))
;
;  (defun equiv (x y)
;    (equal (squash x) (squash y)))
;
;  (defequiv equiv)
;
;  (defun f (x) x)
;
;  (defcong equiv iff (f x) 1)
;

; In particular, (implies (equiv a b) (equal (f a) (f b))) is not a
; theorem (a=1 and b=2 are counterexamples), but this function, if
; called with that input clause, ((not (equiv a b)) (equal (f a) (f
; b))), and the obvious lit1, etc., would return (equal (f a) (f a)),
; which is T.  (Here we are substituting left for right, a for b.)  So
; there was a soundness bug in the old version of this function.

; But it turns out that this bug could never be exploited.  The bug
; can be provoked only if we are doing cross-fertilization.  And
; cross-fertilization is only done if the fertilization is "feasible".
; That means that every occurrence of b in the clause is equiv
; hittable, as per every-occurrence-equiv-hittablep-in-clausep.  In
; our example, the b in (f b) is not equiv hittable.  Indeed, if every
; occurrence of b is equiv hittable then no matter what braindamaged
; geneqv we use below, the result will be sound!  A braindamaged
; geneqv might prevent us from hitting some, but any hit it allowed is
; ok.

; This bug was first noticed by Bill McCune (September, 1998), who
; reported an example in which the system io indicated that a was
; substituted for b but in fact no substitution occurred.  No
; substitution occurred because we didn't have the congruence theorem
; shown above -- not a surprising lack considering the random nature
; of the problem.  At first I was worried about soundness but then saw
; the argument above.
