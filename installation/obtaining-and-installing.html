ACL2 is more than just the executable image.  In particular, it comes
with
a <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v8-0/index.html#User's-Manual">user's
manual</a>, and the system is distributed with libraries developed by
the ACL2 community, the
<i><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/current/combined-manual/?topic=ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS">community
  books</a></i>.  Start here and we will take you through the whole
  process of obtaining and installing ACL2.

<p>

First, create a directory under which to store ACL2 Version 8.0.  We will
call this directory <I>dir</I>.  For example, <I>dir</I> might be
<CODE>/home/jones/acl2/</CODE>.

<H3>NOTE: If you intend to obtain an incremental release (e.g. 2.9.4 as opposed
to 2.9), please see the <a href="../new.html">ACL2 News</a> for instructions.
Otherwise, continue reading here.</H3>

<p>

The <a href="http://acl2s.ccs.neu.edu/acl2s/doc/">ACL2 Sedan</a>
(ACL2s) is an Eclipse-based IDE for ACL2 that is distributed with pre-certified
books and pre-built binaries.  If you
  use an alternative development environment (such as Emacs), you
can still <a href="http://acl2s.ccs.neu.edu/acl2s/src/acl2/">fetch a
tarball</a> for your x86-based Linux/Mac/Windows system that contains a
pre-built binary of (pure) ACL2, using the following instructions
based on information kindly provided by Harsh Raju Chamarthi.
Just extract the
appropriate tarball (using <code>tar xfz</code> on Linux or Mac
and <code>unzip</code> on Windows)
under a path with <i>no</i> spaces.
Then run the script you will
find, <code>run_acl2</code> on Linux or Mac
and <code>run_acl2.exe</code> on Windows, to start an ACL2 session.
(Note that The first time you execute that command,
the certificate (<code>.cert</code>) files are automatically
fixed, according to the full pathname of your <code>books/</code> directory.)
Also see
the <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v8-0/combined-manual/index.html?topic=ACL2____ACL2-SEDAN">ACL2
documentation topic on the ACL2 Sedan</a>.


<LI><B><A NAME="Shortcut-windows">Windows</A></B>

<p>

In the past, a Windows Installer for ACL2 has included a Unix
environment, pre-certified standard and workshop books, and a copy of
Gnu Emacs.  This capability has largely been superseded
by <a href="#Build-Particular">the section on Building an Executable
Image on Some Particular Systems</a> and
the Shortcut using the ACL2 Sedan, <a href="#Shortcut-acl2s">above</a>.
See also <a href="../../distrib/windows/">information about ACL2 on
Windows</a>.

<LI><B><A NAME="Shortcut-MacPorts">MacPorts for Mac OS X</A></B>

<p>

ACL2 versions are sometimes been made available under MacPorts.  We
have been informed that ACL2 Version 8.0 can be installed on MacOS via
MacPorts.

<LI><B><A NAME="Shortcut-debian">Debian GNU Linux</A></B>

<p>

A Debian Gnu Linux package is available, which is likely to work on
other Linux systems as well.  Thanks to Camm Maguire for maintaining
this package, and for pointing out that as Debian packages are simply
ar and tar archives, they can be unpacked on any linux system, and who
has said: "If someone is running Debian, all they want to do is
'apt-get install acl2', doing likewise for any optional add-on package
they wish as well, e.g. emacs, infix, etc."  Alternatively, Debian GNU
Linux users may wish
to <A HREF="http://packages.qa.debian.org/a/acl2.html">download the
ACL2 Debian package for Linux</A>.  An alternate location you might
want to check
is <code><a href="http://backports.debian.org">backports.debian.org</a></code>.

<H2><A NAME="Sources">Obtaining the Sources and Community Books</A></H2>

Here is how to obtain the sources and community books and place them
in a directory, <I>dir</I>.

<p>

(First, a note for Windows users only: we suggest that you obtain a
Unix-like environment or, at least, download a utility such as
<code>djtarnt.exe</code> to use with the <code>-x</code> option on
gzipped tarfiles.  WARNING: At least one user experienced CR/LF issues
when using WinZIP, but we have received the suggestion that people
untarring with that utility should probably turn off smart cr/lf
conversion.)

<UL>

<LI>Save <A HREF="https://github.com/acl2-devel/acl2-devel/releases/download/8.0/acl2-8.0.tar.gz">
    acl2-8.0.tar.gz</A> on directory <I>dir</I>.
  </LI>
<BR>

<LI>Execute the following four Unix commands to obtain the ACL2 system
and community books.  (<b>Note</b>: Gnu tar is preferred, as there
have been some problems with long file names when using tar provided
by SunOS.  You may want to use the -i option, "<code>tar xpvfi
8.0.tar</code>", if you have problems with other than Gnu tar.  You
can see if you have Gnu tar by running "<code>tar -v</code>".)  The
resulting tarball and its extracted directory will consist of
less than 80 MB and 240 MB, respectively.  Additional space is
required to build an executable image, perhaps a bit more than 200 MB
depending on the platform (including the host Lisp); and more will be
required to <A HREF="using.html#Certifying">certify books</A>.


<BR><BR>
<CODE>cd <I>dir</I></CODE><BR>
<CODE>tar xfz acl2-8.0.tar.gz</CODE><BR>
<CODE>rm acl2-8.0.tar.gz</CODE><BR>
<CODE>cd acl2-8.0</CODE><BR>
<BR>
</LI>

</UL>

<p>

<b>Note</b>: You can also fetch the latest "bleeding-edge" version of
the ACL2 system and the community books using git, as shown below.
(These generally work very well, but the authors of ACL2 issue this
disclaimer at startup: <i>The authors of ACL2 consider such
distributions to be experimental; they may be incomplete, fragile, and
unable to pass our own regression tests.</i>)

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/acl2/acl2

Moreover, you
can <a href="https://github.com/acl2/acl2#contributors-wanted">contribute
books by joining the GitHub project</a>.

<BR><HR noshade size=8><BR>
<H2><A NAME="Create-Image">Creating or Obtaining an Executable Image</A></H2>

The next step is to create an executable image.  The common approach is to
build that image from the sources you have already obtained.
<!-- The following is only for non-incremental releases. -->
However, you may
be able to <A HREF="#Pre-Built-Images">take a short cut by downloading an
ACL2 image</A>, in which case you can skip ahead to the page on
<A HREF="using.html">Using ACL2</A>.  Otherwise you should click on
one of the links just below.
<!-- End of only for non-incremental releases. -->
Choose the last option if you are using a Common Lisp on which you cannot save
an image (e.g., a trial version of Allegro Common Lisp).

<P>
PLEASE NOTE: The available memory for ACL2 is determined by the underlying
Common Lisp executable.  If you need more memory, refer to your Common Lisp's
instructions for building an executable.

was created using <code>md5sum</code>.  We may add additional

We assume you have obtained ACL2 and placed it in directory <I>dir</I>, as
described <A HREF="#Sources">above</A>.
<!-- The following is only for non-incremental releases. -->
If you downloaded a <A
HREF="#Pre-Built-Images">pre-built ACL2 image</A>, you may skip this section.
<!-- End of only for non-incremental releases. -->
Connect to <I>dir</I> as above and execute <BR><BR> <CODE>cd
acl2-8.0</CODE><BR> <CODE>make LISP=</CODE><I>xxx</I><BR>
<BR>
where <I>xxx</I> is the command to run your local Common Lisp.
<P>
By default, if no <CODE>LISP=</CODE><I>xxx</I> is specified,
<CODE>LISP=ccl</CODE> is used.  On our hosts, <CODE>ccl</CODE> is the name of
Clozure Common Lisp (CCL), which can be obtained as <a
href="requirements.html#Obtaining-CCL">explained in the Requirements document</a>.

<P>

This will create executable <code>saved_acl2</code> in the
<code>acl2-8.0</code> directory.

<P>

The time taken to carry out this process depends on the host processor
but may be only a few minutes for a fast processor.  The size of the
resulting binary image is dependent on which Lisp was used, but it may be
a couple hundred megabytes or so.

<P>
This <CODE>make</CODE> works for the Common Lisp implementations listed
in <A HREF="requirements.html">Requirements document</A> on systems we
have tested.  See the file <CODE>acl2-8.0/GNUmakefile</CODE> for
further details.  If this <CODE>make</CODE> command does not work for
you, please see the instructions below for <A HREF="#Non-Unix">other

<H3><A NAME="Non-Unix">Building an Executable Image on Other than a

Next we describe how to create a binary image containing ACL2 without
using the `<code>make</code>' utility.  If you are using a <B>trial
version</B> of Allegro Common Lisp, then you may not be able to save
an image.  In that case, skip to <A href="#Running">Running Without
Building an Executable Image</A>.

<P>

See also <a href="#Build-Particular">Building an Executable Image on Some Particular
Systems</a>, in case you want to skip directly to the instructions in one of
its subtopics.

<P>

Otherwise, proceed as follows.

<P>

Your Common Lisp should be one of those listed in
<A HREF="requirements.html">Requirements document</A>.  Filenames
below should default to the <I>dir</I><CODE>/acl2-8.0</CODE>
directory; please connect to that directory before continuing.

<OL>
<P><LI> Remove file <CODE>nsaved_acl2</CODE> if it exists.</LI>

<P><LI> Start up Common Lisp in the <CODE>acl2-8.0</CODE> directory
and submit the following sequence of commands.

<PRE>
  ; Compile
  (load "init.lisp")
  (in-package "ACL2")
  (compile-acl2)
</PRE>

  The commands above will compile the ACL2 sources and create compiled object
  files on your <CODE>acl2-8.0</CODE> subdirectory.  Here we assume
  that executables have extension <code>.dxl</code>, but this will
  depend on your host Lisp and operating system.
</LI>

<P><LI> Now exit your Common Lisp and invoke a fresh copy of it (mainly to avoid
  saving an image with the garbage created by the compilation process). Again
  arrange to connect to the <CODE>acl2-8.0</CODE> subdirectory. In the
  fresh Lisp <a name="initialization-first-pass">type</a>:

<PRE>
  ; Initialization, first pass
  (load "init.lisp")
  (in-package "ACL2")
  (load-acl2)
  (initialize-acl2)
</PRE>

  This will load the new object files in the Lisp image and bootstrap ACL2 by
  reading and processing the source files. But the attempt at initialization
  will end in an error saying that it is impossible to finish because a certain
  file was compiled during the processing, thus dirtying the image yet again.
  (If however the attempt ends with an error during compilation of file
  <code>TMP1.lisp</code>, see the first troubleshooting tip <a
  href="#troubleshooting-TMP1">below</a>.)
</LI>

<P><LI> So now exit your Common Lisp and invoke a fresh copy of it (again arranging
  to connect to your <CODE>acl2-8.0</CODE> subdirectory). Then, in the
  fresh Lisp type:

<PRE>
  ; Initialization, second pass
  (load "init.lisp")
  (in-package "ACL2")
  (save-acl2 (quote (initialize-acl2))
             "saved_acl2")
</PRE>

  You have now saved an image.  Exit Lisp now.  Subsequent steps will put the
  image in the right place.

<P><LI> Remove <CODE>osaved_acl2</CODE> if it exists.

<P><LI> <b>IF</b> <CODE>saved_acl2</CODE> and <CODE>saved_acl2.dxl</CODE> both exist <b>THEN</b>:
<ul>
     <li>move <CODE>saved_acl2.dxl</CODE> to <CODE>osaved_acl2.dxl</CODE></li>
     <li>move <CODE>saved_acl2</CODE> to <CODE>osaved_acl2</CODE>
         and edit <CODE>osaved_acl2</CODE>, changing <CODE>saved_acl2.dxl</CODE>
         (at end of line) to <CODE>osaved_acl2.dxl</CODE></li>
</ul>
     <b>ELSE IF</b> <CODE>saved_acl2</CODE> exists <b>THEN</b>:
<ul>
     <li>move <CODE>saved_acl2</CODE> to <CODE>osaved_acl2</CODE></li>
</ul>
</LI>

<P><LI> Move <CODE>nsaved_acl2</CODE> to <CODE>saved_acl2</CODE>.</LI>

<P><LI> For some Common Lisps, a
     file <CODE>nsaved_acl2.</CODE><em>suffix</em> is created for some
     <em>suffix</em>.
     Move it to: <CODE>saved_acl2.</CODE><em>suffix</em></LI>

<P><LI> Make sure <CODE>saved_acl2</CODE> is executable.  For Windows
this involves two mini-steps:

<blockquote>

(a) Remove the <code>"$*"</code> from the <code>saved_acl2</code>
script (because Windows does not understand <code>$*</code>).
Consequently, any arguments you pass to ACL2 via the command line will
be ignored.

<p>

(b) Rename <code>saved_acl2</code> to <code>saved_acl2.bat</code>, for
example by executing the following command.<br><br>
<code>rename saved_acl2 saved_acl2.bat</code>

<p>

Otherwise here are steps to follow.  (These are quite old and may have
bugs.  Please report any bugs to
the <A HREF="mailto:kaufmann@cs.utexas.edu">Matt Kaufmann</A>ACL2
implementors</A>.)

<ol>
<li><b>FIRST</b> get GCL running on your Windows system using <b>ONE</b> of the
following two options.  Note that GCL can be unhappy with spaces in filenames,
so you should probably save the GCL distribution to a directory whose path is
free of spaces.

<ul>
<li><b>OR</b>, obtain GCL for Windows systems from <code><a
href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcl/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcl/</a></code>
or as explained <a href="#Obtaining-GCL">above</a>.  You
may wish to pick a <code>.zip</code> file from the <code>cvs/</code>
subdirectory (containing pre-releases) that has "<code>mingw32</code>" in the
name.

<li><b>OR ELSE</b>, perhaps you can build GCL on your Windows system from the
sources.  The mingw tools and the cygnus bash shell have been used to build
distributed GCL executables.

</ul>

<li><b>SECOND</b>, create an appropriate GCL batch file.  When we tried running
the script <code>gclm/bin/gclm.bat</code> that came with
<code>gcl-cvs-20021014-mingw32</code> from the above ftp site, a separate
window popped up, and with an error.  Many ACL2 users prefer running in an
emacs shell buffer.  (We obtained emacs for Windows from <code><a
href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/windows/emacs/21.2/emacs-21.2-fullbin-i386.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/windows/emacs/21.2/emacs-21.2-fullbin-i386.tar.gz</a></code>.)
The following modification of <code>gclm.bat</code> seemed to solve the problem
(your pathnames may vary).
<pre>
@
% do not delete this line %
@ECHO off
set cwd=%cd%
path C:\gcl\gclm\mingw\bin;%PATH%
C:\gcl\gclm\lib\gcl-2.6.2\unixport\saved_gcl.exe -dir C:/gcl/gclm/lib/gcl-2.6.2/unixport/ -libdir  C:/gcl/gclm/lib/gcl-2.6.2/ -eval "(setq si::*allow-gzipped-file* t)" %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
</pre>

<li><b>THIRD</b>, follow the <A HREF="#Non-Unix">instructions for
    other than Unix-like systems</A> above, though the resulting file
    may be called
<code>saved_acl2.exe</code> rather than <code>saved_acl2</code>.

<!-- NOTE to developers: v8-0 below indicates a normal release, which is OK. -->
<!-- Do not edit that for incremental releases. -->

<li><b>FINALLY</b>, create a file <code>acl2.bat</code> as explained in
<code><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v8-0/distrib/images/Readme.html#acl2-bat">
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v8-0/distrib/images/Readme.html</a></code>.

</ol>

<p>

We hope that the above simply works.  If you experience
problems, the following hints may help.

<p>

<b>TROUBLESHOOTING:</b>
<ul>

<li><a name="troubleshooting-TMP1">We</a> tried building ACL2 on Windows XP on
top of GCL, our attempt broke at the end of the "<a
href="#initialization-first-pass">Initialization, first pass</a>" step, while
compiling <code>TMP1.lisp</code>.  That was easily remedied by starting up a
fresh GCL session and invoking <code>(compile-file "TMP1.lisp")</code> before
proceeding to the next step.

<li>Yishai Feldman has provided some nice instructions at <code><a
href="http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/yishai/reasoning/win-install.htm">http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/yishai/reasoning/win-install.htm</a></code>,
some of which we have tried to incorporate here.  A useful point made there is
that when you want to quit ACL2, use <code>:good-bye</code> (or
<code>(good-bye)</code> which works even in raw Lisp).  Or you can use
<code>(user::bye)</code> in raw Lisp.  The point is:  Avoid <code>control-c
control-d</code>, even thought that often works fine in emacs under
Unix-like systems.

<li>If the above batch file does not work for some reason, an alternate
approach may be to set environment variables.  You may be able to add to the
<code>PATH</code> variable <i>gcl-dir</i><code>\gcc\bin</code>, where
<i>gcl-dir</i> is the directory where GCL is installed.  To get to the place to
set environment variables, you might be able to go to the control panel, under
system, under advanced.  Alternately, you might be able to get there by opening
<code>My Computer</code> and right-clicking to get to <code>Properties</code>,
then selecting the <code>Advanced</code> tab.  At one time, when GCL/Windows
was release as Maxima, Pete Manolios suggested adding the system variable
LD_LIBRARY_PATH with the value "maxima-dir\gcc\i386-mingw32msvc\include"; this
may or may not be necessary for your GCL installation (and the path would of
course likely be different).

</ul>

<BR><HR noshade size=8><BR>

<H2><A NAME="Running">Running Without Building an Executable Image</A></H2>

The most convenient way to use ACL2 is first to install an executable image as
described above for <A HREF="#Other-Unix">Unix-like systems</A> and <A
HREF="#Non-Unix">other</A> platforms.  However, in some cases this is not
possible, for example if you are using a trial version of Allegro Common Lisp.
In that case you should follow the steps below each time you want to start up
ACL2.

<P>

We assume you have obtained ACL2 and placed it in directory <I>dir</I>, as
described above for <A HREF="#Sources">Unix-like systems</A> or <A
HREF="#Sources-Non-Unix">other</A> platforms.
<!-- The following is only for non-incremental releases. -->
(If you downloaded a <A
HREF="#Pre-Built-Images">pre-built ACL2 image</A>, then you may skip this section.)
<!-- End of only for non-incremental releases. -->
Connect to subdirectory <CODE>acl2-8.0</CODE> of <I>dir</I>,
start up your Common Lisp, and compile by executing the following forms.
<I>This sequence of steps need only be performed once.</I>

<PRE>
  (load "init.lisp")
  (in-package "ACL2")
  (compile-acl2)
</PRE>

Now each time you want to use ACL2, you need only execute the following forms
after starting up Common Lisp in subdirectory <CODE>acl2-8.0</CODE> of
<I>dir</I>.

<PRE>
  (load "init.lisp")
  (in-package "ACL2")
  (load-acl2)
  (initialize-acl2)
</PRE>

<I>Note.</I> The resulting process includes the ACL2 documentation, and hence
will probably be considerably larger (perhaps twice the size) than the result
of running an executable image created as described <A
HREF="#Create-Image">above</A>.

We strongly recommend that ACL2 users update their local copies of the
system and community books at each ACL2 release.  While that should
suffice for many ACL2 users, nevertheless for those who prefer to
obtain the latest developments, the ACL2 source code and community
books have been made available between ACL2 releases, by way of
revision control using git.
<i>The authors of ACL2 consider git distributions to be experimental;
while they will likely be fully functional in most cases, they could
however be incomplete, fragile, and unable to pass our own
regression.</i>  See
the <a href="https://github.com/acl2/acl2">project website</a> for
more information.
