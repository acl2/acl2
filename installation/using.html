Here we begin with a discussion of how to <A HREF="#Invoking">invoke ACL2</A>
interactively.  We then discuss <A HREF="#Testing">testing</A> as well as the
<A HREF="#Certifying">certification</A> of
ACL2 <i><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v7-1/combined-manual/?topic=ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS">community
books</a></i>.  We conclude with a discussion of
the <A HREF="#Documentation">documentation</A>.

<H3><A NAME="Invoking">Invoking ACL2</A></H3>

We assume that you have followed the installation instructions to
install, under some directory <I>dir</I>, a subdirectory <code>acl2-7.1</code>.
The sources and perhaps an executable image are located on that subdirectory.
However, if you have not saved an image but instead use the directions
for <A HREF="obtaining-and-installing.html#Running">Running Without Building an Executable Image</A>, skip
to <A HREF="#Starting">When ACL2 Starts Up</A> below.

<P>

The executable image is called <code>acl2-7.1/saved_acl2</code>.  You can
invoke ACL2 by running that image, e.g.,

<BR><BR>
<CODE>mycomputer% </CODE><I>dir</I><CODE>/acl2-7.1/saved_acl2</CODE>
<BR><BR>

If you on a Unix-like system, then to make it easy to invoke ACL2 by
typing a short command, e.g.,

<BR><BR>
<CODE>mycomputer% acl2</CODE>
<BR><BR>

you may want to install an executable file on your path, e.g.,
<code>/usr/local/bin/acl2</code>, containing the following two lines:

<BR><BR>
<CODE>#!/bin/csh -f</CODE><BR>
<I>dir</I><CODE>/acl2-7.1/saved_acl2</CODE><BR>
<BR><BR>

Note: A carriage return in the file after the last line above may be important!
<P>

<BR>
<H4><A NAME="Starting">When ACL2 Starts Up</A></H4>

When you invoke ACL2, you should see the host Common Lisp 
print a header concerning the ACL2 version, license and copyright.
<P>
Most or all hosts then automatically enter the ACL2 ``command loop,'' an ACL2
read-eval-print loop with the prompt:
<PRE>
ACL2 !>
</PRE>
If however a host leaves you in Common Lisp's read-eval-print loop,
then you'll need to evaluate the Common Lisp expression
<CODE>(ACL2::LP)</CODE> or simply <CODE>(LP)</CODE> if the current
package is <CODE>"ACL2"</CODE>.
<P>
Once in the ACL2 command loop, you can type an ACL2 term, typically
followed by ``return'' or ``enter,'' and ACL2 will evaluate the term,
print its value, and prompt you for another one.  Below are three
simple interactions:
<PRE>
ACL2 !>t
T
ACL2 !>'abc
ABC
ACL2 !>(+ 2 2)
4
</PRE>
<P>

To get out of the ACL2 command loop, type the <code>:q</code> command.
This returns you to the host Common Lisp.  We sometimes call this
``raw Lisp.''  You may re-enter the command loop with
<code>(LP)</code> as above.

<P>
Note that when you are in raw Lisp you can overwrite or destroy ACL2
by executing inappropriate Common Lisp expressions.  <B>All bets are
off once you've exited our loop.</B> That said, many users do it.
For example, you might exit our loop, activate some debugging or trace
features in raw Lisp, and then reenter our loop.  While developing
proofs or tracking down problems, this is reasonable behavior.

<P>
Now you are ready to <A HREF="#Testing">test</A> your image.

<BR><HR>
<H3><A NAME="Testing">Testing ACL2</A></H3>

<P>
An easy way to test the theorem prover is to
type the following term to the ACL2 command loop:
<PRE>
:mini-proveall
</PRE>
This will cause a moderately long sequence of commands to be processed, each of
which is first printed out as though you had typed it.  Each will print some
text, generally a proof of some conjecture.  None should fail.

<P>
A more elaborate test is to <A NAME="#Certifying">certify
    the <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v7-1/combined-manual/?topic=ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS">community
books</a>, which is a good idea anyhow; this is our next
    topic.  On a Unix-like system, you can also certify just a
    small but useful subset of the books in a few minutes by
    executing, in directory
<i>dir</i>/<code>acl2-7.1</code>:
<pre>
make certify-books-short
</pre>

<BR><HR>
<H3><A NAME="Certifying">Certifying ACL2 Books</A></H3>

The <i><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v7-1/combined-manual/?topic=ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS">community
books</a></i>, which reside in subdirectory <code>books/</code>, have
been contributed mainly by users.  The general topic of books is
discussed thoroughly in the ACL2
<A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v7-1/combined-manual/index.html?topic=ACL2____BOOKS">books
documentation</A>.

<P>
Books should be ``certified'' before they are used.  We do not distribute
certificates with our books, mainly because certification produces compiled
code specific to the host.  You should certify the books locally, both as a test of
your ACL2 image and because books generally need to be certified before they
can be used.

<P>
It is easy to re-certify all the community books on a Unix-like system.
We recommend you do this.  If you have entered ACL2, exit to the
operating system, e.g., evaluting the form, <code>(quit)</code>, or by
control-d in many systems.

<P>
While connected to <I>dir</I><CODE>/acl2-7.1</CODE>, execute
<PRE>
make certify-books
</PRE>

This will generate minimal output to the screen and will probably take an hour
or two.  Failure is indicated by the presence of <code>CERTIFICATION FAILED</code> in the log.

<P>

To remove the files thus created, invoke:
<PRE>
make clean-books
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>certify-books</CODE> target does not certify
the <code>workshops/</code> books, which include contributions
starting with the 1999 ACL2 workshop (described in teh
book <A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/publications/acl2-books/acs/index.html"><EM>Computer-Aided
Reasoning: ACL2 Case Studies</EM></A>) and include contributions from
all subsequent ACL2 workshops.  If you want to certify those books as
well, then instead (or in addition) use the <code>regression</code>
target:

<PRE>
make regression
</PRE>

Our main installation page contains
a <A HREF="installation.html#certify-books">discussion of options</A>
for the above command.

<P>
By default, certification uses the image
<I>dir</I><CODE>/acl2-7.1/saved_acl2</CODE>.  You may specify any ACL2
image, as long as it is either a command on your path or an absolute file
name, for example as follows.

<PRE>
make certify-books ACL2=my-acl2

make regression ACL2=/u/smith/projects/acl2/saved_acl2
</PRE>

<P>
We apologize to users of other than Unix-like systems (i.e., other
than Unix, GNU-Linux, and Mac OS X): we do not provide instructions
for recertifying all the community books on such systems, though
there are such environments that can be installed on Windows (e.g.,
Cygwin).  The certification methods provided by the authors of the
books vary greatly and we codified them in the makefile, which is
named <code>GNUmakefile</code>, used above.  Some subdirectories
of the community book (under <CODE>acl2-7.1/books/</CODE>) contain either a
<CODE>README</CODE> file or a <CODE>certify.lsp</CODE> file.  Users
who wish to certify one of these books and who cannot figure out (from
these scant clues) what to type to ACL2 should not hesitate to contact
the authors.

<P>
Next proceed to the section on <A HREF="#Documentation">Documentation</A>.

<BR><HR>
<H3><A NAME="Documentation">Documentation</A></H3>

Documentation is discussed in the section on
the <A HREF="../../home-page.html#User's-Manual">User's Manual</A> on
the ACL2 home page.

<BR><HR>
<H3><A NAME="Emacs">Emacs</A></H3>

Emacs users may find it helpful to load into emacs the file
</CODE><I>dir</I><CODE>/acl2-7.1/emacs/emacs-acl2.el</CODE>.
Utilities
offered by this file are documented near the top of the file.  In
particular, this file automatically loads the
<A HREF="../../manual/index.html?topic=ACL2____ACL2-DOC">ACL2-Doc
Emacs browser</A>.
