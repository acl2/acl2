ACL2 works on Unix, GNU-Linux, and Mac OS X, which we call "Unix-like
systems", as well as many Windows operating systems (at least
including Windows 98, Windows 2000, and Windows XP).  It can be built
on top of any of the following Common Lisps, listed here
alphabetically.

You may be able to obtain a trial version there.

<P><B><A NAME="Obtaining-CCL">Obtaining CCL (OpenMCL)</A></B><P>

Clozure Common Lisp (Clozure CL, or CCL) was formerly known as
OpenMCL.  Quoting from the <a href="http://ccl.clozure.com/">Clozure
Common Lisp web page</a> (July, 2014): ``Some distinguishing features
of the implementation include fast compilation speed, native threads,
a precise, generational, compacting garbage collector, and a
convenient foreign-function interface.''

<p>

Here is an easy way to obtain and build the latest version (generally
recommended) for Linux (or another OS; see below) running on an x86 or
x86-64.  First execute the following shell command to create
a <code>ccl</code> directory, but substituting
for <code>linuxx86</code>, if appropriate, any of
<code>darwinx86</code> (which we use for modern Macs), <code>freebsdx86</code>,
<code>solarisx86</code>, <code>windows</code>, <code>darwinppc</code>,
or <code>linuxppc</code>.

<pre>
svn co http://svn.clozure.com/publicsvn/openmcl/trunk/linuxx86/ccl
</pre>

Note: if however you insist on using the latest release, you can
obtain that instead, for example as follows (but replace "1.9" by the
latest version, for example as described
at <code>http://ccl.clozure.com/download.html</code>, and
replace <code>linuxx86</code> if appropriate as described above).

<pre>
svn co http://svn.clozure.com/publicsvn/openmcl/release/1.9/linuxx86/ccl
</pre>

Next rebuild the executable by issuing the following commands, but
replace "<code>./lx86cl64</code>" by a suitable executable; e.g., for
64-bit Darwin (on Mac OS) use "<code>./dx86cl64</code>".

<hr>
<pre>
./lx86cl64
(rebuild-ccl :full t)
(quit)
./lx86cl64
(rebuild-ccl :full t)
(quit)
</pre>
<hr>

<p>

Now your CCL executable is up to date.  Next, create a suitable
script, say as follows, where <code>DIR</code> is the full pathname
for the directory above the new <code>ccl</code> directory.

<hr>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh

tmp=`uname -a | fgrep x86_64`
export CCL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY=DIR/ccl
# Start up 64-bit or 32-bit lisp, respectively:
if [ "$tmp" != "" ] ; then \
    DIR/ccl/scripts/ccl64 $* ; \
else \
    DIR/ccl/scripts/ccl $* ; \
fi
</pre>
<hr>

Be sure to make your script executable.  For example, if your script
filename is <code>my-script</code> then on linux you might want to
execute the following shell command.

<pre>
chmod +x my-script
</pre>

Your script (invoked with a suitable pathname, or just the filename if
the directory is on your path) will now start the updated CCL lisp
image.

Step 3 in
<code><a
href="http://trac.clozure.com/openmcl/wiki/UpdatingFromSource">http://trac.clozure.com/openmcl/wiki/UpdatingFromSource</a></code>
has more details on building from source.
Alternatively, you can download a gzipped tar
file; see <a href="http://trac.clozure.com/openmcl">the main
Clozure CL page</a>.  (Note: Subversion and gzipped tar
files are great, but not so much a CCL disk image (<code>.dmg</code>
file), as we have had a report of the extracted CCL opening its own
window when you start it up.)  If you don't want to write your own
script (as suggested above) then after obtaining CCL, you may wish to
edit file <code>ccl/scripts/ccl</code> or file
<code>ccl/scripts/ccl64</code>, depending on whether you want to
use a 32-bit or 64-bit version (respectively).

CLISP is a non-commercial Common Lisp implementation, available from
<code><a href="http://clisp.cons.org/">http://clisp.cons.org/</a></code>.
We do not recommend CLISP as a platform for ACL2, for the following
reasons.

<ul>

<li>CLISP appears to run ACL2 much more slowly than the other supported
Common Lisp implementations.</li>

<li>Only minimal testing is done for ACL2 built on CLISP</li>

<li>CLISP does not currently support building ACL2(h).</li>

</ul>

CMU Common Lisp (sometimes called CMUCL) is a non-commercial Common Lisp
implementation, available from <code><a
href="http://www.cons.org/cmucl/">http://www.cons.org/cmucl/</a></code>.

<P><B><A NAME="Obtaining-GCL">Obtaining GCL</A></B><P>

You might be able
to <A HREF="http://packages.qa.debian.org/a/acl2.html">download a
binary Debian package for ACL2</A>.  Thanks to Camm Maguire for
maintaining this package.  Note however that it may take some time
after each ACL2 release for this binary Debian package to be updated
for that release.  Here is a shell command that might be used to
obtain that package (if running Debian).

<pre>
apt-get -q install gcl gcl-doc
</pre>

Otherwise, it should be easy to obtain and build GCL yourself.  There
are two recommended versions of GCL for building ACL2: GCL 2.6.8 and
GCL 2.6.10.  (GCL 2.6.9, which is <i>not</i> recommended, has some
issues that were fixed in GCL 2.6.10.)  GCL 2.6.8 appeared initially
to be faster for ACL2 regressions than GCL 2.6.10, but we recently
measured GCL 2.6.10 (actually GCL 2.6.10pre, as of Oct. 1, 2013) to be
slightly faster, using non-ANSI builds for both.  We have also had
better success with GCL 2.6.10 than GCL 2.6.8 on a Mac, where 2.6.8
ran out of memory for two regression tests but 2.6.10 (again, actually
2.6.10pre) did not.  Note that GCL 2.6.10 probably has better ANSI
support than 2.6.8, and ANSI support is needed if you choose to build
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v6-5/combined-manual/index.html?topic=ACL2____HONS-AND-MEMOIZATION">ACL2(h)</a>).

<p>

You can fetch either GCL 2.6.8 and GCL 2.6.10 as a tarball from the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcl/">main GNU website for
  GCL</a>.  From GCL source you can build an executable by extracting
  from the tarball, standing in the resulting <code>gcl/</code>
  directory, and issuing one of the following commands.

<pre>
# Recommended for 64-bit Linux:
./configure --enable-maxpage=1048576 && make

# Recommended for Mac OS:
./configure && make

# If you want an ANSI build
# (but add "--enable-maxpage=1048576" in the case of 64-bit Linux, as above):
./configure --enable-ansi && make
</pre>

<!-- I don't know that we need this comment any longer, since we write
    a suitable --dynamic-space-size argument to saved_acl2 scripts.
Note for 32-bit linux users: When building ACL2 with SBCL 1.0.18 and
1.0.39 on 32-bit Linux, we ran out of memory with the SBCL message
"Heap exhausted, game over."  We solved the problem by modifying our
sbcl script to use <code>--dynamic-space-size 2000</code>, for example:

<hr>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
export SBCL_HOME=/projects/acl2/lisps/sbcl/sbcl-1.0.39-x86-linux/output
/projects/acl2/lisps/sbcl/sbcl-1.0.39-x86-linux/src/runtime/sbcl --dynamic-space-size 2000 $*
</pre>
<hr>

Your results may vary; one user has reported solving the problem with
<code>--dynamic-space-size 2000000000</code>.
