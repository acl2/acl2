<HEAD><TITLE>ACL2 Version 8.1 Installation Guide: Installing CCL</TITLE></HEAD>

<BODY TEXT="#000000" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" STYLE="font-family:'Verdana'">

<p>These self-contained instructions show how to install Clozure CL on
  Linux.  They might be a bit more convenient for ACL2 users than
  those on
  the <a href="https://ccl.clozure.com/install.html">"Installing
  Clozure CL"</a> page.  A table on that page shows how to make small
  changes in the names below if your platform is other than Linxu,
  e.g., Mac OS X (Darwin).</p>

<pre>
# Obtain a ccl distribution in a fresh directory:
git clone https://github.com/Clozure/ccl
# Rename that directory as suggested below, after
# executing the following three commands.
cd ccl
git rev-parse HEAD
cd ../../
# Change directory name, and then go back to ccl directory:
# You'll want the last 10 hex digits to match those of the
# output from the "git rev-parse HEAD" command above: do
# that twice here and once further below.
mv temp 2017-12-07-6be8298fe5
cd 2017-12-07-6be8298fe5/ccl

# Build the lisp kernel in the appropriate directory:
# NOTE: This is for linux; if you are on a Mac then instead
# change instead to lisp-kernel/darwinx8664/.
cd lisp-kernel/linuxx8664/
make clean && make

# Move back to ccl directory and fetch/unpack the heap image.
cd ../../
# If you don't have wget (e.g., on a Mac), skip this wget command and see just below).
wget https://github.com/Clozure/ccl/releases/download/v1.12-dev.1/linuxx86.tar.gz
# Or instead, if you don't have wget, e.g. on a Mac:
# curl --location https://github.com/Clozure/ccl/releases/download/v1.12-dev.1/darwinx86.tar.gz > darwinx86.tar.gz
# Now untar.  NOTE: This is for linux.
# For a Mac: tar xfz darwinx86.tar.gz
tar xfz linuxx86.tar.gz

# Rebuild the kernel (on a Mac: ./dx86cl64)
./lx86cl64
# This welcomes you, e.g.:
#   Clozure Common Lisp Version 1.12-dev/v1.12-dev.1  (LinuxX8664)
# Now submit this command:
? (rebuild-ccl :full t)
# After it returns, quit:
? (quit)
# Now, back at the shell, rebuild the kernel again just to be safe:
# For a Mac: ./dx86cl64
./lx86cl64
? (rebuild-ccl :full t)
? (quit)
</pre>

Finally, create an executable script like the following.
Be sure to change the name ("2017-12-07-6be8298fe5") to
match the name change already made above.

<pre>
#!/bin/sh

export CCL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY=/projects/acl2/lisps/ccl/2017-12-07-6be8298fe5/ccl
${CCL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY}/scripts/ccl64 "$@"
</pre>

<hr size=3 noshade>

Make sure that your script is executable, e.g.:

<pre>
chmod +x my-script
</pre>
