;; think of abbreviation variables as standing for something else only
;; when they're in variable position, but the problem with that
;; approach is that we can't tell about the position until we've done
;; the translation (consider macro calls that look at the first
;; character, say, for example).  On a pragmatic (implementation)
;; level, it's hard to see how to implement a translator that
;; substitutes for abbreviation variables only when they're in
;; variable position, except by modifying translate.  On the other
;; hand, for untranslation the specification is only that
;; (trans (untrans x)) = x, where here translation is with respect
;; to abbreviations.  Notice though that this spec messes things
;; up, because if x is (quote &v) then untrans of that is still
;; (quote &v) but then trans would remove the &v, if we use sublis
;; to deal with abbreviations.

;; So, I think I'll implement abbreviations as follows.  There will
;; be a new "macro":

;; (defmacro ? (x)
;;   (cdr (assoc-eq x (abbreviations))))

;; Notice however that (abbreviations) generates a reference to
;; state, which isn't compatible with ? being a macro.  So, I'll
;; stub it out:

(defmacro ? (x)
  `(?-fn ',x))

;; The proof-builder's enabled state will be either the global enabled
;; state or else a local one.  The proof-builder command :IN-THEORY
;; takes zero or one arguments, the former specifying ``use the global
;; enabled state'' and the latter specifying ``create a local enabled
;; state from the current proof-builder enabled state by evaluating
;; the theory form that is given.''  This is an easy design to
;; implement:  we'll use NIL in the pc-ens component of the pc-state
;; to mean that we should use the global state, and otherwise we'll
;; store an enabled structure with a root name particular to Pc-ACL2.
;; A subtlety is that (in-theory (current-theory :here)) is not quite
;; equivalent to (in-theory).  The difference is that the former
;; stores a copy of the current global enabled state in the current
;; proof-builder state, and that's what will stay there even if the
;; global state is changed, while the latter stores NIL in the current
;; proof-builder state, which means that we'll use whatever is the
;; current global enabled state at the time.

;; I expect that this design will be pretty robust, in the sense that
;; it won't cause hard errors even when the user makes global changes
;; to the ACL2 world and then re-enters an interactive verification.
;; That's because the index-of-last-enabling component of an enabled
;; structure always protects it against inappropriate AREF1 calls
