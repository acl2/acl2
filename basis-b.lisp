; suffixes from there.  Since no legal variable begins with #\* or #\&, we tack

; If prefix is empty, we use "V".

; Note: This system will eventually contain a lot of code to generate

; Essay on Abbreviating Live Stobjs

; Right now the live state is abbreviated as <state> when it is printed, and
; the user's live stobj $s is abbreviated as <$s>.  It would be cool if the
; user could specify how he or she wants a stobj displayed, e.g., by selecting
; key components for printing or by providing a function which maps the stobj
; to some non-stobj ``stand-in'' or eviscerated object for printing.

; I have given this matter several hours' thought and abandoned it for the
; moment.  I am not convinced it is worth the trouble.  It IS a lot of trouble.

; We eviscerate stobjs in the read-eval-print loop.  (Through Version_4.3, we
; also eviscerated stobjs in a very low-level place: ev-fncall-msg (and its
; more pervasive friend, ev-fncall-guard-er), used to print stobjs involved in
; calls of functions on args that violate a guard.)

; Every stobj must have some ``stand-in transformer'' function, fn.  We will
; typically be holding a stobj name, e.g., $S, and a live value, val, e.g.,
; (#(777) #(1 2 3 ...)), and wish to obtain some ACL2 object to print in place
; of the value.  This value is obtained by applying fn to val.  The two main
; issues I see are

; (a) where do we find fn?  The candidate places are state, world, and val
; itself.  But we do not have state available in the low-level code.

; (b) how do we apply fn to val?  The obvious thing is to call trans-eval or do
; an ev-fncall.  Again, we need state.  Furthermore, depending on how we do it,
; we have to fight a syntactic battle of ``casting'' an arbitrary object, val,
; to a stobj of type name, to apply a function which has a STOBJS-IN of (name).
; A more important problem is the one of order-of-definition.  Which is defined
; first: how to eviscerate a stobj or how to evaluate a form?  Stobj
; evisceration calls evaluation to apply fn, but evaluation calls stobj
; evisceration to report guard errors.

; Is user-specified stobj abbreviation really worth the trouble?

; One idea that presents itself is that val ``knows how to abbreviate itself.''
; I think this is akin to the idea of having a :program mode function, say
; stobj-standin, which syntactically takes a non-stobj and returns a non-stobj.
; Actually, stobj-standin would be called on val.  It is clear that I could
; define this function in raw lisp: look in *the-live-state* to determine how
; to abbreviate val and then just do it.  But what would be the logical
; definition of it?  We could leave it undefined, or defined to be an undefined
; function.  Until we admit the whole ACL2 system :logically, we could even
; define it in the logic to be t even though it really returned something else,
; since as a :program its logical definition is irrelevant.  But at the moment
; I don't think ACL2 has a precedent for such a function and I don't think
; user-specified stobj abbreviation is justification enough for doing it.

; We now develop code for computing checksums of objects.  There are two
; separate algorithms, culminating respectively in functions old-check-sum-obj

; Version_3.4, which uses an algorithm similar to that of our file-based
; function, check-sum.  However, the #+hons version of ACL2 was being used on
; large cons trees with significant subtree sharing.  These "galactic" trees
; could have relatively few distinct cons cells but a huge naive node count.
; It was thus desirable to memoize the computation of checksums, which was
; impossible using the existing algorithm because it modified state.

; The second development was contributed by Jared Davis (and is now maintained
; by the ACL2 developers, who are responsible for any errors).  It is amenable
; to memoization and, indeed, fchecksum-obj is memoized in the #+hons version
; of ACL2.  We say more after developing the code for the first algorithm,
; culminating in function check-sum-obj1.

; We turn now to the first development (which is no longer used in ACL2).

; obj is not composed entirely of conses, symbols, strings, rationals, complex
; rationals, and characters. If the first value is not an integer, it is one of
; the offending objects encoutered.

; We typically use this function to compute check sums of cert-obj records and
; of objects of the form (cons expansion-alist ev-lst) where ev-lst is the list
; of forms in a book, including the initial in-package, and expansion-alist
; comes from make-event expansion.

; We now develop code for the second checksum algorithm, contributed by Jared
; Davis (now maintained by the ACL2 developers, who are responsible for any
; errors).  See also the long comment after check-sum-obj, below.

; Our initial attempts however were a problem for GCL, which boxes fixnums
; unless one is careful.  A regression took about 44 or 45 minutes instead of
; 35 or 36 minutes, which is really significant considering that (probably)
; only the checksum code was changed, and one would expect checksums to take a
; trivial fraction of time during a regression.  Therefore, we developed code
; to avoid boxing fixnums in GCL during a common operation: multiplication mod
; M31 = #x7fffffff.  The code below is developed only for defining that
; operation, times-mod-m31; so we could conditionalize with #+gcl all
; definitions below up to times-mod-m31.  We believe that the following is a
; theorem, but we have not proved it (nor even admitted the relevant functions
; into :logic mode):

; (implies (and (natp x) (< x #x7fffffff)
;               (natp y) (< y #x7fffffff))
;          (equal (times-mod-m31 x y)
;                 (rem (* x y) #x7fffffff)))

; We considered using our fancy times-mod-m31 and its subfunctions for other
; than GCL.  The time loss for ACL2h built on CCL 1.2 (actually
; 1.2-r10991M-trunk) on DarwinX8664 was only about 3.2%, which seems worth the
; cost in order to avoid having Lisp-specific code.  However, regression runs
; with ACL2 built on Allegro CL exhibited intermittent checksumming errors.  We
; wonder about a possible compiler bug, since neither heavy addition of checks,
; nor running with safety 3 (both ACL2h on CCL and ACL2 on Allegro CL) showed
; any inappropriate type declarations in the code below, and there were no
; checksumming problems exhibited with CCL, GCL, or SBCL.  Moreover, Allegro CL
; showed significant slow down with the fancy times-mod-m31, not surprisingly
; since Allegro CL supports fixnums of less than 32 bits.  Therefore, we
; decided to use a much simpler times-mod-m31 for all Lisps except GCL.

(defun fchecksum-natural-aux (n ans)

; A "functional" checksum for natural numbers.
;
;   N is the natural number we want to checksum.
;   ANS is the answer we have accumulated so far.
;
; Let M31 be 2^31 - 1.  This happens to be the largest representable 32-bit
; signed number using 2's complement arithmetic.  It is also a Mersenne prime.
; Furthermore, let P1 be 392894102, which is a nice, large primitive root of
; M31.  From number theory, we can construct a basic pseudorandom number
; generator as follows:
;
;   rnd0 = seed
;   rnd1 = (rnd0 * P1) mod M31
;   rnd2 = (rnd1 * P1) mod M31
;   ...
;
; And our numbers will not repeat until 2^31 - 1.  In fact, such a generator
; is found in the community book "misc/random."
;
; Our checksum algorithm uses this idea in a slightly different way.  Given a
; 31-bit natural number, K, think of (K * P1) mod M31 as a way to "shuffle" the
; bits of K around in a fairly random manner.  Then, to checksum a (potentially
; large) integer n, we break n up into 31-bit chunks, call them K1, K2, ...,
; Km.  We then compute (Ki * P1) mod M31 for each i, and xor the results all
; together to compute a new, 31-bit checksum.

; A couple of other notes.
;
;  - M31 may be written as #x7FFFFFFF.
;
;  - We recur using (ash n -31), but this computes the same thing as (truncate
;    n (expt 2 31)).
;
;  - We split n into Ki by using (logand n #x7FFFFFFF), which is the same as
;    (rem n (expt 2 31)).

; A "functional" checksum for strings.

; We consider the string in 31-bit pieces; each character in the string has,

(defun symbol-class (sym wrld)

; The symbol-class of a symbol is one of three keywords:

; :program                  - not defined within the logic
; :ideal                 - defined in the logic but not known to be CL compliant
; :common-lisp-compliant - defined in the logic and known to be compliant with
;                          Common Lisp

; Convention: We never print the symbol-classes to the user.  We would prefer
; the user not to think about these classes per se.  It encourages a certain
; confusion, we think, because users want everything to be
; common-lisp-compliant and start thinking of it as a mode, sort of like "super
; :logic" or something.  So we are keeping these names to ourselves by not
; using them in error messages and documentation.  Typically used English
; phrases are such and such is "compliant with Common Lisp" or "is not known to
; be compliant with Common Lisp."

; Historical Note: :Program function symbols were once called "red", :ideal
; symbols were once called "blue", and :common-lisp-compliant symbols were once
; called "gold."

; Before we describe the storage scheme, let us make a few observations.
; First, most function symbols have the :program symbol-class, because until
; ACL2 is admitted into the logic, the overwhelming majority of the function
; symbols will be system functions.  Second, all :logic function symbols have
; symbol-class :ideal or :common-lisp-compliant.  Third, this function,
; symbol-class, is most often applied to :logic function symbols, because most
; often we use it to sweep through the function symbols in a term before
; verify-guards.  Finally, theorem names are very rarely of interest here but
; they are always either :ideal or (very rarely) :common-lisp-compliant.

; Therefore, our storage scheme is that every :logic function will have a
; symbol-class property that is either :ideal or :common-lisp-compliant.  We
; will not store a symbol-class property for :program but just rely on the
; absence of the property (and the fact that the symbol is recognized as a
; function symbol) to default its symbol-class to :program.  Thus, system
; functions take no space but are slow to answer.  Finally, theorems will
; generally have no stored symbol-class (so it will default to :ideal for them)
; but when it is stored it will be :common-lisp-compliant.

; Note that the defun-mode of a symbol is actually determined by looking at its
; symbol-class.  We only store the symbol-class.  That is more often the
; property we need to look at.  But we believe it is simpler for the user to
; think in terms of :mode and :verify-guards.

; To make it easy to reference them and to ensure that they are set to legal
