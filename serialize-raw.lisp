; INTRODUCTION
;
; We now develop a serialization scheme that allows ACL2 objects to be saved to
; disk using a compact, structure-shared, binary encoding.
;
; We configure ACL2's print-object$ function so that it writes objects with our
; encoding scheme when writing certificate files.  This allows large objects
; produced by make-event to be read and written efficiently.
;
; We extend the ACL2 readtable so that serialized objects can be read at any
; time, using the extended reader macros #Y[...] and #Z[...].  These macros are
; almost identical, but
;
;    #Y rebuilds the object entirely with CONS and does not restore any
;       fast alists, whereas
;
;    #Z uses HONS for the parts of the structure that were originally normed,
;       and rebuilds the hash tables for fast alists.
;
; We provide routines for reading and writing ACL2 objects as individual files,
; typically with a ".sao" extension for "Serialized ACL2 Object".  For
; bootstrapping reasons, these are introduced in hons.lisp and hons-raw.lisp
; instead of here in serialize-raw.lisp.

; Essay on Bad Objects and Serialize
;
; When we decode serialized objects, must we ensure that the object returned is
; a valid ACL2 object, i.e., not something that BAD-LISP-OBJECTP would reject?
;
; Matt and Jared think the answer is "no" for the reader macros.  Why?  These
; macros are just extensions of certain readtables like the *acl2-readtable*,
; which are used by READ to interpret input.  But there are already any number
; of other ways for READ to produce bad objects, for instance it might produce a
; floating point numbers, symbols in a foreign package, vectors, structures,
; etc.  The "Remarks on *acl2-readtable*" in acl2.lisp has more discussion of
; these matters.  At any rate, whenever ACL2 is using READ, it already needs to
; be defending against bad objects, so it should be okay if the serialize reader
; macros generate bad objects.
;
; However, Jared thinks that the serialize-read-fn function *is* responsible for
; ensuring that only good objects are read, because it is a "new" way for input
; to enter the system.
;
; Well, the serialized object format is considerably more restrictive than the
; Common Lisp reader, and does not provide any way to encode floats, circular
; objects, etc.  Jared thinks the only bad objects that can be produced from
; serialized reading are symbols in unknown packages.  So, in
; serialize-read-file we pass in a flag that makes sure we check whether
; packages are known.  We think this is sufficient to justify not checking
; BAD-LISP-OBJECTP explicitly.

; Essay on the Serialize Object Format
;
; Our scheme involves encoding ACL2 objects into a fairly simple, byte-based,
; binary format.
;
; There are actually three different formats of serialized objects, named V1,
; V2 and V3.  For compatibility with previously written files, we support
; reading from all three file formats.  But we always write files using the
; newest, V3 format.
;
; Why these different versions?
;
;    V1.  We originally developed our serialization scheme as a ttag-based
;         library in :dir :system, but this left us with no way to tightly
;         integrate it into ACL2's certificate printing/reading routines.
;
;    V2. When we moved serialization into ACL2 proper, we noticed a few things
;        that we could improve, and tweaked the serialization scheme.  The new
;        scheme, V2, wasn't compatible with community book books/serialize, but
;        we already had many files written in the old V1 format.
;
;    V3. Later, we realized that it would be easy to restore fast alists within
;        serialized objects, and that this would allow the fast alists defined
;        in a book to still be fast after including the book.  The new format,
;        V3, added this feature, but again we had lots of V2 files that we
;        still wanted to be able to read.
;
; Eventually we should be able to drop support for the old versions, but the
; formats are all very similar so supporting them is not that much work.  Since
; all of the versions are very similar, we begin with the V1 format.  A
; sequence of objects is encoded by OBJECT: first MAGIC, then LEN, then the
; indicated homogeneous sequences of objects, and then MAGIC.
;
;   OBJECT ::= MAGIC                       ; marker for sanity checking
;              LEN                         ; total number of objects
;              NATS RATS COMPLEXES CHARS   ; object data
;              STRS PACKAGES CONSES        ;
;              MAGIC                       ; marker for sanity checking
;
;   NATS      ::= LEN NAT*        ; number of nats, followed by that many nats
;   RATS      ::= LEN RAT*        ; number of rats, followed by that many rats
;   COMPLEXES ::= LEN COMPLEX*    ; etc.
;   CHARS     ::= LEN CHAR*
;   STRS      ::= LEN STR*
;   PACKAGES  ::= LEN PACKAGE*
;   CONSES    ::= LEN CONS*
;
;   RAT ::= NAT NAT NAT           ; sign (0 or 1), numerator, denominator
;   COMPLEX ::= RAT RAT           ; real, imaginary parts
;   CHAR ::= byte                 ; the character code for this character
;   STR ::= LEN CHAR*             ; length and then its characters
;   PACKAGE ::= STR LEN STR*      ; package name, number of symbols, symbol names
;   CONS ::= NAT NAT              ; "index" of its car and cdr (see below)
;
;   LEN ::= NAT                   ; just to show when we're referring to a length
;
;   MAGIC ::= #xAC120BC7          ; also see the discussion below
;
;   NAT ::= [see below]
;
; You can experiment with these formats, for example as follows in raw Lisp.
;
;   (let ((str (with-output-to-string (s) (ser-encode-to-stream 5/2 s))))
;        (loop for i from 0 to (1- (length str))
;              collect (char-code (char str i))))
;
;
; Magic Numbers.  The magic number, #xAC120BC7, is a 32-bit integer that sort
; of looks like "ACL2 OBCT", i.e., "ACL2 Object."  This use of magic numbers is
; probably silly, but may have some advantages:
;
;   (1) It lets us do a basic sanity check.
;
;   (2) When serialize is used to write out whole files, helps to ensure the
;       file doesn't start with valid ASCII characters.  This *might* help
;       protect these files from tampering by programs that convert newline
;       characters in text files (e.g., FTP programs).
;
;   (3) It gives us the option of tweaking our encoding.  Today we use distinct
;       magic numbers to identify V1, V2, and V3 files, and in the future we
;       could add additional encodings by adding other magic numbers.
;
;
; Naturals.  Our representation of NAT is slightly involved since we need to
; support arbitrary-sized natural numbers.  We use a variable-length encoding
; where the most significant bit of each byte is 0 if this is the last piece of
; the number, or 1 if there are additional bytes, and the other 7 bits are data
; bits.  The bytes are kept in little-endian order.  For example:
;
;      0 is encoded as   #x00       (continue bit: 0, data: 0)
;      2 is encoded as   #x02       (continue bit: 0, data: 2)
;       ...
;      127 is encoded as #x7F       (continue bit: 0, data: 127)
;      128 is encoded as #x80 #x01  [(c: 1, d: 0) = 0] + 128*[(c: 0, d: 1) = 1]
;      129 is encoded as #x81 #x01  [(c: 1, d: 1) = 1] + 128*[(c: 0, d: 1) = 1]
;      519 is encoded as #x87 #x04  [(c: 1, d: 7) = 7] + 128*[(c: 0, d: 4) = 4]
;    16383 is encoded as #xFF #x7F
;          [(c: 1, d: 127) = 127] + 128 * [(c: 0, d: 127) = 127]
;    16384 is encoded as #x80 #x80 #x01
;          [(c: 1, d:   0) =   0] + 128 * [(c: 0, d:   0) =   0]
;                                 + 128^2*[(c: 0, d:   1) =   1]
;    16387 is encoded as #x83 #x80 #x01
;          [(c: 1, d:   3) =   3] + 128 * [(c: 0, d:   0) =   0]
;                                 + 128^2*[(c: 0, d:   1) =   1]
;       ...
;
;
; Negative Integers.  Negative integers aren't mentioned in the file format
; because we encode them as rationals with denominator 1.  This only requires 2
; bytes of overhead (for the sign and denominator) beyond the magnitude of the
; integer, which seems acceptable since negative integers aren't especially
; frequent.
;
;
; Conses.  Every object in the file has an (implicit) index, determined by its
; position in the file.  The naturals are given the smallest indices 0, 1, 2,
; and so on.  Supposing there are N naturals, the rationals will have indices
; N, N+1, etc.  After that we have the complexes, then the characters, strings,
; symbols, and finally the conses.
;
; We encode conses using these indices.  For instance, suppose the first two
; natural numbers in our file are 37 and 55.  Since we start our indexing with
; the naturals, 37 will have index 0 and 55 will have index 1.  Then, we can
; encode the cons (37 . 55) by just writing down these two indices, e.g., #x00
; #x01.
;
; We insist that sub-trees of conses come first in the file, so as we are
; decoding the file, whenever we construct a cons we can make sure its indices
; refer to already-constructed conses.
;
; The object with the maximal index is "the object" that has been saved,
; and is returned by the #Y and #Z readers, or by the whole-file reader,
; serialize-read.
;
;
; The V2 Format.  The V2 format is almost the same as the V1 format, but with
; the following changes that allow us to restore the normedness of conses.
;
;   (1) The magic number changes to #xAC120BC8, so we know which format is
;       being used,
;
;   (2) We tweak the way indices are handled so that NIL and T are implicitly
;       given index 0 and 1, respectively (i.e., we do not actually write out
;       those symbols), which can sometimes slightly improve compression for
;       cons structures that have lots of NILs and Ts within them (since
;       without this tweak, NIL and T might have large indices that are
;       represented using many bytes).
;
;   (3) We change the way conses are represented so we can mark which conses
;       were normed.  Instead of recording a cons by writing down its car-index
;       and cdr-index verbatim, we now instead write down:
;
;           (car-index << 1) | (if honsp 1 0), cdr-index
;
;       Because of the way we encode naturals, this neatly only costs an extra
;       byte if the car-index happens to have an integer length that is a
;       multiple of 7.  (To see this, note that our encoding is essentially a
;       base-128 encoding, so we need an extra "digit" only when the top 7-bit
;       "digit" has its top bit set to 1.)
;
;   (4) Instead of the total number of objects, we replace LEN with the maximum
;       index of the object to be read.  Usually this just means that instead
;       of LEN we record LEN - 1.  But it allows us to detect the special case
;       of NIL where the object being encoded is not necessarily at LEN - 1.
;
;
; The V3 format.  The V3 format is almost the same as the V2 format, but with
; the following changes that allow us to restore fast alists.
;
;   (1) The magic number changes to #xAC120BC9, and
;
;   (2) We extend the OBJECT format with an extra FALS field, that comes
;       after the conses.  Note that LEN is unchanged and does not count
;       the FALS.
;
;         OBJECT ::= MAGIC                       ; marker for sanity checking
;                    LEN                         ; total number of objects
;                    NATS RATS COMPLEXES CHARS   ; object data
;                    STRS PACKAGES CONSES        ;
;                    FALS
;                    MAGIC                       ; marker for sanity checking
;
;         FALS ::= FAL* 0                        ; zero-terminated list
;
;         FAL ::= NAT NAT                        ; index and hash-table-count
;
;   (3) We change the encoding of STR so that we can mark which strings were
;       normed.  In place of recording the string's LEN, we instead record:
;          (len << 1) | (if honsp 1 0)

; WHY DO WE USE 8-BIT BLOCKS?
;
; Originally I tried using 64-bit blocks.  I thought this would mean only 1/64
; of the bits would be "overhead" for continue-bits, and surely this would be
; better than using 8-bit blocks, where 1/8 of the bits would be continue-bit
; overhead.
;
; This thinking is totally wrong.  It ignores another important source of
; overhead: the unnecessary data-bits in the final block.  To make this very
; concrete, think about encoding the number 5.  We only "need" 3 bits.  In an
; 8-bit encoding, we use 8 bits so the overhead is 5/8 = 62%.  But in a 64-bit
; encoding we would need 64 bits for an overhead of 61/64 = 95%.  So the 8-bit
; encoding is much more efficient for small integers.
;
; Another potential disadvantage of 64-bit blocks may seem to be that 64-bit
; numbers are not fixnums in CCL (or perhaps any Lisp circa 2014 or for years
; to come).  However, that issue is probably actually quite minor; 8 8-bit
; fixnums quite possibly use more memory than one 64-bit bignum.
;
; Of course, there are cases where 64-bit blocks win.  For instance, 2^62
; nicely fits into a single 64-bit block, but requires 9 8-bit blocks (at 7
; data bits apiece), i.e., 72 bits.  But on some other larger numbers, 8-bit
; blocks can still be more efficient.  Take 2^64.  Here, we need either 2
; 64-bit blocks (at 63 data bits apiece) for 128 bits, or 10 8-bit blocks for
; 80 bits.  In short, the wider encoding only wins when the numbers are very
; long, or when there aren't very many unnecessary data bits in the final
; block.

; WHY ALL THESE OPTIMIZATIONS?
;
; The performance of natural number encoding/decoding is especially important
; because we have to (1) encode/decode two naturals for every cons, and (2)
; encode/decode naturals all over the place for string lengths, symbol name
; lengths, and the representation of any number.  These optimizations are a big
; deal: on one example benchmark, they improve CCL's decoding performance by
; almost 20% (as opposed to using just ser-encode-nat-large to encode
; naturals).

; We don't want to pay the price of writing down the package for every symbol

; causes an error if it the package isn't known.  Note that we only have to do
; this once per package, so this is a very low-cost check.
;
; If checking packages is so cheap, why not just check packages all the time?

; cons tables are only EQ hash tables.  Because of this, EQUAL-but-not-EQ
; strings and conses may be bound in their seen tables.
;
; We make no effort to avoid "redundantly" writing EQUAL-but-not-EQ conses or
; strings.  Of course, a HONS user could first hons-copy their object to
; achieve full structure sharing.  This would perhaps improve read time at the

; write them out using our encoders for lists of naturals, rationals, etc.
;
; The accumulators for naturals, rationals, complexes, strings, and characters

; our processor.  My Verilog translator produced objects with lots of strings,
; and in many cases these strings could be different, e.g., if you parsed a
; module with:
;
;     module m ( ..., foo, ... );
;        input foo;
;        assign ... = foo;
;        ...
;     endmodule
;
; then you could end up with lots of different strings that all said "foo".
; Note also that in this context, I really wanted to optimize for read time
; instead of write time (a script made the processor models at night, where
; time is irrelevant, but I needed to read them in while developing proofs.)
; At any rate, for these reasons, I really wanted to avoid writing out
; redundant strings.
;
; My first idea was to just use an EQUAL hash table for seen-str, but this
; turned out to be far too slow.
;
; Instead, I developed a fancy scheme.  First, the seen-str was only an EQ hash
; table.  But when encoding the collected strings, I (1) sorted them using
; Lisp's SORT function, which is a stable sort, and (2) assigned their indices
; using a tricky function that looked for adjacent EQUAL strings, and reused
; the index in this case.  The net effect was that all strings would be
; canonicalized to some representative.  This was probably a performance win
; because, instead of having to EQUAL-hash at each occurrence of the string, we
; only have to EQ hash and then do one global sort at the end.  (It probably
; would have worked just as well to use separate EQ and EQUAL hash tables.)
;
; This scheme was used in V1 and V2.  However, in V3, where we started to
; record whether strings were normed, and restore them to their normed status,
; we ran into a problem.
;
; Suppose there are two EQUAL-but-not-EQ strings,
;    - X (which is normed) and
;    - Y (which is not).
;
; Under our canonicalization scheme, we would choose one of these as the
; canonical form "at random."  (Actually the winner just depended on which we
; first encountered, but you can think of that as basically random.)  At any
; rate, this could two bad outcomes:
;
;    (1) Y could be canonicalized to X, and hence become normed.  This seems
;        basically fine and is probably nothing to be worried about unless some
;        TTAG code is depending on it being different from Y, which wouldn't be
;        sound anyway).
;
;    (2) X could be canonicalized to Y, and hence lose its normed status.  This
;        is bad because if X is being used as a fast alist key, we will have
;        trouble restoring that alist.
;
; It seems easy enough to fix this by norming the string whenever ANY of its
; EQUAL-but-not-EQ partners are normed.  But instead, we now just do not try to
; avoid writing out redundant strings.  Why not?
;
;   - It was somewhat complicated and ugly, and the fix seems kind of gross.
;
;   - Sorting the strings slows down writing, and write speed is now more
;     important than it used to be.  We used to only write out our processor
;     models with an automated script.  But now serialize is used to print
;     certificates, etc., and while write speed is certainly still less
;     important than read speed, it is at least somewhat important.
;
;   - EQUAL-but-not-EQ strings don't seem that prevalent anyway, e.g., we now
;     judiciously use HONS-COPY to normalize strings in the Verilog parser,
;     etc., and other users can do the same if they think EQUAL-but-not-EQ
;     copies of a string are likely to occur.

(defun ser-make-atom-map (encoder)

; After the atoms have been gathered we want to assign them unique indices.
; These indices will need to agree with the implicit order of the indices in
; the serialized file.  So, we need to assign indices to the naturals first,
; then the rationals, etc.
;
; In earlier versions of serialize, we constructed "atom map" structures that
; were hash tables binding atoms to their indices.  These atom maps were new
; structures that were unrelated to the seen-tables above.
;
; But now, for considerably better performance and memory efficiency, we
; instead smash the seen-tables and convert them into index mappings.  That is,
; during SER-GATHER-ATOMS above, the seen tables just bound the objects we had
; seen to T.  Now we are going to smash these bindings and replace them with
; their indices.  This is especially efficient because their hash tables have
; already been grown to the proper sizes.
;
; Before we this smashing process, we check that the maximum index we will ever
; need is going to be a fixnum.  Because of this, throughout this code we can
; assume that all indices are always fixnums.
;
; Future optimization potential.  It might be possible to do the index
; assignment inline with atom gathering, by keeping separate track of how many
; naturals we have seen, how many characters, etc., and storing only
; type-relative offsets into the atom maps instead of absolute indices.  This
; might be worthwhile: it should significantly reduce the amount of hashing we
; need to do.

;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

; See also the Essay on Fast Alists in hons-raw.lisp.  The FAL-HT binds some
; alists to hash tables.  Some of these alists might be conses that we've just
; written out.  For each such alist, we just want to record its index.
;
; Our basic approach to restoring fast alists is as follows.  First, we encode
; the whole object -- we gather its atoms, assign indices to them, and write
; out all the consing instructions -- without any regard to which alists inside
; of it are fast.  Then we tack on some fast-alist information.
;
; Once the whole object has been encoded, we look at the FALTABLE from the Hons
; Space.  Recall that the FALTABLE binds alists to their backing hash tables.
; For each entry in the FALTABLE, we check whether the alist has been assigned
; an index in the encoder's SEEN-CONS table.  I.e., we check whether the alist
; was part of the object we just encoded.  If so, we write down a FAL
; instruction that describes how to rebuild the hash table.
;
; This seems pretty efficient: each FAL instruction is only two natural
; numbers, so the real added cost to encoding is just N hash table lookups,
; where N is the size of the FALTABLE, and the cost of encoding 2M naturals
; where M is the number of fast alists actually in the object.
;
; An encoded FAL instruction is a pair of natural numbers, INDEX and COUNT.
; The INDEX is just the looked up index of the alist, itself.  The COUNT is the
; hash-table-count of the backing hash table, so that when we recreate the hash
; table we can initialize it with approximately the correct size.
;
; So how does decoding work?  Since the FAL instructions come at the end of the
; object, we already have restored the whole object by the time we get to them.
; In other words, the INDEX that we read tells us where, in the decode array,
; we can find the alist that was fast.  Assuming we are using smart honsing or
; always honsing, then the keys of the ALIST should already be honsed, because
; it was a fast alist and so its keys had to be honses.  So all we need to do
; is rebuild the hash table for this alist and install it into the FAL table,
; which is very easy.
;
; We zero-terminate the FALS instead of writing down the number of FALS first.
; This is legitimate because 0 is always the index of NIL, and NIL cannot be
; bound in the FALTABLE, so there is no ambiguity.  It is desirable because as
; we encode, we do not know how many FAL instructions we will actually need to
; write out.  Likewise, as we decode we do not need to know how many FAL
; instructions will be processed.

(defun ser-encode-fals (encoder)
  (declare (type ser-encoder encoder))

; Q: Why include the hash table's count, when the decoder could just take the
; length of the alist instead?
;
; A: Since the alist can have shadowed pairs, so its length may not be a very
; good indication of the size we should use.  We could end up with a much
; larger hash table than we really need.
;
; Q: Why use the hash-table-count instead of the hash-table-size?
;
; A: If a fast alist has been saved in a book, we think it is relatively
; unlikely that it is going to be modified by a sub-book.  It seems more likely
; that it is some kind of lookup table that you intend to refer to over and
