; Essay on Enabling, Enabled Structures, and Theories

; The rules used by the system can be "enabled" and "disabled".  In a
; break with Nqthm, this is true even of :COMPOUND-RECOGNIZER rules.
; We develop that code now.  Some of the fundamental concepts here are
; that of "rule names" or "runes" and their associated numeric
; correspondents, numes.  We also explain "mapping pairs," "rule name
; designators", "theories," (both "common theories" and "runic
; theories") and "enabled structures".

(defun assoc-equal-cdr (x alist)

; Like assoc-equal but compares against the cdr of each pair in alist.

  (declare (xargs :mode :logic ; might as well put this into :logic mode
                  :guard (alistp alist)))
  (cond ((endp alist) nil)
        ((equal x (cdar alist)) (car alist))
        (t (assoc-equal-cdr x (cdr alist)))))

(defun runep (x wrld)

; This function returns non-nil iff x is a rune, i.e., a "rule name,"
; in wrld.  When non-nil, the value of this function is the nume of
; the rune x, i.e., the index allocated to this rule name in the
; enabled array.  This function returns nil on fake-runes!  See the
; essay on fake-runes below.

; To clear up the confusion wrought by the proliferation of
; nomenclature surrounding rules and the ways by which one might refer
; to them, I have recently adopted more colorful nomenclature than the
; old "rule name," "rule index," "rule id," etc.  To wit,

; rune (rule name):
; an object that is syntactically of the form (token symb . x), where
; token is one of the rule-class tokens, e.g., :REWRITE, :META, etc.,
; symb is a symbolp with a 'runic-mapping-pairs property, and x is
; either nil or a positive integer that distinguishes this rune from
; others generated from different :rule-classes that share the same
; token and symb.  We say that (token symb . x) is "based" on the
; symbol symb.  Formally, rn is a rune iff it is of the form (& symb
; . &), symb is a symbolp with a non-nil runic-info and rn is in the
; range of the mapping-pairs of that runic-info.  This is just another
; way of saying that the range of the mapping pairs of a symbol is a
; complete list of all of the runes based on that symbol.  Each rule
; in the system has a unique rune that identifies it.  The user may
; thus refer to any rule by its rune.  An ordered list of runes is a
; theory (though we also permit some non-runes in theories presented
; by the user).  Each rune has a status, enabled or disabled, as given
; by an enabled structure.  I like the name "rune" because its
; etymology (from "rule name") is clear and it connotes an object that
; is at once obscure, atomic, and yet clearly understood by the
; scholar.

; nume (the numeric counterpart of a rune):
; a nonnegative integer uniquely associated with a rune.  The nume of
; a rune tells us where in the enabled array we find the status of the
; rune.

; runic mapping pair:
; a pair, (nume . rune), consisting of a rune and its numeric
; counterpart, nume.  The 'runic-mapping-pairs property of a symbol is
; the list of all runic mapping pairs whose runes are based on the
; given symbol.  The 'runic-mapping-pairs value is ordered by
; ascending numes, i.e., the first nume in the list is the least.  The
; primary role of runic mapping pairs is to make it more efficient to
; load a theory (ideally a list of runes) into an enabled structure.
; That process requires that we assemble an ACL2 array, i.e., an alist
; mapping array indices (numes) to their values (runes) in the array.
; We do that by collecting the runic mapping pairs of each rune in the
; theory.  We also use these pairs to sort theories: theories are kept
; in descending nume order to make intersection and union easier.  To
; sort a theory we replace each rune in it by its mapping pair, sort
; the result by descending cars, and then strip out the runes to obtain
; the answer.  More on this when we discuss sort-by-fnume.

; event name:
; The symbol, symb, in a rune (token symb . x), is an event name.
; Some event names are allowed in theories, namely, those that are the
; base symbols of runes.  In such usage, an event name stands for one
; or more runes, depending on what kind of event it names.  For
; example, if APP is the name of a defun'd function, then when APP
; appears in a theory it stands for the rune (:DEFINITION APP).  If
; ASSOC-OF-APP is a lemma name, then when it appears in a theory it
; stands for all the runes based on that name, e.g., if that event
; introduced two rewrite rules and an elim rule, then ASSOC-OF-APP
; would stand for (:REWRITE ASSOC-OF-APP . 1), (:REWRITE ASSOC-OF-APP
; . 2), and (:ELIM ASSOC-OF-APP).  This use of event names allows them
; to be confused with rule names.

; Historical Footnote: In nqthm, the executable-counterpart of the
; function APP actually had a distinct name, *1*APP, and hence we
; established the expectation that one could prevent the use of that
; "rule" while allowing the use of the other.  We now use the runes
; (:DEFINITION APP) and (:EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART APP) to identify
; those two rules added by a defun event.  In fact, the defun adds a
; third rule, named by the rune (:TYPE-PRESCRIPTION APP).  In fact, we
; were driven to the invention of runes as unique rule names when we
; added type-prescription lemmas.

; Essay on Fake-Runes

; The system has many built in rules that, for regularity, ought to
; have names and numes but don't because they can never be disabled.
; In addition, we sometimes wish to have a rune-like object we can use
; as a mark, without having to worry about the possibility that a
; genuine rune will come along with the same identity.  Therefore, we
; have invented the notion of "fake-runes."  Fake runes are constants.
; By convention, the constant name is always of the form
; *fake-rune-...* and the value of every fake rune is always
; (:FAKE-RUNE-... nil).  Since no rule class will ever start with the
; words "fake rune" this convention will survive the introduction of
; all conceivable new rule classes.  It is important that fake runes
; be based on the symbol nil.  This way they are assigned the nume
; nil by fnume (below) and will always be considered enabled.  The
; function runep does NOT recognize fake runes.  Fake runes cannot be
; used in theories, etc.

; The fake runes are:

; *fake-rune-for-anonymous-enabled-rule*
; This fake rune is specially recognized by push-lemma and ignored.  Thus, if
; you wish to invent a rule that you don't wish to name or worry will be
; disabled, give the rule this :rune and the :nume nil.

; *fake-rune-for-linear*
; This fake rune is a signal that linear arithmetic was used.

; *fake-rune-for-type-set*
; This fake rune is used by type-set to record that built-in facts about
; primitive functions were used.

; *fake-rune-for-cert-data*
; This fake rune is a signal that information was used that was retrieved from
; either the first pass of an encapsulate or certify-book, or from the
; certificate of a certified book.

; WARNING: If more fake runes are added, deal with them in *fake-rune-alist*.

(defmacro base-symbol (rune)

; The "base symbol" of the rune (:token symbol . x) is symbol.

; Note: The existence of this function and the next one suggest that
; runes are implemented abstractly.  Ooooo... we don't know how runes
; are really laid out.  But this just isn't true.  We use car to get
; the token of a rune and we use cddr to get x, above.  But for some
; reason we defined and began to use base-symbol to get the base
; symbol.  In any case, if the structure of runes is changed, all
; mention of runes will have to be inspected.

(defun fnume (rune wrld)

; Rune has the shape of a rune.  We return its nume.  Actually, this function

; a fake rune as the name of some rule and wish to know its nume so they can

(defun rule-name-designatorp (x macro-aliases wrld)

; A rule name designator is an object which denotes a set of runes.  We call
; that set of runes the "runic interpretation" of the designator.  A rune, x,
; is a rule name designator, denoting {x}.  A symbol, x, with a
; 'runic-mapping-pairs property is a designator and denotes either
; {(:DEFINITION x)} or else the entire list of runes in the
; runic-mapping-pairs, depending on whether there is a :DEFINITION rune.  A
; symbol x that is a theory name is a designator and denotes the runic theory
; value.  Finally, a singleton list, (fn), is a designator if fn is a function
; symbol; it designates {(:EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART fn)}.

; For example, if APP is a function symbol then its runic interpretation is
; {(:DEFINITION APP)}.  If ASSOC-OF-APP is a defthm event with, say, three rule
; classes then its runic interpretation is a set of three runes, one for each
; rule generated.  The idea here is to maintain some consistency with the Nqthm
; way of disabling names.  If the user disables APP then only the symbolic
; definition is disabled, not the executable-counterpart, while if ASSOC-OF-APP
; is disabled, all such rules are disabled.

; When true, we return the symbol on which the set of rune is based.  This
; information, which involves the application of deref-macro-name, can be
; useful to callers; see check-theory-msg1.

; Note: We purposely do not define a function "runic-interpretation" which
; returns runic interpretation of a designator.  The reason is that we would
; have to cons that set up for every designator except theories.  The main
; reason we'd want such a function is to define the runic theory corresponding
; to a common one.  We do that below (in

; if an input theory is in fact a runic theory: if so, we need not sort it.

  (runic-theoryp1 nil lst wrld))

; When we start manipulating theories, e.g., unioning them together,
; we will actually first convert common theories into runic theories.
; We keep runic theories ordered so it is easier to intersect and
; union them.  However, this raises a slightly technical question,
; namely the inefficiency of repeatedly going to the property lists of
; the basic symbols of the runes to recover (by a search through the
; mapping pairs) the measures by which we compare runes (i.e., the
; numes).  We could order theories lexicographically -- there is no
; reason that theories have to be ordered by nume until it is time to
; load the enabled structure.  We could also obtain the measure of
; each rune and cons the two together into a mapping pair and sort
; that list on the cars.  This would at least save the repeated
; getprops at the cost of copying the list twice (once to pair the
; runes with their numes and once to strip out the final list of
; runes).

; We have compared these three schemes in a slightly simpler setting:
; sorting lists of symbols.  The sample list was the list of all event
; names in the initial world, i.e., every symbol in the initial world
; with an 'absolute-event-number property.  The lexicographic
; comparison was done with string<.  The measure (analogous to the
; nume) was the 'absolute-event-number.  We used exactly the same tail
; recursive merge routine used here, changing only the comparator
; expression.  The version that conses the nume to the rune before
; sorting paid the price of the initial and final copying.  The times
; to sort the 2585 symbols were:

; lexicographic:  1.29 seconds
; getprops:       1.18 seconds
; cars:           0.68 seconds

; We have decided to go the car route.  The argument that it does a
; lot of unnecessary consing is unpersuasive in light of the amount of
; consing done by sorting.  For example right off the bat in sort we
; divide the list into its evens and odds, thus effectively copying
; the entire list.  The point is that as it has always been coded,
; sort produces a lot of garbaged conses, so it is not as though
; copying the list twice is a gross insult to the garbage collector.

; We exhibit some performance measures of our actual theory manipulation
; functions later.  See Essay on Theory Manipulation Performance.

; Consider a runic theory.  We want to "augment" it by consing onto
; every rune its nume.  Common theories cannot be augmented until they
; are converted into runic ones.  Naively, then we want to consider two
; transformations: how to convert a common theory to a runic one, and
; how to augment a runic theory.  It turns out that the first
; transformation is messier than you'd think due to the possibility
; that distinct elements of the common theory designate duplicate
; runes.  More on this later.  But no matter what our final design, we
; need the second capability, since we expect that the theory
; manipulation functions will often be presented with runic theories.
; So we begin by augmentation of runic theories.

; Our goal is simply to replace each rune by its frunic-mapping-pair.
; But frunic-mapping-pair has to go to the property list of the basic
; symbol of the rune and then search through the 'runic-mapping-pairs
; for the pair needed.  But in a runic theory, it will often be the
; case that adjacent runes have the same symbol, e.g., (:REWRITE LEMMA
; . 1), (:REWRITE LEMMA . 2), ...  Furthermore, the second rune will
; occur downstream of the first in the 'runic-mapping-pairs of their
; basic symbol.  So by keeping track of where we found the last
; mapping pair we may be able to find the next one faster.

(defun find-mapping-pairs-tail1 (rune mapping-pairs)

; Rune is a rune and mapping-pairs is some tail of the
; 'runic-mapping-pairs property of its basic symbol.  Furthermore, we

  (cond ((null mapping-pairs)

; At one time we caused a hard error here, because we expected that this case
; never happens.  However, it can happen upon redefinition, when rune is no
; longer a rune.  Here are two examples.

; Example 1:
;   (defthm my-thm (equal (car (cons x x)) x))
;   (deftheory my-thy (current-theory :here))
;   (redef!)
;   (defthm my-thm (equal (cdr (cons x x)) x)

; As of October 2017 we believe that this code has been in place for many

; outweighed by avoiding presentation to users of this obscure error message.

; Terminology: Suppose x is some list of pairs and that the car of
; each pair is a rational.  We say x is a "measured list" because the
; measure of each element is given by the car of the element.  We
; consider two orderings of x.  The "parity t" ordering is that in

; that in which the cars of x are descending.  E.g., in the parity t
; ordering, the first element of x has the least car and the last
; element of x has the greatest.

; Let lst1 and lst2 be two measured lists.  This function merges lst1
; and lst2 to produce output in the specified parity.  However, it

; is ascending (parity = t) then the input must be descending (parity
; = nil).  This odd requirement allows us to do the merge in a tail

; We now develop the foundations of the concept that a rune is "enabled" in the

; runic theory corresponding to the current (common) theory and is said to be
; "disabled" otherwise.

; Historical Note about Nqthm

; Nqthm had no explicit notion of the current theory.  However, implicitly,
; nqthm contained a current theory and the events ENABLE and DISABLE allowed
; the user to add a name to it or delete a name from it.  The experimental
; xnqthm, mentioned elsewhere in this system, introduced the notion of theories
; and tied them to enabling and disabling, following suggestions and patches
; implemented by Bill Bevier during the Kit proofs (and implemented in
; Pc-Nqthm, and extended in Nqthm-1992).  The ACL2 notion of theory is much
; richer because it allows one to compute the value of theories using functions
; defined within the logic.  (end of note)

; Suppose we have a theory which has been selected as current.  This may be the
; globally current theory, as set by the in-theory event, or it may be a
; locally current theory, as set by the in-theory hint to defthm or defun.  We
; must somehow process the current theory so that we can quickly answer the
; question "is rune enabled?"  We now develop the code for doing that.

; The following invariant is maintained in all instances of this structure.
; Theory-array is an array1p whose array length is array-length.  Furthermore
; array-name is a symbol of the form rootj, root is the array-name-root (as a
; list of characters) and j is the array-name-suffix (which however is not
; always used; see load-theory-into-enabled-structure).  Thus, if i is a
; nonnegative integer less than array-length, then (acl2-aref1 array-name
; theory-array i) has a satisfied guard.  Furthermore, important to efficiency
; but irrelevant to correctness, it will always be the case that the von
; Neumann array associated with array-name is in fact theory-array.  Thus the
; above expression executes quickly.  To get a new array name, should one ever
; be needed, it can suffice to increment the array-name-suffix and build a name
; from that new value.  However, if we hope to use parallel evaluation in the
; waterfall, we instead make a unique name based on each clause-id.  See
; load-theory-into-enabled-structure.

; The theory-array of an enabled-structure for a given common theory is (except
; for the header entry) just the augmented runic theory corresponding to the
; given common theory.  That is, the ACL2 array alist we need to construct for
; a theory maps each array index to a non-nil value.  The non-nil value we
; choose is in fact the corresponding rune.  It would suffice, for purposes of
; enabling, to store T in the array to signify enabledness.  By storing the
; rune itself we make it possible to determine what runic theory is in the
; array.  (There is no general purpose way to map from a nume to its rune
; (short of looking through the whole world).)

; The global variable 'global-enabled-structure contains an instance of the
; enabled-structure record in which the array-name is ENABLED-ARRAY-0,
; array-name-root is the list of characters in "ENABLED-ARRAY-" and the
; array-name-suffix is 0.  A rune with nume n is (globally) enabled in the
; current world iff either n is greater than the index-of-last-enabling or
; array[n] is non-nil.  This is just the computation done by enabled-numep,
; below.

; The in-theory event loads the 'global-enabled-structure with the theory-value
; and sets the index-of-last-enabling to the maximum nume at that time.  This
; structure is passed into prove and thus into rewrite, etc.

; When an in-theory hint setting is provided we change the array name
; appropriately and load the local theory into that structure.  We flush each
; such array in order to allow it to be garbage collected; see
; restore-hint-settings-in-pspv.

; Historical Note about Nqthm

; In nqthm we solved this problem by having a list of temporarily disabled
; names which was bound when there were local enabling hint settings.  That
; implementation suffered because if hundreds of names were enabled locally the
; time spent searching the list was excessive.  In xnqthm we solved that
; problem by storing the enabled status on the property list of each name.  We
; could do that here.  However, that implementation suffered from the fact that
; if a proof attempt was aborted then we had to carefully clean up the property
; list structures so that they once again reflected the current (global)
; theory.  The beauty of the ACL2 approach is that local hint settings have no
; affect on the global theory and yet involve no overhead.

; A delicacy of the current implementation however concerns the relation
; between the global enabled structure and undoing.  If the world is backed up
; to some previous point, the 'global-enabled-structure extant there is exposed
; and we are apparently ready to roll.  However, the von Neumann array named by
; that structure may be out-dated in the sense that it contains a now undone
; theory.  Technically there is nothing wrong with this, but if we let it
; persist things would be very slow because the attempt to access the
; applicative array would detect that the von Neumann array is out of date and
; would result in a linear search of the applicative array.  We must therefore
; compress the applicative array (and hence reload the von Neumann one)
; whenever we back up.

; Finally, there is one last problem.  Eventually the array-size of the array
; in one of these structures will be too small.  This manifests itself when the
; maximum rule index at the time we load the structure is equal to or greater
; than the array-length.  At that time we grow the array size by 500.

; Here is how we use an enabled structure, ens, to determine if a nume, rune,
; or function is enabled.

; used, and flg is t iff term' is a quoted constant.  We avoid running disabled
; functions.  The flg result is probably not interesting to callers outside of
; this nest.

; This function's behavior on lambda applications is a little strange.
; Consider

; 1. ((lambda (x) (+ (+ 1 1) x)) 1)         ==> 3
; 2. ((lambda (x) (+ (+ 1 1) (undef x))) 1) ==> (+ 2 (undef 1))
; 3. ((lambda (x) (+ (+ 1 1) x)) a)         ==> ((lambda (x) (+ (+ 1 1) x)) a)

; Note: these examples are merely suggestive; binary-+ is a primitive and
; cons-term evaluates it.

; If the actuals to a lambda application are all constants, we take a chance
; and open up the lambda.  See example 1.  This will generally produce a
; constant.  But of course, that path through the lambda body may lead to
; constrained or disabled functions and then we'll get an expanded lambda, as
; in 2.  But if the actuals to the lambda are not all constants, we don't even
; try, as in 3.  This means that constant subexpressions inside the lambda body
; are still present, even though partial evaluation might lead even to a

; CLAUSE IDENTIFICATION

; Before we can write the function that prints a description of
; simplify-clause's output, we must be able to identify clauses.  This raises
; some issues that are more understandable later, namely, the notion of the
; pool.  See Section PUSH-CLAUSE and The Pool.

; Associated with every clause in the waterfall is a unique object
; called the clause identifier or clause-id.  These are printed out
; at the user in a certain form, e.g.,

; [3]Subgoal *2.1/5.7.9.11'''

; but the internal form of these ids is as follows.

(defrec clause-id

; Forcing-round is a natural number, pool-lst and case-lst are generally
; true-lists of non-zero naturals (though elements of case-lst can be of the
; form Dk in the case of a dijunctive split) and primes is a natural.  The
; pool-lst is indeed a pool-lst.  (See the function pool-lst.) The case-lst is

; clause-id.  Otherwise, incrmt-array-name-info is nil and we use the same
; name.  Loading consists of augmenting the theory (if augmented-p is nil) to
; convert it into a list of pairs, (nume . rune), mapping numes to their runes,
; and then compressing it into the named array.  We set the index of last
; enabling to be the highest existing nume in wrld right now unless
; index-of-last-enabling is non-nil, in which case we use that (which should be

; d, but the maximum index would be d-1, since indexing is 0-based.
; You set elements with (aset1 'name a i val).  That increases the
; length of a by 1.  When (length a) > m, a compress is done.  If an
; array is never modified, then the minimum acceptable m is in fact d.

(defun recompress-global-enabled-structure (varname wrld)

; Logically speaking this function is a no-op that returns t.  It is
; only called from #-acl2-loop-only code.  Practically speaking it
; side-effects the von Neumann array named in the global-enabled-
; structure so that it once again contains the current array.

; This function is called when you have reason to believe that the von
; Neumann array associated with the global enabled structure is out of
; date.  Suppose that wrld, above, was obtained from the then current
; ACL2 world by rolling back, as with UBT.  Then there is possibly a
; new 'global-enabled-structure in wrld.  But the array associated
; with it is still the one from the now-no-longer current ACL2 world.
; We just compress the new array again.  Because the array was already
; compressed, we know compress1 returns an eq object and so we don't
; actually have to store its value back into the global-enabled-structure.
; Indeed, we don't want to do that because it would require us to put a
; new binding of 'global-enabled-structure on wrld and we don't want to
; to do that.  (Once upon a time we did, and it was inconvenient because
; it covered up the most recent command-landmark; indeed, sometimes there
; would be two successive bindings of it.)

; Without the odd guard -- some term mentioning all the formals -- the formals
; are recognized as irrelevant!  This body below always returns t.

; Parallelism wart: it's unclear whether we need to lock this array operation.
; By design, each array and theory is unique to the current subgoal, so this
; locking should be unnecessary.  However, we've seen some slow array access
; warnings, and maybe this is where they're generated.

; We have defined all the basic concepts having to do with theories

; verbose theory checkers that ensure that a theory expression
; produced a theory, and the events for defining theories and setting
; the current one.  We do these things later and return now to the
; development of type-set.

; The Type-set-xxx Functions

; We are about to embark on a litany of definitions for determining
; the type-set of various function applications, given the type-sets
; of certain of their arguments.  There is no fixed style of
; definition here; because type-set is so often called, we thought it
; best to pass in only those arguments actually needed, rather than
; adhere to some standard style.  All of the functions return a type
; set and a ttree.  The ttree is always used as an accumulator in the
; sense that we may extend but may not ignore the incoming ttree.

; This raises a problem: Suppose that the ttree records our work in
; establishing the type set, ts, of an argument but that we ultimately
; ignore ts because it is not strong enough to help.  If we return the
; extended ttree, we might cause unnecessary case splits (justifying
; the irrelevant fact that the arg has type-set ts).  We adopt the
; convention of passing in two ttrees, named ttree and ttree0.  Ttree
; is always an extension of ttree0 and records the work done to get
; the argument type sets.  Therefore, we may return ttree (possibly
; extended) if our answer is based on the argument type sets, and may
; return ttree0 otherwise (which merely passes along unknown
; previously done work of any sort, not necessarily only work done on this
; particular term -- so do not return nil instead of ttree0!).

; The primitive type-set functions all push the following fake rune into the
; ttree they return, so that we know that primitive type-set knowledge was
; used.  Before we invented this fake rune, we attributed this type-set
; reasoning to propositional calculus, i.e., we would report that (implies
; (integerp x) (integerp (1- x))) was proved by trivial observations.  But we
; prefer to think of it (and report it) as type reasoning.  See the Essay on
; Fake-Runes for a discussion of fake runes.

; implement certain transformations on inequalities: When x is an

; (< -1 x) is (not (< x 0)).

; Warning: It is important to assume-true-false that type-set-< make
; these transformations.  See the comments about type-set-< in
; assume-true-false.

; As of Version_2.6, this function diverged even further from the standard

; of some simple inequalities which would be missed otherwise.

; Essay on the Recognizer-Alist and Recognizer-Tuples

; The "recognizer alist" of ACL2 is a combination of Nqthm's
; RECOGNIZER-ALIST and its two COMPOUND-RECOGNIZER-ALISTs.  The
; recognizer-alist is stored as a global variable in the world w and
; accessed via

; (global-val 'recognizer-alist w).

; The recognizer alist contains records of the following form:

(defrec recognizer-tuple

; Warning: In type-set-rec, we assume that the car of a recognizer-tuple cannot
; be the keyword :SKIP-LOOKUP.  Do not change the shape of this record to
; violate that assumption!  Visit all occurrences of :SKIP-LOOKUP if any such
; change is contemplated.

  (fn (nume . true-ts)
      (false-ts . strongp)
      . rune)
  t)

; The initial value of the recognizer alist is shown after we discuss the
; meaning of these records.

; In a recognizer-tuple, fn is the name of some Boolean-valued
; function of one argument.  True-ts and and false-ts are type sets.
; If such a record is on the recognizer-alist then it is the case that
; (fn x) implies that the type set of x is a subset of true-ts and
; (not (fn x)) implies that the type set of x is a subset of false-ts.
; Furthermore, if strongp is t, then true-ts is the complement of
; false-ts; i.e., (fn x) recognizes exactly the subset identified by
; true-ts.  Rune is either a rune or
; *fake-rune-for-anonymous-enabled-rule*.  Nume is the nume of rune
; (possibly nil).

; For example, if we prove that

; (BOOLEANP X) -> (OR (EQUAL X T) (EQUAL X NIL))

; then we can add the following tuple

; (make recognizer-tuple
;       :fn BOOLEANP
;       :true-ts *ts-boolean*
;       :false-ts *ts-unknown*
;       :strongp nil
;       :nume nil
;       :rune *fake-rune-for-anonymous-enabled-rule*)

; to the list.  Observe that the false-ts for this pair does not tell us
; much.  But if we proved the above AND

; (NOT (BOOLEANP X)) -> (NOT (OR (EQUAL X T) (EQUAL X NIL)))

; we could add the tuple:

; (make recognizer-tuple
;       :fn BOOLEANP
;       :true-ts *ts-boolean*
;       :false-ts (ts-complement *ts-boolean*)
;       :strongp t)

; And we would know as much about BOOLEANP as we know about integerp.

; Consider the function PRIMEP.  It implies its argument is a positive integer
; greater than 1.  Its negation tells us nothing about the type of its
; argument.

; (make recognizer-tuple
;       :fn PRIMEP
;       :true-ts *ts-integer>1*
;       :false-ts *ts-unknown*
;       :strongp nil)

; Suppose now x is a term whose type set we know.  What is the type set of
; (PRIMEP x)?  If the type set for x includes the integer>1 bit, the type set
; for (PRIMEP x) may include *ts-t* so we will throw that in.  If the type set
; for x includes any of *ts-unknown*'s bits (of course it does) we will throw
; in *ts-nil*.  The interesting thing about this is that if the type set of x
; does not include the integers>1 bit, we'll know (PRIME x) is nil.

; If we assume (PRIME x) true, we will restrict the type of x to the integers >
; 1.  If we assume (PRIME x) false, we won't restrict x at all.

; Consider the function RATTREEP that recognizes cons-trees of
; rational numbers.  We can prove that (RATTREEP x) implies the type
; set of x is in *ts-cons* union *ts-rational*.  We can prove that
; (NOT (RATTREEP x)) implies that the type set of x is not
; *ts-rational*.  That means the false-ts for RATTREEP is the
; complement of the rationals.  If we were asked to get the type set
; of (RATTREEP x) where x is rational, we'd throw in a *ts-t* because
; the type of x intersects the true-ts and we'd not throw in anything
; else (because the type of x does not intersect the false ts).  If
; we were asked to assume (RATTREEP x) then on the true branch x's
; type would be intersected with the conses and the rationals.  On
; the false branch, the rationals would be deleted.

; Historical Note: In an earlier version of this code we did not allow
; compound recognizer rules to be enabled or disabled and hence did
; not store the runes and numes.  We were much cleverer then
; about allowing newly proved rules to strengthen existing recognizer
; tuples.  That is, you could prove a rule about the true-ts and then
; a second about the false-ts, and then perhaps a third tightening up
; the true-ts fact a little, etc.  This had the problem that it was
; not possible to identify a single rule name with the known facts
; about the type of fn.  Thus, when we decided to track use of all
; rules it was impossible to give a sensible meaning to disabled
; compound recognizer rules in some cases.  (E.g., the fact stored
; might be derived from both enabled and disabled rules.)  So an
; important aspect of the new design is that there is a 1:1
; correspondence between what we know and the rule that told us.  If
; you have proved a sequence of three rules about fn we will use the
; most recently proved, still-enabled one.  If you disable that one,
; we'll naturally fall back on the next most recently still-enabled
; one.

; This function is supposed to determine the type set of (fn x) where

; Conversely, if arg-ts does not intersect with true-ts then (fn x)
; cannot possibly be true.  Exactly analogous statements can be made
; about false-ts.

; We return two results, the type set of (fn x) and an extension of

; Type Prescriptions

; A type-prescription is a structure, below, that describes how to
; compute the type of a term.  They are stored on the property list of
; the top function symbol of the term, under the property
; 'type-prescriptions.  Unlike Nqthm's "type-prescription-lst" ANY
; enabled type-prescription in 'type-prescriptions may contribute to
; the type-set of the associated function symbol.

(defrec type-prescription

; Warning: If you change this, consider changing conjoin-type-prescriptions.

            (hyps . backchain-limit-lst)
            (vars . rune)
            . corollary)
  t)

; Term is a term, hyps is a list of terms, basic-ts is a type-set, and vars is
; a list of variables that occur in term.  Let term' be some instance of term
; under the substitution sigma.  Then, provided the sigma instance of hyps is
; true, the type-set of term' is the union of basic-ts with the type-sets of
; the sigma images of the vars.  Corollary is the theorem (translated term)
; from which this type-prescription was derived.  For system-generated
; type-prescriptions it is a term created by convert-type-prescription-to-term.
; Backchain-limit-lst must either be nil, or else a list containing only nil
; and natural numbers, of the same length as hyps.

; (Note: Why do we store the corollary when we could apparently recompute it
; with convert-type-prescription-to-term?  The reason is that the computation
; is sensitive to the ens in use and we do not wish the corollary for a
; type-prescription rule to change as the user changes the global enabled
; structure.)

; For example, for APP we might have the type-prescription:

; (make type-prescription :rune ... :nume ...
;       :term (app x y)
;       :hyps ((true-listp x))
;       :basic-ts *ts-cons*
;       :vars '(y)
;       :corollary (implies (true-listp x)
;                           (if (consp (app x y))
;                               't
;                               (equal (app x y) y))))

; The above example corresponds to what we'd get from the lemma:
; (implies (true-listp x)
;          (or (consp (app x y))
;              (equal (app x y) y)))

; Warning: All functions listed above must be defun'd non-recursively
; before deftheory definition-minimal-theory!

; There has been some thought about whether we should put IFF on this
; list.  We have decided not, because type-set knows a lot about it by
; virtue of its being an equivalence relation.  But this position has
; never been seriously scrutinized.

; In a break with nqthm, we have decided to let type-set expand some
; function applications to get better type-sets for them.  The
; functions in question are those listed above.

; In an even more pervasive break, we have decided to make type-set
; keep track of the dependencies between literals of the goal clause
; and the type-sets computed.  The ttree argument to type-set below is
; a running accumulator that is returned as the second value of
; type-set.  Among the tags in the ttree are 'pt tags.  The value of
; the tag is a "parent tree" indicating the set of literals of the
; current-clause upon which the type deduction depends.  See the Essay
; on Parent Trees.  The type-alist in general contains entries of the
; form (term ts . ttree), where ttree is the tag-tree encoding all of
; the 'PTs upon which depend the assertion that term has type-set ts.

; Note on Performance:

; An early time trial detected no measurable difference between the
; old type-set and the new when the ttree is t.  This was on a
; collection of simple defuns and thms (flatten, mc-flatten, their
; relation, and a guarded defun of (assoc-eq2 x y alist) where alist
; is a true list of triples of the form (sym1 sym2 . val)) that
; required a total of 15 seconds run-time in both versions.  However,
; because the only available "old" ACL2 is the first release, which
; does not have all of the proof techniques in place, and the new
; system does have them in place, it is difficult to make meaningful
; tests.  To make matters worse, we are about to go implement forward
; chaining.  The bottom line is whether ACL2 is fast enough.  We'll
; see...

; We now continue with the development of type-set.

(defun mv-atf (not-flg mbt mbf tta fta ttree1 ttree2)

; (mv mbt mbf tta fta (cons-tag-trees ttree1 ttree2)).

; This is incorrect on two counts.  First, if not-flg is true, we swap
; the roles of mbt/mbf and tta/fta.  Second, since the ttree result of
; assume-true-false is irrelevant unless mbt or mbf is t, we sometimes
; produce a nil ttree.

; The reason this function takes two ttrees is that many (but not all)
; paths through assume-true-false have two ttrees in hand at the end.
; One is the ``xttree'' arg of assume-true-false, which was to be
; included in all the ttrees generated by the function.  The other is
; some local ttree that describes the derivation of facts during
; assume-true-false.  We could combine these two trees before calling
; mv-atf but that would, possibly, waste a cons since the ttrees are
; sometimes ignored.

; Finally, because we know that the ttrees are ignored when mbt and
; mbf are both nil, we sometimes pass in nil for the two ttrees in
; calls of mv-atf where we know they will be ignored.  Such a call
; should be taken (by the reader) as a clear signal that the ttrees

; Term is a quotep.  This function returns (mv pat1 term1 pat2 term2) as
; follows.  If pat1 is t then pat/s = term for every substitution s, where here
; and below, = denotes provable equality (in other words, it is a theorem in
; the given context that pat = term).  If pat1 is nil then there are no
; requirements.  Otherwise pat1 and term1 are terms and the spec is as follows.
; If pat2 is nil then for every substitution s, pat/s = term if pat1/s = term1.
; But if pat2 is non-nil; then pat2 and term2 are terms, and pat/s = term/s if
; both pat1/s = term1/s and pat2/s = term2/s.

; Thus, this function allows us to reduce the problem of matching pat to a
; quotep, term, to one or two matching problems for "parts" of pat and term.

; In order to prevent loops, we insist that one-way-unification does not

; Essay on the Invariants on Type-alists, and Canonicality

; There are four invariants on type-alists.

; First invariant on type-alists:  No quotep is bound in a type-alist.

; Second invariant on type-alists:  when (equiv x y) is bound in a type-alist,
; it is bound to a type of *ts-t* or *ts-nil*.

; Unlike the first two invariants, we will not depend on the third and fourth
; for soundness.  We'll present them in a moment.  We will maintain them both
; by insisting that the only operations allowed for extending type-alists are
; extend-type-alist-simple, extend-type-alist, extend-type-alist1, and
; extend-type-alist-with-bindings, and zip-variable-type-alist, called in
; accordance with their guards.

; Definition.  We say that a term u is "canonical" for an equivalence relation
; equiv of the current ACL2 world and a type-alist if no entry in type-alist is
; of the form ((equiv u z) *ts-t* . ttree).  When equiv and type-alist are
; understood, we may say simply that u is canonical.

; Third invariant on type-alists: For every element ((equiv x y) ts . ttree) of
; a type-alist for which equiv is an equivalence relation in the current ACL2
; world, y is canonical.  Moreover, if ts is *ts-nil*, then x is also
; canonical; and, if ts is *ts-t*, then (term-order y x) and x is not y.
; Finally, for each x there is at most one entry in type-alist of the form
; ((equiv x y) *ts-t* . ttree); in this case, or when x = y and there is no
; entry of the form ((equiv y y') *ts-t* . ttree), we say that y is the
; canonical form of x.

; Although we have decided to maintain the third invariant, if later we decide
; not to be insistent on that, we may obtain some speed-up by replacing some
; calls of extend-type-alist by extend-type-alist-simple.  Look for the string
; ";;*** -simple" to see some places where that might be especially
; appropriate.  Note that even extend-type-alist-simple is careful to preserve
; the first two invariants.

; The fourth invariant on type-alists:  No term is ever bound to *ts-unknown*.

(defun canonical-representative (equiv term type-alist)

; This function returns a tuple (mv occursp canonicalp term-canon ttree)
; satisfying the following description.

; Occursp holds iff, for some x, (equiv term x) or (equiv x term) is bound in
; type-alist.

; Canonicalp is t or nil, and it is t iff term is canonical (see Essay above).

; Term-canon is the canonical form of term, i.e., is term if canonicalp is t
; and otherwise is the unique x such that ((equiv term x) *ts-t* . tt) belongs
; to type-alist for some tt.

; Ttree is a tag-tree justifying the equality of term to term-canon.

; We will use the following easy-to-prove theorem:

; (occursp = nil)
;   implies
; (canonicalp = t)
;   which implies
; (term-canon = term)

; We will also use the fact that if canonicalp is t then ttree is nil.

; Term1 is worse-than-builtin term2 if it is basic-worse-than term2 or some
; proper subterm of it is worse-than-builtin or equal to term2.  However, we
; know that if two terms are pseudo-variants of each other, then the
; worse-than-builtin relation does not hold.

; This use of a clocked function is new after Version_7.0.  Our investigations
; into the worse-than heuristic after that release began with an email from
; Camm Maguire on Jan. 21, 2015, pointing out that books/coi/dtrees/base.lisp
; was the only book that required more than 2G memory for certification using
; ACL2(h) 7.0 built on 64-bit GCL.  We found the memoization of
; worse-than-builtin was the culprit.  An email discussion with Jared Davis
; included his suggestion of a clocked version, rather like this one, that
; avoided the use of memoization until reaching a sufficient recursion depth.
; It occurred to us that with a clocked version, perhaps memoization could be
; avoided entirely, possibly saving memory and leading to a simpler, arguably
; more predictable implementation.  Comments below explore these options.

; We did a number of experiments in late January, 2015, after the release of
; Version_7.0.  Major results are reported below.  In short, all three
; approaches improved the performance, with differences perhaps in the noise.
; It was a close call, but we decided against (3) since its added complexity
; and possible memory usage didn't seem to provide non-trivial value, and we
; decided on (1) over (2) because (1) had less risk of destroying existing
; proofs (albeit with the risk that, unlike (2), some proofs might loop that
; otherwise would not because of a weaker ancestors-check.

; All results below used the same unloaded machine/platform (64-bit Linux,
; 3.5 GHz 4-core Intel(R) Xeon(R) with Hyper-Threading), with a command like
; the following.

; Essay on Type-set Deductions for Integerp

; Robert Krug found it disturbing that ACL2 could not make certain type-set
; deductions about whether terms are definitely integers or are definitely not
; integers.  Version_3.2.1 and beyond contains code descended from a
; contribution from Robert (included below through type-set-finish) that
; rectifies this problem, which is illustrated by examples contributed by
; Robert, in community book books/misc/integer-type-set-test.lisp.

; Here is an outline of the issue.  Suppose we have:

; Term to type:
; y  = a+bx   [a and b numeric constants]

; Now suppose we find the following in the type-alist:

; Term typed as definitely integer or definitely not integer:
; y' = a'+b'x [a' constant, b' a non-zero numeric constant]

; Then note:

; y = (a - (ba'/b')) + (b/b')y'.

; Let C = (a - Da') where D = b/b'; so

; y = C + Dy' [where C and D are known to be numeric].

; We can prove the following in order to justify the claim just above:

; (include-book "arithmetic/top" :dir :system)
; (thm (implies (and (equal y (+ a (* b x)))
;                    (equal y2 (+ a2 (* b2 x)))
;                    (acl2-numberp b2) (not (equal b2 0)))
;               (let* ((d (/ b b2))
;                      (c (- a (* d a2))))
;                 (equal y (+ c (* d y2))))))

; Then we can, of course, potentially strengthen the type known for y by using
; the above alternate form of y, combining in a suitable manner the known types
; of y', C, and D.

; The description above is slightly simplistic, however.  Suppose for example
; that y above is 2 + 4u + 6v, while y' is 7 + 10u + 15v.  Then in fact we can
; view y and y' as follows.

; y  = 2 +  4(u + 3/2 v)
; y' = 7 + 10(u + 3/2 v)

; The representation of a term as having the form a+bx is performed by function
; normalize-linear-sum.

; Robert informs us that he tried an analogous enhancement in which one tries
; to decide rationalp propositions in addition to integerp propositions, but he
; found that to be exceedingly expensive.

; We now develop the code for normalize-linear-sum and then the code for
; type-set-finish-1.  The sorting done by normalize-linear-sum-2 was added
; after Version_4.3; an example in normalize-linear-sum illustrates what that
; adds.

; term = 'additive-constant + 'multiplicative-constant * normalized-term,

; where additive-constant and multiplicative-constant are rational numbers
; (not quoted) and normalized-term has a leading coefficient of 1 or 0.  We
; intend it to be 1, but there is not much we can do with (+ 3 (* 0 x)).
;
; Pseudo examples:
; (foo x) ==> (mv 0 1 (foo x))
; (- (foo x)) ==> (mv 0 -1 (foo x))
; (+ x y) ==> (mv 0 1 (+ x y))
; (+ (* 3 x) y) ==> (mv 0 3 (+ x (* 1/3 y)))
; (+ 2 (* 3 x) y) ==> (mv 2 3 (+ x (* 1/3 y)))
;
; Note that for best results, sums and products must be right-associated with
; the addends/factors in term order (or at least with constants all the way to
; the left), and terms such as (- (* 3 ...)) do not appear.  (* -3 ...) is the
; preferred form.  Robert Krug underwent a process to accommodate terms that do
; not satisfy these assumptions, but he tells us that the code rapidly became
; unwieldy and he found no natural stopping point for that process.

; For example, if typ is *ts-rational* then we seek an instance of
; term that is known to be a subset of the rationals.  Most commonly,
; typ is *ts-non-nil*.  In that case, we seek an instance of term
; that is non-nil.  Thus, this function can be thought of as trying to
; "make term true."  To use this function to "make term false," use
; the ts-complement of the desired type.  I.e., if you wish to find a
; false instance of term use *ts-nil*.

; By "instance" here we always mean an instance under an extension of
; unify-subst.  The extension is returned when we are successful.

; We return three values.  The first indicates whether we succeeded.
; The second is the final unify-subst.  The third is a modified ttree
; recording the literals used.  If we did not succeed, the second
; and third values are our input unify-subst and ttree.  I.e., we are
; a No-Change Loser.

; The No-Change Policy:  Many multi-valued functions here return a
; flag that indicates whether they "won" or "lost" and, in the case
; that they won, return "new values" for certain of their arguments.
; Here for example, we return a new value for unify-subst.  In early
; coding we adopted the policy that when they "lost" the additional
; values were irrelevant and were often nil.  This policy prevented
; the use of such forms as:
; (mv-let (wonp unify-subst)
;         (search-type-alist ... unify-subst ...)
;         (cond (wonp ...)
;               (t otherwise...)))
; because at otherwise... unify-subst was no longer what it had been before
; the search-type-alist.  Instead we had to think of a new name for
; it in the mv-let and use the appropriate one below.

; We then adopted what we now call the "No-Change Policy".  If a
; function returns a won/lost flag and some altered arguments, the
; No-Change Policy is that it returns its input arguments in case it
; loses.  We will note explicitly when a function is a No-Change
; Loser.

; The Accumulated Persistence Essay

; We now develop the code needed to track accumulated-persistence.  The
; documentation topic for accumulated-persistence serves as a useful
; introduction to what is implemented by the code, and is a good starting point
; before reading this Essay.

; A typical use of this utility is as follows.

; >(accumulated-persistence t)              ; activate and initialize
; > ...                                     ; do proofs
; >(show-accumulated-persistence :frames)   ; to display stats ordered by
;                                           ;  frame count
; >(accumulated-persistence nil)            ; deactivate

; A macro form is available for use in system code to support the tracking of
; accumulated persistence.  The special-form

; (with-accumulated-persistence rune (v1 ... vk) body)

; should be used in our source code whenever body is code that attempts to
; apply rune.  The list of variables, (v1 ... vk), tell us the multiplicity
; of body.  This form is logically equivalent to

; (mv-let (v1 ... vk) body (mv v1 ... vk))

; which is to say, it is logically equivalent to body itself.  (In the case
; where k is 1, we naturally use a let instead of an mv-let.)  However, we
; insert some additional code to accumulate the persistence of rune.

; There are optional arguments of with-accumulated-persistence not described in
; this essay, but whose meaning is pretty clear from the code.

; The implementation of accumulated-persistence is as follows.  First, the
; necessary global data structures are maintained as the status of a wormhole
; called 'accumulated-persistence.  As usual with a wormhole status, it is of
; the form (:key . data), where :key is either :SKIP or :ENTER indicating
; whether wormhole is supposed to actually enter the wormhole.  The data itself
; is an accp-info record.  The record stores success (useful work) and failure
; (useless work) counts, success and failure stacks, and totals, as follows.
; Conceptually, there is always a current stack for lemmas other than the one
; currently being applied (after push-accp but before pop-accp).  The stack is
; initially empty, but every attempt to apply a lemma (with push-accp) pushes
; current information on the stack and starts accumulating information for that
; lemma, generally while relieving hypotheses.  More precisely, all our data is
; kept in a single accp-info record, which is the value of the wormhole-data
; field of wormhole-status:

; If accumulated persistence is enabled then we give special treatment to
; hypotheses and conclusions of rules.  Each is represented as an ``extended
; rune'' (``xrune''), which provides an accumulation site for work done on
; behalf of that hypothesis or conclusion.  Thus, we actually traffic in
; xrunes, where an xrune is either a rune, a hyp-xrune (:hyp rune , n) where n
; is a positive integer, or a conc-xrune (:conc . rune).  The hyp-xrune (:hyp
; rune . n) is used in accumulated-persistence for recording the work done on
; behalf of the nth hypothesis of rune, while the conc-xrune (:conc . rune)
; records the work done on behalf of the right-hand-side of the rune.  Note
; that :doc accumulated-persistence says that a hyp-xrune is (:hyp n . rune)
; rather than (:hyp rune . n), but we found the latter form much more
; convenient for sorting.  Still, we present (:hyp n . rune) to the user by
; calling prettyify-xrune.

; Cnt-s is the total number of lemmas tried that have led to a successful

; Cnt-f is similar but for lemmas whose application failed (typically because a
; hypothesis was not relieved).

; Stack-s (resp. stack-f) is a stack of old values of cnt-s (resp. cnt-f).

; Xrune-stack is a list of xrunes corresponding to stack-s and stack-f, where
; each xrune corresponds to a call of push-accp made on behalf of that xrune.

; Xrunep is true if we are to collect information for hypothesis and conclusion
; xrunes, and is nil otherwise.

; Totals is a stack of the accumulated totals, initially '(nil); it is one
; longer than the common length of stack-s and stack-f.  Each element of the
; stack is a list associating xrunes with totals accumulated for a
; corresponding xrune (i.e., an ancestral call of push-accp), as follows.

(defrec accp-entry

; Warning.  We construct lists of such entries that we refer to as alists.
; Before changing the shape of this record, consider whether we are relying on
; it being a record whose car is its :xrune field.  See for example
; sort-xrune-alist-by-rune1.

; Each element of stack-s (resp. stack-f) corresponds to an attempt to apply a
; certain xrune and the element is the value of cnt-s (resp. cnt-f) at the time
; the attempt started.  When the attempt is successful, we increase cnt-s,
; first by one if we have a rune rather than a hyp-xrune or conc-xrune, and
; then by the difference of the current value of cnt-s with the old value (on
; top of stack-s) to find out how many lemmas were usefully tried under that
; xrune, and we accumulate that difference into the success fields of the
; current totals for that xrune; similarly for cnt-f and useless tries.  When
; the attempt fails, all accumulation is into the failure (useless) fields of
; the totals.  The accumulated totals is a stack of lists, each of which
; contains elements associating xrunes with values n-s, ap-s, n-f, and ap-f,
; where n-s is the number of times xrune was pushed onto the stack and
; successfully applied, ap-s is the accumulated persistence of useful
; applications of that xrune (the total number of applications while that xrune
; was on the stack, not yet including such applications that are recorded in
; more recent stack frames), and n-f and ap-f are similar but for failed
; applications of that xrune.

; Performance: We have seen (Version_3.2.1) about a 50% increase in time with

(defun assume-true-false-<

; This function returns an extended type-alist by assuming (< ts1 ts2) true if
; not-flg is nil, but assuming (< ts1 ts2) false if not-flg is not nil.  It
; assumes that type-set (and hence type-set-<) was not able to decide the truth
; or falsity of (< ts1 ts2).  We could put this code in-line in
; assume-true-false, but the `true-type-alist' and `false-type-alist' are dealt
; with symmetrically, so it's convenient to share code via this function.

; Here are the cases we handle.  In this sketch we are glib about the
; possibility that arg1 or arg2 is nonnumeric or complex, but our code handles
; the more general situation.

; When we assume (< arg1 arg2) true,
; * if arg1 is positive then arg2 is positive
; * if arg1 is in the nonnegatives then arg2 is strictly positive
; * if arg2 is in the nonpositives then arg1 is strictly negative
; When we say "arg1 is in the nonnegatives" we mean to include the
; case where arg1 is strictly positive.  Note also that if arg1 may be
; negative, then arg2 could be anything (given that we've made the
; normalization for integers above).  Thus, the above two cases are as
; strong as we can be.

; When we assume (< arg1 arg2) false we find it easier to think about
; assuming (<= arg2 arg1) true:
; * if arg1 is negative, then arg2 is negative
; * if arg1 is nonpositive, then arg2 is nonpositive
; * if arg2 is nonnegative, then arg1 is nonnegative
; Note that if arg1 may be positive then arg2 could be anything, so
; there are no other cases we can express.

; The test says: We are dealing with (< arg1 arg2) where arg1 is non-negative
; or a non-number.  We are thus allowed to deduce that arg2 is strictly
; positive or complex.  That is, we may delete the non-positive reals
; and non-numbers from its existing type-set.  If that doesn't change
; anything, we don't want to do it, so we have the third conjunct above that
; says arg2 contains some non-positive reals or some non-numbers.

; A worry is that the intersection below is empty.  Can that happen?  If it
; did, then we would have that arg1 is a non-negative real or a non-number,
; and arg2 is a non-positive real or a non-number.  Supposedly type-set-<
; would have then reported that (< arg1 arg2) must be false and mbf would be t.
; So the empty intersection cannot arise.

; X is a term and type-alist is a type alist mapping terms to their type-sets
; (and some ttrees) and thus encoding the current assumptions.  In a break with
; nqthm, the ACL2 type-set function tracks dependencies among the entries on
; the type-alist.  In particular, the type-alist here contains pairs of the
; form (term ts . ttree), where ttree is a tag-tree generally containing 'PT
; tags.  (There may be other tags, e.g., 'LEMMA and maybe even 'FC-DERIVATION
; during forward- chaining.)  In nqthm, the type-alist contained pairs of the
; form (term . ts).  The ttree argument to type-set is an accumulator onto
; which we add all of the ttrees attached to the facts we use from the
; type-alist and the wrld.  We return two results, the final type set of term
; and a ttree.

; Note:  If ancestors is t it means:  don't backchain.  Act as though
; the literal we're backchaining on is worse than everything in sight.
; This is called the ``t-ancestors hack'' and is commented upon below.

; Performance Notes:

; Type set was first made to track dependencies -- after a fashion --
; during the coding of forward chaining in April, 1990.  At that time,
; type-set had an option under which it would not track dependencies
; and that option was often used in rewrite; indeed, the only time
; dependencies were tracked was during setting up of the type-alist
; and forward chaining activations in simplify-clause.  In addition,
; compound recognizer lemmas were never tracked.  The paragraph below
; was written of that version of a ``dependency tracking'' type-set.

; Experiments show that (at the time of this writing) this type-set is
; roughly 30% slower than the type-set ACL2 had immediately before
; this addition.  That data was obtained by collecting roughly 70,000
; external calls of type-set that occurred during the proof that
; TAUTOLOGYP is sound and then timing their re-evaluation in both
; versions of ACL2 (with appropriate modifications of the type-alists
; being passed in).  That same experiment led to the surprising fact
; that type set may represent 50-75% of the time spent in the prover!

; We have since added full dependency tracking to type-set and have
; adopted the invariants on type-alist requiring canonical forms.  How
; much these changes slow things down is anyone's guess.  Stay tuned.

; The DWP flag
; or
; Performance Notes on the "Type-Set Objective" Idea and Double Whammy

; "DWP" stands for "double whammy flag".  It does not affect the
; soundness of the result returned but, when t, makes type-set "try
; harder" to get a narrow type.  It was added Feb 7, 1995 and replaces
; a heuristic hack controlling the "double whammy" idea.  The
; historical comment below explains.

; I have tried an experiment in which type-set gets the type of x in
; two ways and intersects them.  The first way is to look x up on the
; type-alist.  The second way is to compute it from scratch.  Call
; this the "double whammy" approach.  Double whammy is the simplest
; case of a more sophisticated type-set that computes a type for x
; relative to some specified "expected type."  The idea of that design
; was to have the caller of type-set supply the type it wanted x to
; have and type-set then did a double whammy if the type-alist type
; wasn't a subset of the expected type.  But that "conditional double
; whammy" idea is hard to implement.  For example, suppose you want (-
; a) to have a type-set of non-negative rational.  Then when you get
; the type-set of a you should want it to have type non-positive
; rational.  Rather than implement that fine tuned use of the expected
; type-set, I decided simply to implement the double whammy method,
; i.e., always using both ways and intersecting the results.  To my
; surprise, the double whammy method is 3 times slower than the
; ordinary type-set.  That number was obtained by running nqthm.lisp,
; which ordinarily takes 3460 seconds but which takes 10300 seconds
; under double whammy.  I then backed off the full blown double whammy
; and limited its use to the special case where (a) the type-set
; computed from the type-alist is negative and (b) forcing is allowed.
; Under these two cases, type-set is about 6% slower than without any
; double whammy processing.

; Why these two cases?  Here is the rationale I had, for what it is
; worth.  Condition (a) often indicates the type was "non-nil" or
; "anything but a negative", as when you assume (< 0 a) without
; knowing a is rational.  Presumably, forcing was disallowed when this
; negative binding was created, since we probably have forced
; hypotheses around to ensure that the guards are met.  Therefore, if
; condition (b) is also met, the chances are good that a "from
; scratch" computation will force now and we'll get a better answer.

; The hit rate even with these restrictions is quite unimpressive:
; double whammy changes the looked up type in only 1% of the cases
; where we try it!  Of the roughly 4.4 million calls of type-set in
; the nqthm.lisp proofs, 39% of them (1.7 million) find a binding on
; the type-alist and therefore check conditions (a) and (b).  In
; roughly 90% of the those cases, either the found type-set is
; negative or forcing is disallowed and so double whammy is not used.
; In only 176000 calls is double whammy even tried.  That is only 4%
; of the total number of type-set calls.  But of those 176000 attempts
; to use double whammy, in only 2254 cases did it help.  That's a 1%
; hit rate on double whammy.  Not really impressive.  However, one of
; those hits is the case that Bishop reported we couldn't prove and
; now we can.  That example is given below just for future reference.

; The problem is that (foo '(1 . 1)) is given the type-set
; non-negative anything when we construct the type-alist for the
; linear pot, because we do not force the (bar-p '(1 . 1)).  But
; later, when we are in linear we ask whether (foo '(1 . 1)) is an
; integer and, because of double whammy, force the previously unforced
; bar-p.

; Thus ends the historical comment.  Below, where (not dwp) is tested,
; we used to test
; (or (null force-flg)            ;;;(b)
;     (>= (the-type-set ts0) 0))  ;;;(a)

; This heuristic control on when to double whammy is thwarted by the
; example below.  Consider the clause shown below.  It ought to be
; decidable by type-set alone because if i is an integerp then (binary-+ '1 i)
; is too.  But the "irrelevant" hypothesis that (binary-+ '1 i) is a rationalp
; messes things up.  Let 1+i stand for the binary-+ expression.

; (type-alist-clause '((not (rationalp (binary-+ '1 i)))  ; lit 1
;                      (not (integerp i))                 ; lit 2
;                      (integerp (binary-+ '1 i)))        ; lit 3
;                     nil nil nil (ens state) (w state))

; We process lit 3 in a type-alist generated by assuming lits 1 and 2
; false.  In that type-alist, 1+i is assumed rational and i is assumed
; integral.  When we process lit 3, we get the type of 1+i.  Because of
; lit 1, we find it on the type-alist with rational type.  Because the
; type is non-negative we do not double whammy.  Thus, we miss the
; chance to use lit 2 in computing the type of 1+i.  We thus return a
; type-alist in which 1+i is assumed to be a ratio (non-integer
; rational) and i is integral.

; However, by arranging for assume-true-false always to call type-set
; with dwp = t, we make it use double whammy when assuming things.
; That allows us to catch this.  Our hope is that it does not slow us

; Afterwards, we swept the ttree and appropriately instantiated the forced

; had to instantiate the :type-alists too.  Rather than do so, we abandoned

; Hyps is a list of terms, implicitly conjoined.  Alist is a substitution
; mapping variables in hyps to terms governed by type-alist.  Consider the
; result, hyps', of substituting alist into each hyp in hyps.  We wish to know
; whether, by type-set reasoning alone, we can get that hyps' are all true in
; the context of type-alist.  We do the substitution one hyp at a time, so we
; don't pay the price of consing up instances beyond the first hyp that fails.
; While we are at it, we record in an extension of type-alist the type computed
; for each hyp', so that if subsequent rules need that information, they can
; get it quickly.

; No Change Loser for ttree, but not for type-alist.

; Mini-Essay on Assume-true-false-if and Implies
; or
; How Strengthening One Part of a Theorem Prover Can Weaken the Whole.

; Normally, when ACL2 rewrites one of the branches of an IF expression,
; it ``knows'' the truth or falsity (as appropriate) of the test.  More
; precisely, if x is a term of the form (IF test true-branch false-branch),
; when ACL2 rewrites true-branch, it can determine that test is true by
; type reasoning alone, and when it rewrites false-branch it can determine
; that test is false by type reasoning alone.  This is certainly what one
; would expect.

; However, previously, if test was such that it would print as (AND
; test1 test2) -- so that x would print as (IF (AND test1 test2)
; true-branch false-branch) -- when ACL2 rewrote true-branch it only
; knew that (AND test1 test2) was true --- it did not know that test1
; was true nor that test2 was true, but only that their conjunction
; was true.  There were also other situations in which ACL2's
; reasoning was weak about the test of an IF expression.

; The function assume-true-false-if was written to correct this problem
; but it caused other problems of its own.  This mini-essay records
; one of the difficulties encountered and its solution.

; In initial tests with the new assume-true-false-if, more than three-
; fourths of the community books failed to certify.  Upon
; examination it turned out that ACL2 was throwing away many of the
; :use hints as well as some of the results from generalization
; rules.  Let us look at a particular example (from inequalities.lisp
; in the arithmetic library):

;;; (defthm <-*-right-cancel
;;;   (implies (and (rationalp x)
;;;                 (rationalp y)

;;;                 (cond

;;;                  ((equal z 0)
;;;                   nil)

; was true.  But it would not know, for instance, that
; (< '0 (ABS (BINARY-+ Y (UNARY-- X)))) was true.

; With the introduction of assume-true-false-if, however, ACL2 would
; know that each element of the conjunction represented by the IF
; expression was true, and so would be able to determine that the
; conclusion of the :use hint was true by type-reasoning alone (since
; the original :theorem was so proved).  Thus, the whole hint rewrites
; to true and is removed.  Bummer.

; Previously, the conclusion of a :use hint or of a fact derived from
; a generalization rule would, in affect, be rewritten (the first
; time) under the type-alist of the overall goal to be proved.  We now
; handle IMPLIES differently in order to return to this original
; behavior.

; The basic idea is not to expand IMPLIES except within rewrite where
; we can easily maintain the proper type-alists.  Two simple exceptions
; to this rule are in tautologyp and distribute-first-if.  We expand
; IMPLIES within tautologyp for obvious reasons and within distribute-
; first-if because earlier tests (presumably still valid) showed that
; this was both faster and more fruitful.  Note that this second
; exception implies that an IMPLIES will never show up due to a user
; defined function.

; A slightly more subtle exception is in preprocess-clause where we
; expand an IMPLIES if it is derived from the original theorem to be
; proved.  This is necessary to provide a context for rewrite (See the
; comments in preprocess-clause beginning ``Note: Once upon a time (in
; Version 1.5)'' for more on this.

;; Historical Comment from Ruben Gamboa:
;; In this function, I relaxed the tests for rational to include
;; realp as well.

; X is an IF-expression we have been asked to assume-true-false.  We

; The original motivation for this function lay in the fact that, within

; (IF a b 'nil) which is the translation of (AND a b).  This function
; then ensures that the truth of both a and b are recorded in the
; true-type-alist returned.  It is, however, written to handle the
; general case.

; ``if'' expressions in the calls of extend-with-proper/improper-cons-ts-tuple
; below: it determines whether we add the arg restriction to type-alist itself
; or to an extension of type-alist that restricts (recog arg) appropriately.
; The assumption that (recog arg) is true depends both on xttree (by contract)
; and the rune, since we are exploiting the fact that recog is Boolean.  The
; assumption that (recog arg) is false only depends on xttree.

; conjuncts.  But we have put in the occursp1 conjuncts just in order to gain,

; Essay on Strong Handling of *ts-one*

; We are considering a type-alist extension based on (not (equal TM C)) where
; the type-set of C is in *singleton-type-sets*.  The basic idea is to assign a
; type-set to TM by removing the type-set bit for C from what would otherwise
; be the type-set of TM.  In April 2016 we extended the singleton type-sets
; to include *ts-one*.  The question arose: Do we really want to give this
; special treatment to *ts-one*?  Let us call that the "strong handling of
; *ts-one*".

; We considered avoiding such strong handling of *ts-one*, thus saving us from
; numerous regression failures.  For example, consider the lemma
; explode-nonnegative-integer-of-positive-is-not-zero-list in community book
; books/std/io/base.lisp.  If the tests below are simply (member ts2
; *singleton-type-sets*) and (member ts1 *singleton-type-sets*), then that
; proof fails.  However, the proof then once again succeeds if first we modify
; linearize1 so that its type-set calls are made with dwp = t.  That change
; seems potentially expensive, and perhaps could cause many existing books
; (some outside the community books) to fail.  We believe that the reason dwp =
; t is necessary in this example, assuming strong handling of *ts-one*, is that
; assume-true-false-rec produces a false-type-alist by assigning TM to a
; type-set TS with *ts-one* removed, where TM otherwise is not assigned in the
; false-type-alist.  Thus, linearize1 finds the type-set TS for TM, and with
; dwp = nil it fails to find a stronger type that it would have found if TM had
; not been assigned on that type-alist.

; We therefore tried to avoid all strong handling of *ts-one*.  Unfortunately,
; as Jared Davis pointed out, the rule bitp-compound-recognizer then had a weak
; type-set: specifically, the :false-ts for the corresponding recognizer-tuple
; was (ts-complement *ts-zero*) instead of (ts-complement *ts-bit*).

; Our solution attempts to address both of these cases.  We allow strong
; handling of *ts-one* when TM is a variable, which allows the rule
; bitp-compound-recognizer to be given the desired :false-ts.  Note that if TM
; is a variable then the above discussion about dwp = t is probably much less
; relevant, since no type-prescription rule will apply to TM.  However, even if
; TM is not a variable, we provide strong handling of *ts-one* when TM is
; already on the false-type-alist that is to be extended, since in that case,
; the scenario about involving dwp would already find TM on the type-alist, so
; we might as well strengthen the corresponding type by removing the bit for
; *ts-one*.

; Keep this code in sync with *singleton-type-sets*.

; *ts-integer* (< 0 (+ 1 x)) is ~(< x 0).  The symmetric equivalence of (< (+
; -1 x) 0) to ~(< 0 x) is also handled.

; We will assume that the binary-+ has been commuted so that the constant arg,
; if any, is the first.

; Note that the output of this transformation is not subject to the first
; transformation, above, so we do not have to consider repeating that
; transformation.  However, it is conceivable that the output of this
; transformation is subject to its symmetric counterpart.  In particular, if we
; composed this transformation with itself we might reduce (< 0 (+ 1 (+ -1 x)))
; to (< 0 x).  We prefer instead to take the position that some arithmetic
; simplifier will reduce the +-expressions.

; x): the latter might be *ts-integer* and x could either be
; *ts-non-positive-integer* or *ts-integer*, or even a non-number.  Some cases
; we could invert:  if (+ 1 x) is non-positive, then we know x must be strictly
; negative.  But rather than invert, we just call type-set on x, accreting onto

; are all equal to their old values (outside this mv-let).  That is because the
; cond above, which determines the new values of not-flg, arg1 and arg2 here,
; has the property that on the two branches that changes the not-flg, one of
; the two args is set to *0*.  If neither arg is *0* then we could have only
; come out on the last clause of the cond above and not-flg etc are thus
; unchanged.  We use this curious property below.

; The transformations just carried out have the possibly odd effect of
; assuming (< 0 x) false when asked to assume (< x 1) true, for integral x.
; This effectively sets x's type-set to the non-positives.  One might
; then ask, what happens if we later decide to get the type-set of (<
; x 1).  We would hope that, having assumed it, we would realize it
; was true!  Indeed we do, but only because type-set-< makes the same
; normalization of (< x 1).  This raises the question: Could we reduce
; the size of our code by doing the normalization in only one place,
; either here in assume-true-false or there in type-set-<?  The real
; reason we do it in both places has nothing to do with the subtleties
; discussed here; there is no guarantee that both of these functions
; will be called.  If (< x 1) appears in a test, we will call
; assume-true-false on it and we have to normalize it to produce the
; desired tta and fta.  If (< x 1) appears as the entire resultant
; term, we'll just call type-set on it and we have to normalize it to
; decide it.

; Another question raised is: "What about the second transformation done
; above?"  We assume ~(< x 0) when asked to assume (< 0 (+ 1 x)), with the
; effect that x is given (roughly) the type-set non-negative integer.  Note
; that type-set-< does not make this second transformation.  Will we recognize
; (< 0 (+ 1 x)) as true later?  Yes.  If x is non-negative, then type-set
; determines that (+ 1 x) is positive and hence (< 0 (+ 1 x)) is true.

; Start old comment regarding the case that (ts-intersectp ts2

; Long comment on why we extend the true-type-alist to accommodate complex
; numbers.

; For an example that illustrates why we need to put (mcons-term* '< *0* arg2)
; on the true-type-alist explicitly in this case, try the following.

;;; (encapsulate
;;;  (((foo *) => *))
;;;  (local (defun foo (x) (<= 0 x)))
;;;  (defthm foo-type (implies (<= 0 x) (equal (foo x) t))
;;;    :rule-classes :type-prescription))
;;;
;;; (thm (implies (<= 0 x) (equal (foo x) t)))

; If we simply use true-type-alist here, we'll lose the information that (< 0
; arg2).  That is, we desire that the true-type-alist is sufficient for
; deducing what we are assuming true; but if arg2 can be a complex number, we
; will not be able to make that determination.  So, we put this inequality on
; the type-alist, explicitly.  We do so in the order shown for two reasons,
; probably neither of them particularly important (but at least, we document
; what they are).  For one, we want type-set to find the explicit inequality
; first, in case it ever tries to decide it.  Although we do not expect
; type-set to have any trouble even if we bury the inequality after an entry
; for arg2, this coding seems more robust.  More importantly, however, we want
; to call extend-type-alist, which is a bit complicated, on as short a
; type-alist as possible.

; End old comment regarding the case that (ts-intersectp ts2
; *ts-complex-rational*).

; assume-true-false1 below, tta is the result of assuming (car arg) non-nil.
; But if (car arg) is non-nil, then arg is non-nil too.  That is, (implies (car
; arg) arg) is a theorem: Pf.  Consider the contrapositive, (implies (not arg)
; (not (car arg))). Q.E.D.  So we assume arg onto tta as well as (car arg).
; Fta, on the other hand, is the result of assuming (car arg) nil.  That tells
; us nothing about arg, e.g., arg could be nil, a cons (whose car is nil) or
; anything violating car's guard.  Summarizing this case: if xnot-flg is nil,
; then we assume both (car arg) and arg non-nil onto tta and assume only (car
; arg) nil onto fta.

; Now on the other hand, suppose xnot-flg is t.  Then tta contains

; We return a tuple of the form (mv term' ts' ttree') that asserts the
; assumption that term has type set ts (with the given ttree
; attached).  Most often, term', ts' and ttree' are just term, ts and
; ttree.  However, if term is of the form (cons a x) we do certain
; auxiliary processing related to the existence of *ts-true-list* and
; its subtypes.  We guarantee that ttree' includes ttree.

; We make various implicit assumptions about term and ts, all
; summarized by the restriction that this function can only be called
; by assume-true-false after checking the current type-set of term and
; failing to decide the question.

; We start with two examples.  Suppose term is (cons a1 x) and ts is
; *ts-true-list*.  Then the "various implicit assumptions" are
; violated because assume-true-false would never ask us to do this:
; the type-set of term is, at worst, the union of *ts-proper-cons* and
; *ts-improper-cons*, and certainly doesn't include *ts-nil*.  But
; assume-true-false always asks us to assume a type-set that is a
; subset of the current type-set.

; So suppose we are asked to assume that (cons a1 x) is of type
; *ts-proper-cons*.  Then we can deduce that x is of type
; *ts-true-list*.  Indeed, these two are equivalent because if we
; store the latter we can compute the former with type-set.  But
; because x is a subterm of (cons a1 x) we prefer to store the
; assumption about x because it will find greater use.  However, we
; may already know something about the type of x.  For example, x may
; be known to be non-nil.  So we are obliged to intersect the old type
; of x with the newly derived type if we want to keep maximizing what
; we know.  Because of the "implicit assumptions" this intersection
; will never produce the empty type set: if it is impossible for x to
; have the required type, then assume-true-false better not ask us to
; make the assumption.  For example, if x is known not to be a
; true-list, then assume-true-false would never ask us to assume that
; (cons a1 x) is proper.

; The example above is based on the theorem
;    (proper-consp (cons a1 x))   <-> (true-listp x).
; We similarly build in the theorem
;    (improper-consp (cons a1 x)) <-> (not (true-listp x)).

; Historical note on the evolution of type-alist-clause.

; Early on, we had a simple version of type-alist-clause that simply looped
; through the literals in the clause, calling assume-true-false for each one.
; With this approach, before we eliminated guards from the logic, the result
; could be very sensitive to the order of the literals in the clause.  Consider
; the following theorem, which was not proved before we made this change:

; (implies (and (< 1 (+ 1 n))
;               (< 0 n)
;               (integerp n))
;          (equal (< 1 (+ 1 n)) (< 0 n)))

; The problem with this theorem was that the first two hypotheses
; weren't known to be Boolean unless we knew (for example) the third
; hypothesis.  A more low-level example could be obtained by applying
; type-alist-clause to ((< n '0) (not (integerp n)) (equal n '0)), and
; then checking the type-set of n in the resulting type-alist.

; One possible solution was to order the clause heuristically on the
; way in to type-alist-clause.  One nice thing about that idea is that
; the clause is only rearranged locally, so the change will not be
; pervasive.  However, the completeness of this process is
; questionable since the process is not iterative.

; So our next idea, through Version 1.7, was to iterate, calling
; type-alist-clause repeatedly until the answer stabilizes.  Actually we were
; slightly more clever than that.  The main trick was that when we applied
; assume-true-false to a literal, we did so with the force-flg set so that we
; were allowed to generate assumptions.  Then we checked if any assumptions
; were generated as a result.  If so, we delayed consideration of that literal
; and all other such literals until there was no further delay possible.  Note:
; if force-flg was actually t, then no change was necessary.  All this was
; simply to handle the case that force-flg is nil.

; Here are more details on that earlier approach.

; Stage 1:  Repeat the following process:  Loop through all the
; literals, allowing forcing to take place, but if any assumptions are
; generated then delay consideration of that literal.  As long as at
; least one literal seems to contribute to the evolving type-alist in
; a given pass through the loop, we'll pass through the loop again.

; Stage 2:  We may now assume that none of the remaining literals has
; been processed, because they all cause splitting.  We now process
; them all with the force-flg off so that we can be sure that no
; assumptions are generated.

; Stage 3 (perhaps overkill):  Repeat stage 1, but this time give up
; when we make it all the way through the loop without success.

; Starting with Version 1.8, with guards eliminated from the logic, we saw
; no reason to be so clever.  So, we reverted once again to a more
; straightforward algorithm.

; Essay on Repetitive Typing

; Suppose you are asked to assume (not (integerp (1+ i))) and then are asked to
; assume (integerp i).  This might happen if you are building a type-alist for
; a sequence of literals and the literals appear in the order presented above.
; When it happens in that way, it is handled by type-alist-clause.  We have
; tried a variety of solutions to this problem, named and sketched below.

; naive: don't do anything.  The system will fail to note the contradiction
;  above.  This has actually burned Bishop in "real" theorems.

; force-based iteration in type-alist-clause: In Version 1.7 we had an
;  iteration scheme in type-alist-clause based on the fact that (in that
;  version of the system) (1+ i) forced the hyp that i is a number and, by
;  noting the attempted force and skipping the literal, we delayed the
;  processing of the first literal until we had processed the others.  But when
;  Version 1.8 came along and forcing became much less common, this approach
;  was removed and (without much thought) we reverted back to the naive
;  approach and burned Bishop.

; repetitious assume-true-false: The first fix to the situation just described
;  was to define a new version of assume-true-false, called
;  repetitious-assume-true-false, which noted when it added a pair on the
;  type-alist that bound a term which occurred as a proper subterm of some
;  previously bound term.  Thus, when (integerp i) was assumed in the context
;  of (not (integerp (1+ i))), the binding of i provoked
;  repetitious-assume-true-false to recompute the type of the previously bound
;  (1+ i).  To do this, repetitious-assume-true-false had to insist that the
;  recomputation use the "double whammy" idea (so as not to be fooled into just
;  looking up the previously assumed type) and we added the "dwp" flag to the
;  type-set clique.  Repetitious-assume-true-false was used in place of
;  assume-true-false everywhere in the code from rewrite.lisp onwards (i.e.,
;  type-set still used assume-true-false, as did normalize and
;  distribute-first-if).  Note that this is more general than an attack at the
;  type-alist-clause level because it affects any assumption, not just those
;  made at the clause level.  But we found this inefficient and have abandoned
;  it.

; reconsider-type-alist (1): As an alternative to the repetitious
;  assume-true-false, we reverted to the idea of working at the
;  type-alist-clause level, but basing the iteration on something besides
;  forcing.  The idea was to do a simple assume-true-false on each literal of
;  the clause (taking the false type-alist always) and then to reconsider the
;  final type-alist by computing the type of each bound term (with dwp) in the
;  context of the final type-alist.  Observe that we only make one
;  reconsideration pass.  As of this writing (Feb 10, 1995) Version 1.8 uses
;  this style of type-alist-clause.

; Here are some performance measures.

; The simplest example is one which fails unless we do some kind of iterated
; typing.  Here is Bishop's example:

; (thm (IMPLIES (AND (< 0 (+ (- I) N))
;                    (NOT (INTEGERP (+ (- I) N)))
;                    (INTEGERP N)
;                    (INTEGERP I)
;                    )
;               nil))

; The naive method fails to prove this.  Force-based iteration catches it if (-
; I) forces something, but that is not the case in Version 1.8 and so that kind
; of iteration doesn't prove this.  The other two iterative schemes do catch
; it.  In experimenting though be sure to notice whether it is proved by
; type-alist-clause or something more expensive such as linear arithmetic.

; A good performance test is

; (defthm ordered-symbol-alistp-delete-assoc-eq-test
;   (implies (and (ordered-symbol-alistp l)
;                 (symbolp key)
;                 (assoc-eq key l))
;            (ordered-symbol-alistp (delete-assoc-eq key l)))
;   :hints (("Goal" :in-theory
;            (disable ordered-symbol-alistp-delete-assoc-eq))))

; The naive approach does this in about 3.4 seconds (prove time, on Rana, a
; Sparc 2).  The repetitious approach takes 5.6 seconds.  The reconsidering
; approach takes 3.6.  Analysis of the repetitious data show that in this
; example repetitious-assume-true-false is called 5606 times but the repetition
; changes the type-alist only 92 times.  When it does change, the newly bound
; subterm was a variable symbol 80% of the 92 times.  and it was (CAR var) or
; (CDR var) in the remaining 20%.  The low hit rate of the repetitious
; assume-true-false encouraged us to reconsider the idea.

; But the following test convinced us that repetitious assume-true-false is
; doomed.  Consider processing the Nqthm package proofs.  The naive approach
; took about 1683 seconds.  The repetitious approach never completed.  See the
; comment in REWRITE-IF about repetitious-assume-true-false for an explanation.
; The reconsidering approach took 1654 seconds.  Only six events had times more
; than 1 second greater than in the naive approach (and overall, it is about 30
; seconds faster).

(defun type-alist-clause (cl ttree-lst force-flg type-alist ens wrld
                          pot-lst pt)

; We construct an extension of type-alist in which every literal of cl is
; assumed false.  Ttree-lst is a list of ttrees in (weak) 1:1 correspondence
; with cl.  The 'pt tags in the tree corresponding to a given literal indicates
; the parents of that literal.  (By "weak" we allow ttree-lst to be shorter
; than cl and for all "excess literals" of cl to have the nil ttree, i.e., we
; just cdr ttree-lst as we go through cl and use car of the car as a (possibly
; nil) ttree whenever we need a ttree.)  We return three values.  The first is
; t or nil and indicates whether we found a contradiction, i.e., that some
; literal of cl is true.  The second is the resulting type-alist (or nil if we
; got a contradiction).  The third is a ttree explaining the contradiction (or
; nil if we got no contradiction).  The type-alist entries generated for a
; given literal contain the corresponding ttree from ttree-lst.

; Warning: It is probably silly to call this function with force-flg =
; t except for heuristic use, e.g., to see what the probable types of
; some terms are.  The reason is that since we process the lits of cl
; one at a time, we may well add 'assumptions that are in fact denied
; by later literals, causing loops because the case split generates
; the original clause again.  If called with force-flg = t, then the
; type-alist we generate may have 'assumptions in it.  This type-alist
; must be handled with care so that if those assumptions are raised
; the necessary case splits are done.

; Note: Because force-flg can make provisionally false terms look like
; false terms, we sometimes appear simply to have dropped a literal of
; cl.  For example, consider the clause {...(not (acl2-numberp
; (binary-+ x y))) ...}.  Because of force-flg, that literal looks
; false, i.e., binary-+ "always" returns an acl2-numberp.  Assuming
; the literal raises the 'assumptions that x and y are both
; acl2-numberps but sets mbf below to t.  We therefore skip the
; literal, ignoring also its 'assumptions.  If we look at the clause
; as a formula: (implies (and ... (acl2-numberp (+ x y)) ...) ...)
; and imagine ourselves working on the conclusion, it is as though we
; have simply dropped the hypothesis.  This is sound.  More generally,
; we can throw away any pair from a type-alist.  But this is an
; acceptable thing to do here because, first, (acl2-numberp (+ x y))
; tells us nothing about x and y -- they may both be orange trees for
; all we know.  Second (pretending that we are in a pre-1.8 version of
; ACL2, in which the guard for + was part of its defining axiom), if (+ x y)
; occurs in the conjecture anywhere we will assume it is numeric anyway and
; deal with the 'assumptions that its args are acl2-numberps.  So in some
; sense, a hypothesis like (acl2-numberp (+ x y)) is irrelevant because it is
; always given and we pay for it only when it helps us.

; Note: This note ought to be plastered all over this code.  Beware
; the handling of ttree.  A bug was found in this function (11/9/92)
; because in the case that x was a quoted constant it ignored the

; need any help!''  But we must always keep in mind that the ttree
; argument to many functions is an accumulator; the incoming ttree is
; responsible for the derivation of x itself and must be preserved.
; The original comment, above, is accurate: the outgoing ttree must be
; an extension of the incoming one when successful.

(defun equal-x-cons-x-yp (lhs rhs)

; We answer the question ``Is (EQUAL lhs rhs) definitely nil?''  If
; our result is t, then the equality is definitely nil, without
; further qualification.  If we say we don't know, i.e., nil, nothing
; is claimed.

; However, we know some things about lhs and rhs that allow us to
; make this function answer ``I don't know'' more quickly and more
; often than it might otherwise.  We assume that lhs and rhs are not
; identical terms and we know they are not both quoted constants
; (though either may be) and we know that their type sets have a
; non-empty intersection.

; We make our positive decision based on structural reasoning.  For
; example, (EQUAL x (CONS x &)), is NIL because x occurs properly
; within the CONS tree.  This observation does not depend on type-sets or
; anything else.

; However, we don't want to do too much work exploring the two terms.
; For example, if they are both large explicit values we don't want to
; look for them in each other.  We know that we will eventually apply
; the CONS-EQUAL axiom, which will rewrite the equality of two conses
; (constants or otherwise) to the conjoined equalities of their
; components.  Thus, if both lhs and rhs are CONS expressions (i.e., a
; consityp) or quoted list constants, we just return nil and let the
; :REWRITE rules take care of it.

; One more minor optimization: if one of our args is a consityp and
; the other is a quoted constant then the constant must be a consp or
; else the type sets wouldn't intersect.

; Further Work:

; If this function is improved, also consider similar improvements to
; almost-quotep, which, like this function, currently only works on
; cons terms but could be generalized.

; This function has an arithmetic analog.  For example:
;    (EQUAL x (+ a (+ b (+ x c))))
; is NIL if x has type set *ts-acl2-number* and the type set of the
; sum of the other addends, (+ a (+ b c)), does not intersect *ts-zero*.
; We will eventually add :REWRITE rules to normalize + and do cancellation.
; That will make it easier to find x and may in fact subsume the kind of
; reasoning done here.  On the other hand, heuristically it is probably
; good to put every ounce of knowledge we have about these elementary
; things every place we can.

; Similarly, (EQUAL x (* a (* b (* x c)))), is false if x is a non-*ts-zero*
; *ts-acl2-number* and (* a (* b c)) is a non-*ts-integer*.

; Similarly, (EQUAL x (- x)) is nil if x is a non-*ts-zero* *ts-acl2-number*.

; Similarly, (EQUAL x (/ x)) is nil if x is a non-*ts-zero* *ts-ratio*
; or a *ts-complex-rational*.

; Note: In nqthm, instead of using subst-for-nth-arg as below, we used
; subst-expr and hence hit not only the top-level occurrence of the

; because it doesn't search the term for (unlikely) occurrences and
; doesn't cons up a copy of the term.  However, if proofs don't work,
