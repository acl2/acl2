;                            PROCLAIMING
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; Essay on Proclaiming

; The variable acl2::*do-proclaims* determines whether or not we proclaim ACL2
; function types before compiling them.  The intent of proclaiming is to
; improve performance, though we once observed proclaiming to have had the
; opposite effect for some combination of ACL2 and Allegro CL; see a comment in
; proclaim-file.  It might be worthwhile to revisit, from time to time,
; proclaiming in more Lisps, especially those used heavily in the community.

; During the boot-strap we avoid any activity related to proclaiming types
; except, perhaps, by generating or loading file acl2-proclaims.lisp.  At one
; time we did some proclaiming on a file-by-file basis, but this approach
; requires a lot of care to be done right.  For example with *do-proclaims*
; true, compile-acl2 had by default used a file-by-file load/proclaim/compile
; process, while load-acl2 had proclaimed all files after loading the compiled
; files.  We believe that this process allowed load-acl2 to come up with more
; specific function types during load-acl2 than had been used by compile-acl2
; We may have this change in types lead to buggy behavior.

; So in order to proclaim during the boot-strap, we use steps as shown below.
; First, here is the general process, which is currently unused.  But we could
; try it for any Lisp other than GCL; see below for what we do in GCL.  We note
; that GNUmakefile orchestrates both versions of these steps for "make".

; --- COMPILE: ---
; (1) In a fresh Lisp, call compile-acl2 without any proclaiming.
; --- OPTIONALLY PROCLAIM: ---
; (2) In a fresh Lisp, call generate-acl2-proclaims, which does these steps if
;     *do-proclaims* is true (currently, GCL only), and otherwise is a no-op.
;     (a) load-acl2;
;     (b) initialize-acl2;
;     (c) proclaim-files, to write out file "acl2-proclaims.lisp".
; --- OPTIONALLY RECOMPILE: ---
; (3) In a fresh Lisp, if *do-proclaims* is true (also see (2) above), load the
;     generated file "acl2-proclaims.lisp" and then recompile.
; --- SAVE EXECUTABLE: ---
; (4) In a fresh Lisp, call save-acl2, which does these steps:
;     (a) load "acl2-proclaims.lisp" if *do-proclaims* is true;
;     (b) load-acl2;
;     (c) initialize-acl2;
;     (d) save an executable.

; In GCL, we modify this process to utilize GCL's own ability to proclaim
; function types.  Note that this process doesn't proclaim types for defconst
; forms; from a Lisp perspective, that wouldn't make sense, since defconst
; symbols are variables, not constants.

; --- COMPILE: ---
; (1) In a fresh Lisp, call compile-acl2 without any proclaiming, as follows.
;     (compiler::emit-fn t)
;     (acl2::compile-acl2)
;     (compiler::make-all-proclaims "*.fn")
; --- OPTIONALLY PROCLAIM: ---
; (2) In a fresh Lisp, call generate-acl2-proclaims, which does only the following
;     if *do-proclaims* is true, and otherwise is a no-op.
;     Rename sys-proclaim.lisp to acl2-proclaims.lisp.
; --- OPTIONALLY RECOMPILE: ---
; (3) In a fresh Lisp, if *do-proclaims* is true (also see (2) above), load the
;     generated file "acl2-proclaims.lisp" and then recompile.
; --- SAVE EXECUTABLE: ---
; (4) In a fresh Lisp, call save-acl2, which does these steps:
;     (a) load "acl2-proclaims.lisp" if *do-proclaims* is true;
;     (b) load-acl2;
;     (c) initialize-acl2;
;     (d) save an executable.

; At one time we proclaimed for CCL, but one profiling run of a
; compute-intensive include-book form showed that this was costing us some 10%
; of the time.  After checking with Gary Byers we decided that there was little
; if any benefit in CCL for proclaiming functions, so we no longer do it.
; Perhaps we should reconsider some time.  See also comments below in
; *do-proclaims*.

; We considered adding &OPTIONAL to the end of every VALUES form (see comments
; below), based on output (since forgotten) from SBCL.  But GCL has issued
; several dozen warnings during the build when this happened, so for now, since
; we are only proclaiming functions for GCL, we omit the &optional.

(defvar *do-proclaims*

; We may want to experiment for proclaiming with other Lisps besides GCL.  But
; this might not be a good idea, in particular for Allegro CL and CCL (see
; above).

; In fact we experimented with CCL and ACL2(h) on 8/9/2013, by temporarily
; setting this variable to T.  We got these results from "time" for make -j 8
; with target regression-fresh on dunnottar.cs.utexas.edu.  The results are
; inconclusive, so we keep things simple (and avoid stepping on the possibility
; of future CCL improvements) by the skipping of function proclaiming in CCL.

  #+gcl

; The special value of :gcl says to use GCL's automatic mechanism during the

; to use t instead.  Experiments may lead us to prefer one over the other.

; We return either nil or *, or else a type for form that ideally is as small
; as possible.

; Note that this isn't complete.  In particular, ACL2's proclaiming mechanism
; for GCL produces a return type of * for RETRACT-WORLD, because it can return
; what RETRACT-WORLD1 returns, and below we don't account for defined raw Lisp
; functions like RETRACT-WORLD1.  This could presumably be remedied by doing a
; sort of iterative computation of return types till we reach a fixed point,
; but that's for another day.

; Just before creating Version_2.5 we decided to consider proclaiming for
; Lisps other than GCL.  However, our tests in Allegro suggested that this may
; not help.  The comment below gives some details.  Perhaps we will proclaim
; for MCL in the future.  At any rate, CCL (OpenMCL) is supported starting with
; Version_2.8.  We tried proclaiming for that Lisp, but no longer do so; see
; Section "PROCLAIMING" above.

; Here is a summary of three comparable user times from certifying all the ACL2
; books in June 2000, just before Version_2.5 is complete.  The first column,
; labeled "Comp", is the one to be looked at for comparison purposes.  These are
; all done on the same Sun workstation, using Allegro 5.0.1.  The meanings of
; these numbers are explained below.
;
;                                Comp     Actual   Comments
; Recent ACL2 without proclaim:  5:41     5:36:42  no meta
; Recent ACL2 *with*  proclaim:  5:54     5:53:58
; April ACL2 (before non-std.):  5:48     5:35:58  missing some pipeline and ~40
;                                                  sec. user time on powerlists
;
; The "Comp" column estimates how long the run would have taken if all books had
; certified, except that no run gets past book batcher-sort in the powerlists/
; directory.  (The April run bogs down even slightly earlier.)  The first row is
; adjusted by about 4 minutes because the run started with book meta-plus-lessp.
; The April run broke on book basic-def from case-studies/pipeline and hence
; missed the rest of that directory's books.  The above points account for the
; addition of time from "Actual" to the appropriate comparison time in the first
; column.

  "READ cannot handle a comma or comma-atsign unless there is a
pending backquote that will eliminate the *comma* or *comma-atsign*.
In the SPECIAL variable *backquote-counter* we keep track of the number of
backquotes that are currently pending.  It is crucial that this variable
be SPECIAL.")

(defun backquote (x)

  "The two functions BACKQUOTE and BACKQUOTE-LST implement backquote
as described on pp. 349-350 of CLTL1 except that (a) use of vector
notation causes an error and (b) the use of ,. is not permitted."

; It must be emphasized that the ACL2 implementation of backquote is
; only one of many implementations that are consistent with the Common
; Lisp specification of backquote.  That spec requires only that
; backquote produce a form that when evaluated will produce a
; designated object.  We impose the requirement that *acl2-readtable*
; be used both when checking files with ACL2 and when later compiling
; or using those files.  This requirement guarantees that we obtain
; the same behavior of backquote across all Common Lisps.  For
; example, it is an ACL2 theorem, across all Common Lisps that

;   (equal (car '`(,a)) 'cons)

; This theorem is definitely not true about the implementation of
; backquote provided by the implementors of each Common Lisp.  In
; fact, the lefthand side of this theorem represents an informal
; misuse of the backquote notation because one is intended to consider
; the effects of evaluating backquoted forms, not the forms
; themselves.  (In some Common Lisps, the lefthand side might even
; evaluate to a symbol in a nonstandard package.)  Nevertheless,
; because we inflict our definition of backquote on the ACL2 user at
; all times, the above equation is a theorem throughout, so no harm is
; done.  On the other hand, if we used the local implementation of
; backquote of each particular Common Lisp, we would get different
; ACL2 theorems in different Common Lisps, which would be bad.

; Unlike most implementors of backquote, we do no serious
; optimization.  We feel this inattention to efficiency is justified
; at the moment because in the usage we expect, the only serious costs
; will be small ones, during compilation.

; Our backquote always returns a cons-expression on a cons.  In
; particular, '`(a) returns (CONS 'A 'NIL) and not '(a), which would
; be legal in any backquote that produces a constant, e.g., one
; containing no commas.  We rely on the fact that the backquote of a
; cons is a cons-expression in our documentation of methods of
; bypassing the restrictions translate puts on LAMBDA objects in :FN
; slots.  For example, see :DOC gratuitous-lambda-object-restrictions.

; We return (ignore-errors (truename x)) instead of (probe-file x) because we

; the truename (a pathname object).  Otherwise, we return the namestring of
