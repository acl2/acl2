;;; Support for system-verify-guards
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; This section supports a mechanism for users to extend the set of
; guard-verified functions.  They do so in community books under books/system/,
; which are checked when building with feature :acl2-devel, for example
; building with `make' with ACL2_DEVEL=d.  But normal builds will not set that
; feature, and will simply trust that functions marked in
; *system-verify-guards-alist* can be guard-verified.  For more about this, see
; the comments in *system-verify-guards-alist*.

; A flaw in our approach is that user-supplied guard verifications may depend
; on package axioms.  Thus, we view such verifications as strong hints, rather
; than as ironclad guarantees that the functions can be guard-verified in
; definitional (or even conservative) extensions of the ground-zero theory.  We
; consider this sufficient, as the event that some package axiom will cause
; such bogus marking as guard-verified seems much less likely than the event
; that our system has other serious bugs!

; Comment on memoizing a worse-than function:

; In Version_7.0 and several preceding versions, we memoized a "worse-than"
; function as follows.

; (memoize 'worse-than-builtin-memoized :stats nil)

; We now use a clocked version of worse-than and avoid such memoization.  See
; worse-than-builtin-clocked for comments about potential memoization.
; To restore such memoization, search for every occurrence of
; "Comment on memoizing a worse-than function".

; Below, we discuss some earlier experiments on memoizing worse-than-builtin or
; the like, on two particular community books:

; - books/coi/dtrees/base.lisp does not benefit from memoization of worse-than
;   functions, and can be slowed down by it.

; - books/centaur/esim/stv/stv2c/stv2c.lisp requires memoization of
;   worse-than-builtin (or the like) to avoid stalling out in a proof.

; Below we look at some results for the first of these books, using Version_7.0
; except (where indicated below) a development version that was close to
; Version_7.0.

; Except where indicated otherwise, we memoized worse-than-builtin for
; experiments below as follows.

; (memoize 'worse-than-builtin
;          :stats nil
;          :condition ; Sol Swords suggestion
;          '(and (nvariablep term1)
;                (not (fquotep term1))
;                (nvariablep term2)
;                (not (fquotep term2))))

; Specifically, we ran the following commands in the above book's directory.

;   (ld "cert.acl2")
;   (rebuild "base.lisp" t)
;   (in-package "DTREE")
;   (ubt! 'aux-domain-of-dtreemapfix)
;   (skip-proofs (defthm lemma
;                  (implies (set::in a (aux-domain (dtreemapfix map)))
;                           (set::in a (aux-domain map)))))

; In some cases we also ran the following command or the following two commands
; after the commands above but before evaluating the defthm shown below:

;   (acl2::unmemoize 'acl2::worse-than-builtin)
;   #!acl2(memoize 'worse-than-builtin
;            :stats nil
;            :forget t
;            :condition ; Sol Swords suggestion
;            '(and (nvariablep term1)
;                 (not (fquotep term1))
;                  (nvariablep term2)
;                  (not (fquotep term2))))

; Then we submitted the following event.

;   (defthm lemma2-for-aux-domain-of-dtreemapfix
;     (implies (set::in a (aux-domain map))
;              (set::in a (aux-domain (dtreemapfix map)))))

; Times and memory use (last two reports from top) from some experiments are
; shown below.  The key is that all runs with worse-than unmemoized were
; significantly faster than all runs with worse-than memoized, regardless of
; various attempts to speed up that memoization.
