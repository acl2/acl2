File home-page.html is the ACL2 home page.  It is generated from file
home-page.lisp.

The generated manual/ directory contains a version of the manual for
only the ACL2 system, not the community books.  It is probably of
interest only to system developers who want to search a system-only
manual.  Most ACL2 users are much better off looking at the ACL2+Books
manual, which includes documentation for many community books and has
links on the ACL2 home page.  That manual (for ACL2+Books) is
available locally by opening file books/doc/manual/index.html, which
is generated by certifying community books file books/doc/top.lisp.
