(in-package "ACL2")

; We compute information below to help in the reporting of ACL2 code size.

; We assume that the commands in file create-acl2-code-size have already been
; run that create the infile argument for write-acl2-code-size, which in this
; case is acl2-wc.txt.  That file records output from the wc (Linux) command.
; Why not just use our Lisp approach for everything, instead of only for
; counting lines and characters in :doc strings as we do below?  We could, by
; first reading each source file into a string (say, by reading a character and
; then writing it with princ$ into a channel to a string, finally calling
; get-output-stream-string$).  But we started with the wc command, so we simply
; proceeded by taking advantage of that.  If it becomes critical somehow to do
; this task entirely within ACL2, say because of problems with grep, then we
; may reconsider.
