; hons-raw.lisp -- Raw lisp implementation of hash cons and fast alists.  Note
; that the memoization and watch functionality previously provided by this file
; have been moved into memoize-raw.lisp.  This file has undergone a number of
; updates and changes since its original creation in about 2005.

; The original version of this file was contributed by Bob Boyer and Warren
; A. Hunt, Jr.  The design of this system of Hash CONS, function memoization,
; and fast association lists (applicative hash tables) was initially
; implemented by Boyer and Hunt.  The code was subsequently improved by Boyer
; and Hunt, and also by Sol Swords, Jared Davis, and Matt Kaufmann.  This file
; is now maintained by the ACL2 authors (see above).

; This code is well commented and the comments have been contributed and
; improved by all of the authors named above.  However, comments referring to
; "I" or "my" are from Jared, as is the token "BOZO" which he uses to leave
; a note about a wart or modification to consider.

; Despite the comments here, we recommend reading the user-level documentation
; for HONS-AND-MEMOIZATION before diving into this code.

(in-package "ACL2")

; NOTES ABOUT HL-HONS
;
; The "HL-" prefix was introduced when Jared Davis revised the Hons code, and
; "HL" originally meant "Hons Library."  The revision included splitting the
; Hons code from the function memoization code, and took place in early 2010.
; We will now use the term to refer to the new Hons implementation that is
; found below.  It might be helpful to read the Essay on Hons Spaces before
; proceeding.

; Some changes made in HL-Hons, as opposed to the old Hons system, include the
; following.
;
;   - We combine all of the special variables used by the Hons code into an
;     explicit Hons-space structure.
;
;   - Until late 2024 we no longer separately tracked the length of sbits.
;     This change appeared to incur an overhead of 3.35 seconds in a 10-billion
;     iteration loop, but gave us fewer invariants to maintain and made Ctrl+C
;     safety easier.  However, to avoid running up against
;     array-dimension-limit (in GCL starting with version 2.7.0, but
;     conceivably in future Lisps as well), we now use code provided by Camm
;     Maguire based on implementing sbits as a struct that represents an array
;     of "chunks", where each chunk is a bit array.  We believe that the
;     performance of the new implementation stands up well.
;
;   - We have a new static honsing scheme where every normed object has an
;     address, and NIL-HT, CDR-HT, and CDR-HT-EQL aren't needed when static
;     honsing is used.
;
;   - Since normed strings are EQ comparable, we now place cons pairs whose
;     cdrs are strings into the CDR-HT hash table instead of the CDR-HT-EQL
;     hash table in classic honsing.
;
;   - Previously, fast alists were essentially implemented as flex alists.
;     (See the essay about flex alists for an introduction to these
;     structures.)  Now we always create a hash table instead.  This slightly
;     simplifies the code and results in trivially fewer runtime type checks in
;     HONS-GET and HONS-ACONS.  Our implementation does still use flex alists
;     under the hood to implement classic honsing (specifically, in the CDR-HT
;     and CDR-HT-EQL fields of a hons space), where we can imagine often
;     finding cdrs for which we don't have at least 18 separate cars.  But fast
;     alists are much more targeted; if ACL2 users are building fast alists, it
;     seems very likely that they know they are doing something big (or
;     probably big) -- otherwise they wouldn't be bothering with fast alists.


; ESSAY ON CTRL+C SAFETY
;
; The HL-Hons implementation involves certain impure operations.  Sometimes, at
; intermediate points during a sequence of updates, the invariants on a Hons
; Space are violated.  This is dangerous because a user can interrupt at any
; time using 'Ctrl+C', leaving the system in an inconsistent state.
;
; We have tried to avoid sequences of updates that violate invariants.  In the
; rare cases where this isn't possible, we need to protect the sequence of
; updates with 'without-interrupts'.  We assume that SETF itself does not
; suffer from this kind of problem and that the Lisp implementation should
; ensure that, e.g., (SETF (GETHASH ...)) does not leave a hash table in an
; internally inconsistent state.

; CROSS-LISP COMPATIBILITY WRAPPERS
;
; As groundwork toward porting the static honsing scheme to other Lisps that
; might be able to support it, we have added these wrappers for various ccl::
; functionality.

(defmacro hl-mht (&rest args)

; This macro is a wrapper for hl-mht-fn, which in turn is a wrapper for
; make-hash-table.  But here we have a special hack: if :shared is :default
; then we leave it to the underlying Lisp (in particular CCL) to decide about
; :shared and :lock-free.

; Because of our approach to threading, we generally don't need our hash tables
; to be protected by locks.  HL-MHT is essentially like make-hash-table, but on
; CCL creates hash tables that aren't shared between threads, which may result
; in slightly faster updates.

; In Allegro CL 9.0 (and perhaps other versions), make-hash-table causes
; creation of a hash table of a somewhat larger size than is specified by the
; :size argument, which can cause fast-alist-fork to create hash tables of
; ever-increasing size when this is not necessary.  The following example
; illustrates this problem, which was first observed in community book
; books/parsers/earley/earley-parser.lisp.

;   (defconst *end* :end)
;
;   (defn my-fast-alist-fork (a)
;     (let ((ans (fast-alist-fork a *end*)))
;       (prog2$ (fast-alist-free a)
;               ans)))
;
;   (defun my-fast-alist3 (n ans)
;     (declare (type (integer 0 *) n))
;     (cond ((zp n) ans)
;           (t (my-fast-alist3 (1- n)
;                              (my-fast-alist-fork
;                               (hons-acons (mod n 10) (* 10 n) ans))))))
;
;   (trace! (hl-mht-fn :native t :exit t))
;
;   (time$ (my-fast-alist3 33 *end*))

; Our solution is to use a hash table, *allegro-hl-hash-table-size-ht*, to map
; the actual size of a hash table, h, to the :size argument of the call of
; hl-mht that created h.  Then, when we want to create a hash table of a given
; :size, new-size-arg, we look in *allegro-hl-hash-table-size-ht* to check
; whether a previous call of hl-mht created a hash table of that size using
; some :size, old-size-arg, and if so, then we call make-hash-table with :size
; old-size-arg instead of new-size-arg.  (Note that we don't give this special
; treatment in the case that hl-mht is called without an explicit :size; but
; that seems harmless.)

; ESSAY ON STATIC CONSES

; In CCL, one can use (ccl::static-cons a b) in place of (cons a b) to create a
; cons that will not be moved by the garbage collector.
;
; Unlike an ordinary cons, every static cons has a unique index, which is a
; fixnum, and which may be obtained with (ccl::%staticp x).  Per Gary Byers,
; this index will be forever fixed, even after garbage collection, even after
; saving an image.
;
; Even more interesting, the cons itself can be recovered from its index using
; ccl::%static-inverse-cons.  Given the index of a static cons, such as
; produced by ccl::%staticp, %static-inverse-cons produces the corresponding
; static cons.  Given an invalid index (such as the index of a cons that has
; been garbage collected), %static-inverse-cons produces NIL.  Hence, this
; gives us a way to tell if a cons has been garbage collected, and lets us
; implement a clever scheme for "washing" honses.
;
; We now write wrappers for static-cons, %staticp, and %static-inverse-cons, to
; make it easier to plug in alternative implementations in other Lisps.

; CCL::%STATICP always returns a fixnum or nil, as per Gary Byers email June
; 16, 2014.  That email also confirmed that if the value is not nil after a
; garbage collection, then the value is unchanged from before the garbage
; collection; and also, that the value remains unchanged after saving an image.

; Indeed, this function returns a fixnum (see also above) if x is a static
; cons.  More may be true, as follows, but we don't count on it: in mid-2014,
; at least, we see that for CCL, the value returned is 128 for the first static
; cons and is incremented by 1 for each additional static cons -- and after a
; garbage collection, this repeats except that values for remaining static
; conses are skipped.

;
; We use the machine address of an object to compute a hash code within [0,
; 2^20).  We obtain a good distribution on 64-bit CCL, but we have not tried
; this on 32-bit CCL.
;
; We use the CCL primitive ccl::strip-tag-to-fixnum because it always returns a
; fixnum, while ccl::%address-of (which returns the machine address) might
; conceivably not do so, according to email 6/2014 from Gary Byers.  He
; explains that CCL uses ccl::strip-tag-to-fixnum "to derive a fixnum from its
; argument's address (it effectively does something like a right shift by 4
; bits....".
;
; For CCL, we right-shift the address by five places because smaller shifts led
; to worse distributions.  (GCL wart: We haven't really thought this efficiency
; issue through for GCL.)  Gary Byers has informed us (email, 6/16/2014) that
; in 64-bit CCL, memory-allocated objects (like conses) are 16-byte aligned,
; and the bottom 4 bits (all 0) are replaced by tag bits (where those tag bits
; are always 3 for a cons).  So shifting by 4 bits might seem to suffice, but
; we got a significantly better distribution shifting by 5 bits (see discussion
; of experiments below, "However, in addition to fast execution speed....").
;
; It should be easy to change this from 2^20 to other powers of 2.  We think
; 2^20 is a good number, since a 2^20 element array seems to require about 8 MB
; of memory, e.g., our whole cache (which consists of two such arrays; see
; "Implementation 2" of Cache Tables, below) will take 16 MB.

;
;                           CACHE TABLES
;
; ----------------------------------------------------------------------

; A Cache Table is a relatively simple data structure that can be used to
; (partially) memoize the results of a computation.  Cache tables are used by
; the hons implementation, but are otherwise independent from the rest of hons.
; We therefore introduce them here, up front.
;
; The operations of a Cache Table are as follows:
;
;    (HL-CACHE-GET KEY TABLE)         Returns (MV PRESENT-P VAL)
;    (HL-CACHE-SET KEY VAL TABLE)     Destructively modifies TABLE
;
; In many ways, a Cache Table is similar to an EQ hash table, but there are
; also some important differences.  Unlike an ordinary hash table, a Cache
; Table may "forget" some of its bindings at any time.  This allows us to
; ensure that the Cache Table does not grow beyond a fixed size.
;
; Cache Tables are not thread safe.
;
; We have two implementations of Cache Tables.
;
; Implementation 1.  For Lisps other than 64-bit CCL (#-static-hons).
;
;    A Cache Table is essentially an ordinary hash table, along with a separate
;    field that tracks its count.
;
;    It is almost an invariant that this count should be equal to the
;    HASH-TABLE-COUNT of the hash table, but we do NOT rely upon this for
;    soundness and this property might occasionally be violated due to
;    interrupts.  In such cases, we ensure that the count is always more than
;    the HASH-TABLE-COUNT of the hash table.  (The only negative consequence of
;    this is that the table may be cleared more frequently.)
;
;    The basic scheme is as follows.  Whenever hl-cache-set is called, if the
;    count exceeds our desired threshold, we clear the hash table before we
;    continue.  The obvious disadvantage of this is that we may throw away
;    results that may be useful.  But the advantage is that we ensure that the
;    cache table does not grow.  On one benchmark, this approach was about
;    17% slower than letting the hash table grow without restriction (notably
;    ignoring all garbage collection costs), but it lowered the memory usage
;    from 2.8 GB to 92 MB.
;
;    We have considered improving the performance by experimenting with the
;    size of its cache.  A larger cache means less frequent clearing but
;    requires more memory.  We also looked into more smartly clearing out the
;    cache.  One idea was to throw away only half of the entries "at random" by
;    just allowing the maphash order to govern whether we throw out one entry
;    or another.  But when this was slow, we discovered that, at least on CCL,
;    iterating over a hash table is fairly expensive and requires the keys and
;    values of the hash table to be copied into a list.  For a 500k cache,
;    "clearing" half the entries required us to allocate 6 MB, and ruined
;    almost all memory savings we had hoped for.  Hence, we just use ordinary
;    clrhash.
;
; Implementation 2.  For 64-bit CCL (#+static-hons) we use a better scheme.
;
;    A Cache Table contains two arrays, KEYDATA and VALDATA.  These arrays
;    associate "hash codes" (array indices) to keys and values, respectively.
;    We could have used a single array with (key . val) pairs as its entries,
;    but using two separate arrays allows us to implement hl-cache-set with no
;    consing.
;
;    These hash codes are based upon the actual machine address of KEY, and
;    hence (1) may easily collide and (2) are not reliable across garbage
;    collections.  To give a sensible semantics, in hl-cache-get, we must
;    explicitly check that this hash code has the proper KEY.
;
;    Our hashing function, hl-machine-hash, performs quite well.  According to
;    a rough test, it takes only about the same time as about 11 fixnum
;    additions.  Just below is a log of our tests (on a 2010 MacBook Pro).

; ESSAY ON HONS SPACES
;
; The 'ACL2 Objects' are described in the ACL2 function bad-lisp-objectp;
; essentially they are certain "good" symbols, characters, strings, and
; numbers, recursively closed under consing.  Note that live stobjs are not
; ACL2 Objects under this definition.
;
; The 'Hons Spaces' are fairly complex structures, introduced with the
; defstruct for hl-hspace, which must satisfy certain invariants.  At any time
; there may be many active Hons Spaces, but separate threads may never access
; the same Hons Space!  This restriction is intended to minimize the need to
; lock while accessing Hons Spaces.
;
;    Aside.  Sharable Hons Spaces might have some advantages.  They might
;    result in lower overall memory usage and reduce the need to re-hons data
;    in multiple threads.  They might also be a better fit for ACL2(p)'s
;    parallelism routines.  But acquiring locks might slow honsing in
;    single-threaded code and make our code more complex.  Parallelism wart: We
;    may investigate this later.
;
;
; Fundamental Operations.
;
; A Hons Space provides two fundamental operations.
;
; First, given any ACL2 Object, X, and any Hons Space HS, we must be able to
; determine whether X is 'normed' with respect to HS.  The fundamental
; invariant of normed objects is that if A and B are both normed with respect
; to HS, then (EQUAL A B) holds iff (EQL A B).
;
; Second, given any ACL2 Object, X, and any Hons Space, HS, we must be able to
; 'norm' X to obtain an ACL2 Object that is EQUAL to X and which is normed with
; respect to HS.  Note that norming is 'impure' and destructively modifies HS.
; This modification is really an extension: any previously normed object will
; still be normed, but previously non-normed objects may now also be normed.
;
;
; Tracking Normed Objects.
;
; To support these operations, a Hons Space contains certain hash tables and
; arrays that record which ACL2 Objects are currently regarded as normed.
;
; Symbols, characters, and numbers.  These objects automatically and trivially
; satisfy the fundamental invariant of normed objects.  We therefore regard all
; symbols, characters, and numbers as normed with respect to any Hons Space,
; and nothing needs to be done to track whether particular symbols, characters,
; or numbers are normed.
;
; Strings.  Within each Hons Space, we may choose some particular string, X, as
; the normed version of all strings that are equal to X.  We record this choice
; in the STR-HT field of the Hons Space, which is an EQUAL hash table.  The
; details of what we record in the STR-HT actually depend on whether 'classic
; honsing' or 'static honsing' is being used.  See below.
;
; Conses.  Like strings, there are EQUAL conses which are not EQL.  We could
; account for this by setting up another equal hash table, as we did for
; strings, but EQUAL hashing of conses can be very slow.  More efficient
; schemes are possible because we insist upon two reasonable invariants:
;
;   INVARIANT C1.  The car of a normed cons must be normed.
;   INVARIANT C2.  The cdr of a normed cons must be normed.
;
; Using these invariants, we have developed two schemes for tracking which
; conses are normed.  One approach, called classic-honsing, makes use of only
; ordinary Common Lisp functions.  The second approach, static-honsing, is
; higher performance but requires features that are specific to Clozure Common
; Lisp.


; ESSAY ON CLASSIC HONSING
;
; Prerequisite: see the essay on hons spaces.
;
; Classic Honsing is a scheme for tracking normed conses that can be used in
; any Lisp.  Here, every normed cons is recorded in one of three hash tables.
; In particular, whenever X = (A . B) is normed, then X will be found in
; either:
;
;    NIL-HT, when B is NIL,
;    CDR-HT, when B is a non-NIL symbol, a cons, or a string, or
;    CDR-HT-EQL otherwise.
;
; The NIL-HT binds A to X whenever X = (A . NIL) is a normed cons.  Thanks to
; Invariant C1, which assures us that A will be normed, we only need to use an
; EQL hash table for NIL-HT.
;
; For other conses, we basically implement a two-level hashing scheme.  To
; determine if a cons is normed, we first look up its CDR in the CDR-HT or
; CDR-HT-EQL, depending on its type.  Both of these tables bind B to the set of
; all normed X such that X = (A . B) for any A.  These sets are represented as
; 'flex alists', defined later in this file.  So, once we have found the proper
; set for B, we look through it and see whether there is a normed cons in it
; with A as its CAR.
;
; We use the CDR-HT (an EQ hash table) for objects whose CDRs are
; EQ-comparable, and the CDR-HT-EQL (an EQL hash table) for the rest.  We may
; use CDR-HT for both strings and conses since, by Invariant C2, we know that
; the CDR is normed and hence pointer equality suffices.
;
; The only other thing to mention is strings.  In the classic honsing scheme,
; the STR-HT simply associates each string to its normed version.  That is, a
; string X is normed exactly when (eq X (gethash X STR-HT)).  It is
; straightforward to norm a string X: a STR-HT lookup (using EQUAL) tells us
; whether a normed version of X exists and, if so, what it is.  Otherwise, when
; no normed version of X exists, we effectively 'norm' X by extending the
; STR-HT by binding X to itself.
;
; Taken all together, the STR-HT, NIL-HT, CDR-HT, and CDR-HT-EQL completely
; determine which ACL2 objects are normed in the classic honsing scheme.


; ESSAY ON STATIC HONSING
;
; Prerequisite: see the Essay on Hons Spaces and the Essay on Static Conses.
;
; Static Honsing is a scheme for tracking normed conses that can be used only
; in Clozure Common Lisp (CCL).
;
; Static Honsing is an alternative to classic honsing that exploits static
; conses for greater efficiency.  Static conses are conses with several
; interesting properties: to each static cons there corresponds a unique
; natural number ``index''; it is possible to ``invert'' the index to retrieve
; the static cons; each static cons has a fixnum ``machine address.''  Static
; conses were implemented by Gary Byers and references to ``Gary'' below are to
; him.
;
; Here, only static conses can be considered normed, and SBITS is a structure
; that records which static conses are currently normed.  That is, suppose X is
; a static cons and let I be the index of X.  Then X is considered normed
; exactly when the Ith bit stored in SBITS is 1.  This is a very fast way to
; determine if a cons is normed!
;
;
; Addresses for Normed Objects.
;
; To support hons construction, we also need to be able to do the following:
; given two normed objects A and B, find the normed version of (A . B) or
; determine that none exists.
;
; Toward this goal, we first develop a reliable 'address' for every normed
; object; this address has nothing to do with machine (X86, PowerPC, or other)
; addresses.  To begin, we statically assign addresses to NIL, T, and certain
; small integers.  In particular (see also historic notes below):
;
;    Characters are given addresses 0-255, corresponding to their codes.
;    NIL and T are given addresses 256 and 257, respectively.
;    Integers in [-2^14, 2^23] are given the subsequent addresses
;    successively starting at -2^14 (address 258).
;
; All other objects are dynamically assigned addresses.  In particular, suppose
; that BASE is the start of the dynamically-allocated range.  Then,
;
;    The address of a static cons, C, is Index(C) + BASE, where Index(C) is the
;    index returned by HL-STATICP.
;
;    For any other atom, X, we construct an associated static cons, say X_C,
;    and then use Index(X_C) + BASE as the address of X.
;
; This scheme gives us a way to generate a unique, reliable address for every
; ACL2 Object we encounter.  These addresses start small and increase as more
; static conses are created.
;
; We record the association of these "other atoms" to their corresponding
; static conses in different ways, depending upon their types:
;
;   For symbols, the static cons is stored in the 'hl-static-address property
;   for the symbol.  This results in something a little bizarre: symbol
;   addresses are implicitly shared across all Hons Spaces, and so we must take
;   care to ensure that our address-allocation code is thread safe.
;
;   For strings, the STR-HT binds each string X to the pair XC = (NX
;   . TRUE-ADDR), where NX is the normed version of X and XC is a static cons
;   whose address is TRUE-ADDR (see hl-hspace-norm-atom).
;
;   For any other atoms, the Hons Space includes OTHER-HT, an EQL hash table
;   that associates each atom X with X_C, the static cons for X.
;
; In the future, we might want to think about the size of BASE.  Gary might be
; be able to extend static cons indices so that they start well after 128,
; perhaps eliminating the need to add BASE when computing the addresses for
; static conses.  On the other hand, it's probably just a matter of who is
; doing the addition, and our current scheme gives us good control over the
; range.
;
;
; Address-Based Hashing.
;
; Given the addresses of two normed objects, A and B, the function
; hl-addr-combine generates a unique integer that can be used as a hash key.
;
; Each Hons Space includes ADDR-HT, an EQL hash table that associates these
; keys to the normed conses to which they correspond.  In other words, suppose
; C = (A . B) is a normed cons, and KEY is the key generated for the addresses
; of A and B.  Then ADDR-HT associates KEY to C.
;
; Hence, assuming A and B are normed, we can determine whether a normed cons of
; the form (A . B) exists by simply generating the proper KEY and then checking
; whether ADDR-HT includes an entry for this key.
;
; We maintain the invariant that SBITS and ADDR-HT must correspond as described
; above.  That is, if SBITS is 1 at index idx, then idx is the index of a
; static cons that is a key of ADDR-HT; and if C is a key of ADDR-HT, then C is
; a static cons such that SBITS is 1 at the index of C.

; Default Sizes.  The user can always call hl-hons-resize to get bigger tables,
; but we still want good defaults.  These sizes are used in the structures that
; follow.  We try to avoid using any size less than 100.  A hash table of size
; 100 is pretty small and should be cheap to allocate, and making a hash table
; under that size is possibly not a very sensible thing to do, as it may
; quickly require resizing, etc.

; some bad behavior when remhashes are mixed in with puthashes in certain
; patterns.  One of these is noted below by Jared in the "Truly disgusting

; should be resized, it is instead rehashed in place if it contains any deleted
; elements -- so if you grow up to 99% of capacity and then repeatedly insert
; and delete elements, you're likely to spend a lot of time rehashing without

;
; [Jared]: Truly disgusting hack.  As of Clozure Common Lisp revision 14519, in
; the non lock-free version of 'remhash', there is a special case: deleting the
; last remaining element from a hash table triggers a linear walk of the hash
; table, where every element in the vector is overwritten with the
; free-hash-marker.  This is devastating when there is exactly one active fast
; alist: every "hons-acons" and "fast-alist-free" operation requires a linear
; walk over the TABLE.  This took me two whole days to figure out.  To ensure
; that nobody else is bitten by it, and that I am not bitten by it again, here
; I ensure that the TABLE always has at least one fast alist within it.  This
; alist is unreachable from any ordinary ACL2 code so it should be quite hard
; to free it.  BOZO: Jared thinks it would be reasonable to see if this problem
; is fixed in CCL, in which case this code could be simplified.

#+static-hons
(progn ; sbits structure and operations

; Essay on the Sbits Structure

; This block provides the implementation of the sbits structure used when
; #+static-hons is true.  We are grateful to Camm Maguire for contributing code
; here, to replace an earlier implementation for which sbits was a single bit
; array.  The change was provoked by the discovery of certification errors when
; attempting to grow that array beyond the value of array-dimension-limit while
; running ACL2 built on GCL 2.7.0, as that value is much smaller than the value
; in CCL and previous versions of GCL.  Future Lisp implementations might have
; an even smaller array-dimension-limit, as the Common Lisp HyperSpec only
; requires array-dimension-limit to be at least 1024 (but GCL 2.7.0 might well
; have the smallest array-dimension-limit as of late 2024, at 2^28).

; So instead of a single bit array, the sbits structure is an array of
; "chunks", each of which is a bit array of length 2^23.  When sbits was a
; single bit array, its ith component was 1 when the corresponding memory
; location (see hl-staticp) stored a static cons.  Now we have an array of
; "chunks", where each chunk is a bit-array.

; +sbits-chunk-size+ is the length of each chunk; see sbits-grow, which adds
; one new chunk to the sbits-chunks of an sbits structure.  An index returned
; by hl-staticp indicates whether the corresponding address holds a static
; cons, as follows.  The low +sbits-chunk-width+ many bits (so, the low 23
; bits) of that index are used to index into a chunk, after obtaining that
; chunk by using the remaining high bits to index into the sbits-chunks of the
; sbits structure.

; The choice of 23 here is somewhat arbitrary.  Since each chunk (as described
; above) is an array of 2^+sbits-chunk-width+, and since 2^28 =
; array-dimension-limit in GCL 2.7.0, +sbits-chunk-width+ can presumably be up
; to 27.  With that restriction, the array length of each chunk, namely
; +sbits-chunk-size+ (which is 2^+sbits-chunk-width+, as defined below using
; ash), is less than array-dimension-limit.  Of course, the total possible
; number of chunks must also be less than array-dimension-limit.  That total is
; roughly the maximum possible value of (hl-staticp x) divided by
; +sbits-chunk-size+.  If the total memory is 128GB, i.e., (expt 2 37) bytes,
; then in 64-bit GCL, hl-staticp is less than (expt 2 33), so the total number
; of chunks is at most (/ (expt 2 33) (expt 2 23)) = 1024.  Camm Maguire points
; out that there are about 24 bytes per element of sbits-chunks, which isn't
; much relative to the total memory usage for the sbits structure.

; ESSAY ON FLEX ALISTS (Classic Honsing Only)
;
; Given certain restrictions, a 'flex alist' is similar to an EQL alist, except
; that it is converted into a hash table after reaching a certain size.
;
;   RESTRICTION 1.  A flex alist must be used according to the single threaded
;   discipline, i.e., if you extend a flex alist A to a new flex alist, then
;   you must no longer use A as a flex alist.
;
;   RESTRICTION 2.  A flex alist must never be extended twice with the same
;   key.  This ensures that the entry returned by flex-assoc is always EQ to
;   the unique entry which was inserted by flex-acons and permits trivial
;   optimizations during the conversion to hash tables.
;
; Flex alists may be either ordinary, nil-terminated alists or hash tables.
; The idea is to avoid creating hash tables until there are enough elements to
; warrant doing so.  That is, a flex alist starts out as an alist, but may be
; dynamically promoted to a hash table after a certain size is reached.
;
; The main use of flex alists is in the CDR-HT and CDR-HT-EQL fields of a
; hons space.
;
; [Jared]: I wonder if a larger threshold would be better.  It might be worth
; having slow honsp checks when alists are in the 20-100 range in exchange for
; lower memory usage.

(defmacro hl-flex-alist-maxed-out (x)

; (hl-flex-alist-maxed-out x) == (> (length x) 18) for proper lists.  It is
; inspired by the Milawa function len-over-250p.  Although it is ugly, it is
; faster than looping and counting.  It is also faster on short lists (all of
; length at most 19) than `(not (eq nil (nthcdr 18 ,x))).

;                       STATIC HONS ADDRESSING
;
; ----------------------------------------------------------------------

; Our hashing scheme (see hl-addr-combine) performs best when both addresses
; involved are under 2^30.  In other words, there are about 1,073 million
; "fast-hashing" addresses and the rest are "slow-hashing".
;
; Historic notes.
;
; We did not originally statically assign addresses to the characters, and do
; not think it is particularly important to do so.  But, we like the idea of
; using numbers besides 0 and 1 as the addresses for T and NIL, under the
; probably misguided and certainly untested theory that perhaps using larger
; numbers will result in a better hashing distribution.
;
; We originally assigned a static, fast-hashing address for all integers in
; [-2^24, 2^24], and this decision "used up" about 33.6 million or 1/32 of the
; available fast-hashing addresses.  We later decided that this seemed slightly
; excessive, and we scaled the range down to [-2^14, 2^23].  This new scheme
; uses up 8.4 million or 1/128 of the fast-hashing addresses.  As a picture, we
; have:
;
;    8m                                                  1.07 bn

;
; We think this change is pretty much irrelevant and you shouldn't spend your
; time thinking about how to improve it.  Why?
;
;   (1) For most reasonable computations, slow addresses are never even used
;       and so this change won't matter at all.
;
;   (2) On the other hand, imagine a really massive computation that needs,
;       say, 2 billion normed conses.  Here, we are already paying the price of
;       slow addresses for half the conses.  Our change might mean that 1.06
;       billion instead of 1.04 billion of these conses will have fast-hashing
;       addresses, but this is only about 1% of the conses, so its effect on
;       performance is likely minimal.
;
; Even for applications that just barely exceed the boundary of slow-hashing,
; we're only talking about whether a small percentage of the conses have fast-
; or slow-hashing addresses.

;                            ADDR LIMIT
;
; ----------------------------------------------------------------------

; ESSAY ON ADDR-LIMIT (Static Honsing Only)
;
; This is a new feature that Jared added in January 2012.
;
; The ADDR-HT can grow very large.  For example, as an experiment I made an
; ADDR-HT with room for 100 million honses and filled it up to 99% full.  The
; total space it used was about 3.8 GB: 1.6 GB of actual cons data and 2.2 GB
; of overhead just for the table itself.  In some of our proofs, we allocate an
; address table with room for 500 million entries.  In this case, the size of
; the hash table's array (i.e., not counting the conses) would be 11 GB.
;
; Because of this, resizing the ADDR-HT can be very damaging.  What do I mean
; by this?  Note that resizing a hash table generally involves:
;
;   (1) Allocating a new hash table that is bigger
;   (2) Moving elements from the old hash table into the new hash table
;   (3) Freeing the old hash table (immediately or later via GC)
;
; Until step 3 completes, we need to simultaneously have both the old and new
; tables allocated.  But if the old table is already 11 GB, and we try to
; allocate a new table with 1.5x more space, the new table will be 16.5 GB and
; we'll need a total of 27.5 GB just for these tables.
;
; Practically, grabbing this much memory at once can be a problem.  If we're in
; the middle of a big proof and we have giant memoization tables laying around,
; we might already be running close to the max physical memory of the machine.
; In this situation, trying to grab another 16.5 GB just because we want one
; more HONS is probably a terrible idea.  It could cause us to start swapping,
; etc.  But as a Common Lisp hash table, the ADDR-HT will be resized when the
; Lisp decides, and there's not really anything we can do about it.
;
; The ADDR-LIMIT is an attempt to avoid this kind of trouble.  The basic idea
; is that shortly before resizing the ADDR-HT, we will call the function
; HL-ADDR-LIMIT-ACTION, which will inspect the ADDR-HT table and see if it's
; big enough to warrant doing anything drastic before the resize.  If it is big
; enough, we will do a CLEAR-MEMOIZE-TABLES and a HONS-WASH, which can throw
; away the hash table before growing it.  (But we will be able to restore the
; ADDR-HT from SBITS using HL-STATIC-INVERSE-CONS; see HL-REBUILD-ADDR-HT.)
;
; A practical difficulty of implementing this scheme is that Common Lisp
; doesn't give us a pre-resize hook for a hash table.  Instead, we have to keep
; track of how full the ADDR-HT is to decide when to call HL-ADDR-LIMIT-ACTION.
; We just add a counter, ADDR-LIMIT, for this purpose.  The idea is that this
; counter gets decreased every time we add a HONS into the ADDR-HT, and when it
; reaches zero we will trigger the action.
;
; The ADDR-LIMIT itself should be regarded merely as a performance counter and
; we generally do not make any claims about its accuracy or relevance to
; anything.  We insist that it is a fixnum for performance, and this should
; cause no soundness issues in practice.

;    ** may install a new ADDR-HT, SBITS (hons-wash via hl-addr-limit-action)

;
; X is any ACL2 Object and might be normed or not; HS is a Hons Space.  We
; return an object that is EQUAL to X and is normed.  This may require us to
; destructively extend HS.
;
; This function is non-destructive with respect to X.  Because of this, we
; sometimes need to recons portions of X.  Why?
;
;   One reason is that in static honsing we may only regard static conses as
;   normed, so if X includes non-static conses we will need to produce static
;   versions of them.
;
;   Another scenario is as follows.  Suppose X is (A . B), where B is normed
;   but A is not normed, and further suppose that there exists some normed A'
;   which is EQUAL to A, but no normed X' that is equal to X.  Here, we cannot
;   simply extend HS to regard X as normed, because this would violate our
;   invariant that the car of any normed cons is also normed.  Instead, we must
;   construct a new cons whose car is A' and whose cdr is B, and then use this
;   new cons as X'.
;
; We memoize the norming process to some degree.  The NORM-CACHE field of the
; Hons Space is a Cache Table (see above) that associates some recently
; encountered conses with their normed versions.
;
; Historically, we used a hash table instead.  A basic problem with this was,
; when should the table be created?  We surely do not want to have to create a
; new hash table every time hons-copy is called -- after all, it's called twice
; in every call of hons!  On the other hand, we don't want to use a global hash
; table that never gets cleaned out, because such a table could grow very large
; over time.  Our first solution was to split norming into two functions.  An
; auxiliary function did all the work, and freely used a hash table without
; regard to how large it might grow.  Meanwhile, a top-level wrapper function
; examined the hash table after the auxiliary function was finished, and if the
; table had been resized, we threw it away and started over.
;
; Using a global Cache Table nicely solves this problem.  The Cache Table keeps
; a fixed size and automatically forgets elements.

;    2. For every (KEY . VAL) pair in AL, KEY is normed.  This justifies our
;       use of EQL-based backing hash tables.
;
;    3. The backing hash table, HT, must "agree with" AL.  In particular, for
;       all ACL2 Objects, KEY, the following relation must be satisfied:
;
;        (equal (hons-assoc-equal KEY AL)
;               (gethash (hons-copy KEY) HT))
;
;       In other words, for every (KEY . VALUE) pair in AL, HT must associate
;       KEY to (KEY . VALUE).  Meanwhile, if KEY is not bound in AL, then it
;       must not be bound in HT.
;
; PREVIOUSLY we also insisted that each AL consists entirely of conses, i.e.,
; there are no "malformed" entries in the alist.  We abandoned this requirement
; to allow MAKE-FAST-ALIST to be the identity.
;
; The FALTABLE might as well have been an EQ hash table, and historically it
; was.  But this meant that each HONS-ACONS had to do:
;
;     - (GETHASH ALIST FALTABLE)                 find the current HT
;     - (REMHASH ALIST FALTABLE)                 disassociate HT from ALIST
;     - (SETF (GETHASH KEY HT) VAL)              update HT
;     - (SETF (GETHASH NEW-ALIST FALTABLE) HT)   associate HT with NEW-ALIST
;
; This takes a lot of FALTABLE updates (three for each hons-acons) and all of
; this hashing gets expensive.  To avoid it, we changed the FALTABLE into a
; structure which had a hash table and also a very small (two slot) cache in
; the front.  This cache lets us be working with up to two fast alists without
; having to hash to find the backing hash tables.


; ESSAY ON CTRL+C SAFETY FOR FAST ALISTS
;
; Ctrl+C safety is really difficult for fast alists.  The function
; hl-hspace-hons-acons provides the simplest example of the problem.  You might
; think that the PROGN in this function (and similarly, in
; hl-hspace-hons-acons!) should be a without-interrupts instead.  After all, an
; ill-timed interrupt by the user could cause us to remove the old hash table
; from FALTABLE without installing the new hash table, potentially leading to
; discipline failures even in otherwise perfectly disciplined user-level code.
;
; But the problem runs deeper than this.  Even if we used without-interrupts,
; it wouldn't be enough.  After all, an equally bad scenario is that we
; successfully install the new table into FALTABLE, but then are interrupted
; before ANS can be returned to the user's code.  It hardly matters that the
; hash table has been properly installed if they don't have the new handle to
; it.
;
; There really isn't any way for us, in the implementation of fast alists, to
; prevent interrupts from violating single-threaded discipline.  Consider for
; instance a sequence such as:
;
;   (defconst *foo* (make-fast-alist ...))
;   (defconst *bar* (do-something (hons-acons 0 t *foo*)))
;
; Here, if the user interrupts do-something at any time after the inner
; hons-acons has been executed, then the hash table for *foo* has already been
; extended and there's no practical way to maintain discipline.
;
; Because of this, we abandon the goal of trying to maintain discipline across
; interrupts, and set upon a much easier goal of ensuring that whatever hash
; tables happen to be in the FALTABLE are indeed accurate reflections of the
; alists that are bound to them.  This weaker criterion means that the progn
; below is adequate.

  ;; After we've GC'd the honses in hons-wash, we will look at how many honses
  ;; survived.  If there are fewer than OLD-SIZE * THRESHOLD honses surviving,
  ;; we'll stay with the old size.  Otherwise, we'll allocate a new hash table
  ;; with room for more entries.  BOZO: This parameter could probably use some
  ;; tuning.

  ;; Explanation:

  ;; We're trying to strike a balance here between a couple of competing
  ;; desires.  Here's a scenario.  We allocate room for 100 million honses and
  ;; then we start up a long-running computation that's going to create 500
  ;; million honses before it's done (but some of these honses are going to be
  ;; ephemeral).

  ;; We get to 100 million honses in and we are out of room, so we have to
  ;; wash.  We start by doing a fancy garbage collection to get rid of whatever
  ;; honses are no longer reachable.  Now we need to decide whether or not we
  ;; should grow the ADDR-HT.  Some cases are easy:

  ;;   - If only 10 million honses are still reachable, then we're doing great:
  ;;     we freed up plenty of space and so we probably won't have to wash
  ;;     again for quite some time.  Don't grow the addr-ht, because it already
  ;;     has plenty of room for continued computation.

  ;;   - If 99 million honses are still reachable, then very few of the honses
  ;;     were ephemeral and it's very likely that in order to keep going we're
  ;;     going to need more space.  We definitely want to grow.  If we don't,
  ;;     we'll just be back here, washing again, after a very short time, and
  ;;     we'll get into a kind of thrashing loop.

  ;; The middle ground is where it's tricky.  At what point is it worth resizing?
  ;; We're picking 0.75 for now.

; (HL-HSPACE-HONS-WASH HS) --> NIL and destructively modifies HS
;
; We try to GC normed honses but we do not try to GC normed atoms that might be
; unreachable except for their entries in the STR-HT and OTHER-HT.  We have
; considered how we might extend this function to also collect these atoms, but
; have concluded it probably isn't worth doing.  Basically, we would need to
; separately record the indexes of the static conses in these tables, which is
; fine but would require us to allocate some memory.
;
;    (BOZO it might be possible to make STR-HT and OTHER-HT weak, but I haven't
;     really thought it all the way through.)
;
; IMPORTANT OBLIGATIONS OF THE CALLER.
;
; For this to work correctly in practice, it is critical that the ADDR-HT is
; not LET-bound anywhere in the call stack above this function.  We want
; setting (hl-hspace-addr-ht hs) to NIL to be sufficient to make the ADDR-HT
; unreachable, so that it can be GC'd.
;
; This function can be called by any ordinary hons-creating operation such as
; HL-HSPACE-HONS, HL-HSPACE-HONS-NORM, etc.  This raises some subtle issues,
; because you can imagine "ordinary" implementation level code that looks like
; this:
;
;    (let ((addr-ht (hl-hspace-addr-ht hs))
;          (fal-ht  (hl-hspace-fal-ht hs))
;          (...     (... (hl-hspace-hons ...)))
;          (...     (foo addr-ht fal-ht)))
;       ...)
;
; It would be a very bad error to write something like this: one can no longer
; assume that ADDR-HT is the same after a hons-creating operation.  (This has
; also always been true of SBITS: that is, calling any hons-creating operation
; might alter SBITS).
;
; What about the other Hons Space fields?  Except for the ADDR-HT and SBITS,
; the other fields like the FAL-HT, PERSIST-HT, NORM-CACHE, etc. are all
; restored at the end of a wash, so there's no problem with let-binding them
; and assuming they are the same.  It is only the ADDR-HT and SBITS that we
; must be cautious with.

(defparameter *default-hs*

; We hide the hons space from the ACL2 user by making all ACL2-visible
; functions operate with respect to *default-hs*, the "default hons space."
;
; We allow *default-hs* to be either NIL or a valid hons space.  This is useful
; for ACL2(p) or other (e.g., ttag-based, raw lisp) uses of parallelism.  The
; idea is to allow threads that don't do any honsing to avoid the overhead of
; creating a hons space.  For instance, in ACL2(p), the function
; consume-work-on-work-queue-when-there is responsible for creating all worker
; threads.  This function immediately binds *default-hs* to NIL, which is quite
; cheap.  The first time such a thread needs a hons, a fresh hons space will
; then be automatically created.
