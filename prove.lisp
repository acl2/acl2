; Section:  PREPROCESS-CLAUSE

; The preprocessor is the first clause processor in the waterfall when
; we enter from prove.  It contains a simple term rewriter that expands
; certain "abbreviations" and a gentle clausifier.

; We first develop the simple rewriter, called expand-abbreviations.

; Rockwell Addition: We are now concerned with lambdas, where we
; didn't used to treat them differently.  This extra argument will
; show up in several places during a compare-windows.

; If lambda-flg is nil, we treat lambdas as though they were function
; symbols.

; This function is essentially like rewrite but is more restrictive in its use
; of rules.  We rewrite term/alist maintaining geneqv and pequiv-info, avoiding
; the expansion or application of lemmas to terms whose fns are in
; fns-to-be-ignored-by-rewrite.  We return a new term and a ttree (accumulated
; onto our argument) describing the rewrite.  We only apply "abbreviations"
; which means we expand lambda applications and non-rec fns provided they do
; not duplicate arguments or introduce IFs, etc. (see abbreviationp), and we
; apply those unconditional :REWRITE rules with the same property.

; It used to be written:

;  Note: In a break with Nqthm and the first four versions of ACL2, in
;  Version 1.5 we also expand IMPLIES terms here.  In fact, we expand
;  several members of *expandable-boot-strap-non-rec-fns* here, and
;  IFF.  The impetus for this decision was the forcing of impossible
;  goals by simplify-clause.  As of this writing, we have just added
;  the idea of forcing rounds and the concomitant notion that forced
;  hypotheses are proved under the type-alist extant at the time of the
;  force.  But if the simplifier sees IMPLIES terms and rewrites their
;  arguments, it does not augment the context, e.g., in (IMPLIES hyps
;  concl) concl is rewritten without assuming hyps and thus assumptions
;  forced in concl are context free and often impossible to prove.  Now
;  while the user might hide propositional structure in other functions
;  and thus still suffer this failure mode, IMPLIES is the most common
;  one and by opening it now we make our context clearer.  See the note
;  below for the reason we expand other
;  *expandable-boot-strap-non-rec-fns*.

; This is no longer true.  We now expand the IMPLIES from the original theorem
; in preprocess-clause before expand-abbreviations is called, and do not expand
; any others here.  These changes in the handling of IMPLIES (as well as
; several others) are caused by the introduction of assume-true-false-if.  See
; the mini-essay at assume-true-false-if.

; The problem was that the implies was not getting expanded (because
; the let turns into a lambda and the implication in the body is not
; an abbreviationp, as checked above).  So we decided that, in such
; cases, we would actually expand the abbreviations in the body
; without expanding the lambda itself, as we do below.  This in turn
; often allows the lambda to expand via the following mechanism.
; Preprocess-clause calls expand-abbreviations and it expands the
; implies into IFs in the body without opening the lambda.  But then
; preprocess-clause calls clausify-input which does another
; expand-abbreviations and this time the expansion is allowed.  We do
; not imagine that this change will adversely affect proofs, but if
; so, well, the old code is shown on the first line of this comment.

; The list above is an arbitrary subset of *expandable-boot-strap-non-rec-fns*.
; Once upon a time we used the entire list here, but Bishop Brock complained
; that he did not want EQL opened.  So we have limited the list to just the
; propositional function IFF and the no-ops.

; Note: Once upon a time we did not expand any propositional functions
; here.  Indeed, one might wonder why we do now?  The only place
; expand-abbreviations was called was from within preprocess-clause.
; And there, its output was run through clausify-input and then
; remove-trivial-clauses.  The latter called tautologyp on each clause
; and that, in turn, expanded all the functions above (but discarded
; the expansion except for purposes of determining tautologyhood).
; Thus, there is no real case to make against expanding these guys.
; For sanity, one might wish to keep the list above in sync with
; that in tautologyp, where we say about it: "The list is in fact
; *expandable-boot-strap-non-rec-fns* with NOT deleted and IFF added.
; The main idea here is to include non-rec functions that users
; typically put into the elegant statements of theorems."  But now we
; have deleted IMPLIES from this list, to support the assume-true-false-if
; idea, but we still keep IMPLIES in the list for tautologyp because
; if we can decide it's a tautology by expanding, all the better.

; Previous to Version_2.6 we had written:

; ; Note: Once upon a time (in Version 1.5) we called "clausify-clause-set" here.
; ; That function called clausify on each element of clauses and unioned the
; ; results together, in the process naturally deleting tautologies as does
; ; expand-some-non-rec-fns-in-clauses above.  But Version 1.5 caused Bishop a
; ; lot of pain because many theorems would explode into case analyses, each of
; ; which was then dispatched by simplification.  The reason we used a full-blown
; ; clausify in Version 1.5 was that in was also into that version that we
; ; introduced forcing rounds and the liberal use of force-flg = t.  But if we
; ; are to force that way, we must really get all of our hypotheses out into the
; ; open so that they can contribute to the type-alist stored in each assumption.
; ; For example, in Version 1.4 the concl of (IMPLIES hyps concl) was rewritten
; ; first without the hyps being manifest in the type-alist since IMPLIES is a
; ; function.  Not until the IMPLIES was opened did the hyps become "governors"
; ; in this sense.  In Version 1.5 we decided to throw caution to the wind and
; ; just clausify the clausified input.  Well, it bit us as mentioned above and
; ; we are now backing off to simply expanding the non-rec fns that might
; ; contribute hyps.  But we leave the expansions in place rather than normalize
; ; them out so that simplification has one shot on a small set (usually
; ; singleton set) of clauses.

; But the comment above is now irrelevant to the current situation.
; Before commenting on the current situation, however, we point out that
; in (admittedly light) testing the original call to
; expand-some-non-rec-fns-in-clauses in its original context acted as
; the identity.  This seems reasonable because 'iff and 'implies were
; expanded in expand-abbreviations.

; We now expand the 'implies from the original theorem (but not the
; implies from a :use hint) in the call to expand-any-final-implies.
; This performs the expansion whose motivations are mentioned in the
; old comments above, but does not interfere with the conclusions
; of a :use hint.  See the mini-essay

; In this case preprocess-clause has produced a singleton set of clauses whose
; only element is the translated user input.  For example, the user might have
; invoked defthm on (implies p q) and preprocess has managed to to produce the
; singleton set of clauses containing {(not p) q}.  This is a valuable step in
; the proof of course.  However, users complain when we report that (IMPLIES P
; Q) -- the displayed goal -- is reduced to (IMPLIES P Q) -- the
; prettyification of the output.

; We therefore take special steps to hide this transformation from the
; user without changing the flow of control through the waterfall.  In
; particular, we will insert into the ttree the tag
; 'hidden-clause with (irrelevant) value t.  In subsequent places
; where we print explanations and clauses to the user we will look for
; this tag.

; At one point we called prettyify-clause below instead of
; prettyify-clause-simple, and compared the (untranslated) result to the
; (untranslated) displayed-goal of the pspv.  But we have decided to avoid the
; expense of untranslating, especially since often the potentially-confusing
; printing will never take place!  Let's elaborate.  Suppose that the input
; user-level term t1 translates to termp tt1, and suppose that the result of
; preprocessing the clause set (list (list tt1)) is a single clause for which
; prettyify-clause-simple returns the (translated) term tt1.  Then we are in
; this case and we set 'hidden-clause in the returned ttree.  However, suppose
; that instead prettyify-clause-simple returns tt2 not equal to tt1, although
; tt2 nevertheless untranslates (perhaps surprisingly) to t1.  Then we are not
; in this case, and Goal' will print exactly as goal.  This is unfortunate, but
; we have seen (back in 2003!) that kind of invisible transformation happen for
; other than Goal:

;   Subgoal 3
;   (IMPLIES (AND (< I -1)
;                 (ACL2-NUMBERP J)
;                 ...)
;            ...)
;
;   By case analysis we reduce the conjecture to
;
;   Subgoal 3'
;   (IMPLIES (AND (< I -1)
;                 (ACL2-NUMBERP J)
;                 ...)
;            ...)

; As of this writing we do not handle this sort of situation, not even -- after
; Version_7.0, when we started using prettyify-clause-simple to avoid the cost
; of untranslation, instead of prettyify-clause -- for the case considered
; here, transitioning from Goal to Goal' by preprocess-clause.  Perhaps we will
; do such a check for all preprocess-clause transformations, but only when
; actually printing output (so as to avoid the overhead of untranslation).

; Before Version_2.6 we did not modify the tag-tree here.  The result was that

; 'accumulated-ttree in state, so these assumptions still reside there; but
; since that ttree is only used for reporting rules used and is intended to
; reflect the entire proof attempt, this decision seems reasonable.

; Version_2.6 was released on November 29, 2001.  On January 18, 2002, we

; with an example that is included after the definition of push-clause.  The
; problem turned out to be that we did not remove :use and :by tagged values
; from the tag-tree here.  The result was that if the early part of a
; successful proof attempt had involved a :use or :by hint but then the early
; part was thrown away and we reverted to the original goal, the :use or :by
; tagged value remained in the tag-tree.  When the proof ultimately succeeded,
; this tagged value was used to update (global-val
; 'proved-functional-instances-alist (w state)), which records proved
; constraints so that subsequent proofs can avoid proving them again.  But
; because the prover reverted to the original goal rather than taking advantage
; of the :use hint, those constraints were not actually proved in this case and
; might not be valid!

; So, we have decided that rather than remove assumptions and :by/:use tags
; from the :tag-tree of pspv, we would just replace that tag-tree by the empty
; tag-tree.  We do not want to get burned by a third such problem!

; Note: There is no apply-use-hint-clause.  We just call this function
; on a singleton list of clauses.

; Temp is the result of assoc-eq :use in a pspv :hint-settings and is
; non-nil.  We discuss its shape below.  But this function applies the
; given :use hint to each clause in clauses and returns (mv 'hit
; new-clauses ttree new-pspv).

; Temp is of the form (:USE lmi-lst (hyp1 ... hypn) constraint-cl k
; event-names new-entries) where each hypi is a theorem and
; constraint-cl is a clause that expresses the conjunction of all k
; constraints.  Lmi-lst is the list of lmis that generated these hyps.
; Constraint-cl is (probably) of the form {(if constr1 (if constr2 ...
; (if constrk t nil)... nil) nil)}.  We add each hypi as a hypothesis
; to each goal clause, cl, and in addition, create one new goal for
; each constraint.  Note that we discard the extended goal clause if
; it is a tautology.  Note too that the constraints generated by the
; production of the hyps are conjoined into a single clause in temp.
; But we hit that constraint-cl with preprocess-clause to pick out its
; (non-tautological) cases and that code will readily unpack the if
; structure of a typical conjunct.  We remove the :use hint from the
; hint-settings so we don't fire the same :use again on the subgoals.

; We return (mv new-step-limit 'hit new-clauses ttree new-pspv).

; The ttree returned has at most two tags.  The first is :use and has
; ((lmi-lst hyps constraint-cl k event-names new-entries)
; . non-tautp-applications) as its value, where non-tautp-applications
; is the number of non-tautologous clauses we got by adding the hypi
; to each clause.  However, it is possible the :use tag is not
; present: if clauses is nil, we don't report a :use.  The optional
; second tag is the ttree produced by preprocess-clause on the
; constraint-cl.  If the preprocess-clause is to be hidden anyway, we
; ignore its tree (but use its clauses).

; is a no-op unless there is a :use, :by, :cases, :bdd, :clause-processor, or
; :or hint in the :hint-settings of pspv.  If there is, we remove it and apply
; it.  By implementing these hints via this special-purpose processor we can
; take advantage of the waterfall's already-provided mechanisms for handling
; multiple clauses and output.

; We return five values.  The first is a new step-limit and the sixth is state.
; The second is a signal that is either 'hit, 'miss, or 'error.  When the
; signal is 'miss, the remaining three values are irrelevant.  When the signal
; is 'error, the third result is a pair of the form (str . alist) which allows
; us to give our caller an error message to print.  In this case, the remaining
; two values are irrelevant.  When the signal is 'hit, the third result is the
; list of new clauses, the fourth is a ttree that will become that component of
; the history-entry for this process, and the fifth is the modified pspv.

; We need cl-id passed in so that we can store it in the bddnote, in the case
; of a :bdd hint.

; NOTE: This function has not been called since Version_2.5.  However,
; we reference the comment below in a comment in settled-down-clause,
; so for now we keep this comment, if for no other other reason than
; historical.

; Context: We are about to print cl-id and clause in waterfall-msg.
; Then we will print the message associated with the first entry in
; hist, which is the entry for the processor which just hit clause and
; for whom we are reporting.  However, if the previous entry in the
; history was specious, then the cl-id and clause were printed when
; the specious hit occurred and we should not reprint them.  Thus, our
; job here is to decide whether the previous process in the history
; was specious.

; There are complications though, introduced by the existence of
; settled-down-clause.  In the first place, settled-down-clause ALWAYS
; produces a set of clauses containing the input clause and so ought
; to be considered specious every time it hits!  We avoid that in
; waterfall-step and never mark a settled-down-clause as specious, so
; we can assoc for them.  More problematically, consider the
; possibility that the first simplification -- the one before the
; clause settled down -- was specious.  Recall that the
; pre-settled-down-clause simplifications are weak.  Thus, it is
; imaginable that after settling down, other simplifications may
; happen and allow a non-specious simplification.  Thus,
; settled-down-clause actually does report its "hit" (and thus add its
; mark to the history so as to enable the subsequent simplify-clause
; to pull out the stops) following even specious simplifications.
; Thus, we must be prepared here to see a non-specious
; settled-down-clause which followed a specious simplification.

; Note: It is possible that the first entry on hist is specious.  That
; is, if the process on behalf of which we are about to print is in
; fact specious, it is so marked right now in the history.  But that
; is irrelevant to our question.  We don't care if the current guy
; specious, we want to know if his "predecessor" was.  For what it is
; worth, as of this writing, it is thought to be impossible for two
; adjacent history entries to be marked 'SPECIOUS.  Only
; simplify-clause, we think, can produce specious hits.  Whenever a
; specious simplify-clause occurs, it is treated as a 'miss and we go
; on to the next process, which is not simplify-clause.  Note that if
; elim could produce specious 'hits, then we might get two in a row.
; Observe also that it is possible for two successive simplifies to be
; specious, but that they are separated by a non-specious
; settled-down-clause.  (Our code doesn't rely on any of this, but it
; is sometimes helpful to be able to read such thoughts later as a
; hint of what we were thinking when we made some terrible coding
; mistake and so this might illuminate some error we're making today.)

; Section:  WATERFALL

; The waterfall is a simple finite state machine (whose individual
; state transitions are very complicated).  Abstractly, each state
; contains a "processor" and two neighbor states, the "hit" state and
; the "miss" state.  Roughly speaking, when we are in a state we apply
; its processor to the input clause and obtain either a "hit" signal
; (and some new clauses) or "miss" signal.  We then transit to the
; appropriate state and continue.

; However, the "hit" state for every state is that point in the falls,
; where 'apply-top-hints-clause is the processor.

; push-clause ----------------------------->+

; WARNING: Waterfall1-lst knows that 'preprocess-clause follows
; 'apply-top-hints-clause!

; We therefore represent a state s of the waterfall as a pair whose car
; is the processor for s and whose cdr is the miss state for s.  The hit
; state for every state is the constant state below, which includes, by
; successive cdrs, every state below it in the falls.

; Because the word "STATE" has a very different meaning in ACL2 than we have
; been using thus far in this discussion, we refer to the "states" of the
; waterfall as "ledges" and basically name them by the processors on each.

; Observe that the cdr of the 'simplify-clause ledge, for example, is the
; 'settled-down-clause ledge, etc.  That is, each ledge contains the
; ones below it.

; Note: To add a new processor to the waterfall you must add the
; appropriate entry to the *preprocess-clause-ledge* and redefine
; waterfall-step and waterfall-msg, below.

; If we are on ledge p with input cl and pspv, we apply processor p to
; our input and obtain signal, some cli, and pspv'.  If signal is
; 'abort, we stop and return pspv'.  If signal indicates a hit, we
; successively process each cli, starting each at the top ledge, and
; accumulating the successive pspvs starting from pspv'.  If any cli
; aborts, we abort; otherwise, we return the final pspv.  If signal is
; 'miss, we fall to the next lower ledge with cl and pspv.  If signal
; is 'error, we return abort and propagate the error message upwards.

; Before we resume development of the waterfall, we introduce functions in
; support of gag-mode.

; Parallelism wart: wormhole printing isn't reliable.  (When this wart is
; removed, then remove the references to it in
; unsupported-waterfall-parallelism-features and
; waterfall1-wrapper@par-before.)  We lock wormholes at a very high level, so
; we thought they might be thread safe.  However, in practice, when we enable
; printing through wormholes, there are problems symptomatic of race
; conditions.  We think these problems are related to the ld-special variables.
; Specifically, a thread tries to read from the prompt upon entering the
; wormhole, even if there isn't supposed to be any interaction with the prompt.
; A possible solution to this problem might involve implementing all of the
; ld-specials with global variables (as opposed to propsets), and then
; rebinding those global variables in each worker thread.  Long story short:
; wormholes might be thread-safe, but we have lots of reasons to believe they
; aren't.

; Therefore, we have different versions of the present macro for the
; #+acl2-loop-only and #-acl2-loop-only cases.  To see why, first note that
; waterfall-print-clause-id-fmt1-call does printing, hence returns state.  As
; such, the #+acl2-loop-only code (where state is not available) performs the
; printing inside a wormhole.  However, because of the parallelism wart above,
; we avoid the wormhole call in the #-acl2-loop-only case, which is the
; actually executed inside the prover.

; Note on Higher Order Definitions and the Inconvenience of ACL2:
; Later in these sources we will define the "mate and merge" function,
; m&m, which computes certain kinds of transitive closures.  We really
; wish we had that function now, because this function could use it
; for the bulk of this computation.  But we can't define it here
; without moving up some of the data structures associated with
; induction.  Rather than rip our code apart, we define a simple
; version of m&m that does the job.

; This suggests that we really ought to support the idea of defining a
; function before all of its subroutines are defined -- a feature that
; ultimately involves the possibility of implicit mutual recursion.

; It should also be noted that the problem with moving m&m is not so
; much with the code for the mate and merge process as it is with the
; pseudo functional argument it takes.  M&m naturally is a higher
; order function that compute the transitive closure of an operation
; supplied to it.  Because ACL2 is first order, our m&m doesn't really

; Part of disvaring a type-alist to is keep type-alist entries about
; constrained constants.  This goes to a problem that Eric Smith noted.
; He had constrained (thebit) to be 0 or 1 and had a type-alist entry
; stating that (thebit) was not 0.  In a forcing round he needed that
; (thebit) was 1.  But disvaring had thrown out of the type-alist the
; entry for (thebit) because it did not mention any of the relevant
; variables.  So, in a change for Version_2.7 we now keep entries that
; mention constrained constants.  We considered the idea of keeping
; entries that mention any constrained function, regardless of arity.
; But that seems like overkill.  Had Eric constrained (thebit x) to
; be 0 or 1 and then had a hypothesis that it was not 0, it seems
; unlikely that the forcing round would need to know (thebit x) is 1
; if x is not among the relevant vars.  That is, one assumes that if a
; constrained function has arguments then the function's behavior on
; those arguments does not determine the function's behavior on other
; arguments.  This need not be the case.  One can constrain (thebit x)
; so that if it is 0 on some x then it is 0 on all x.
; (implies (equal (thebit x) 0) (equal (thebit y) 0))
; But this seems unlikely.

; is some conjunct from a guard.  In many cases we expect term to be
; something very simple like (RATIONALP X).  But chances are high that
; type- alist talks about many other variables and many irrelevant
; terms.  We wish to throw out irrelevant bindings from type-alist and
; return a new type-alist that is weaker but, we believe, as
; sufficient as the original for proving term.  We call this
; ``unencumbering'' the type-alist.

; The following paragraph is inaccurate because we no longer use
; disguarding.

; Historical Comment:
; We apply two different techniques.  The first is ``disguarding.''
; Roughly, the idea is to throw out the binding of any term that
; requires the truth of term in its guard.  Since we are trying to
; prove term true we will assume it false.  If a hypothesis in the
; type-alist requires term to get past the guard, we'll never do it.
; This is not unlikely since term is (probably) a forced guard from
; the very clause from which type-alist was created.
; End of Historical Comment

; The second technique, applied after disguarding, is to throw out any
; binding of a term that is not linked to the variables used by term.
; For example, if term is (RATIONALP X) then we won't keep a
; hypothesis about (PRIMEP Y) unless some kept hypothesis links X and
; Y.  This is called ``disvaring'' and is applied after disguarding
; because the terms thrown out by disguarding are likely to link
; variables in a bogus way.  For example, (< X Y) would link X and Y,
; but is thrown out by disguarding since it requires (RATIONALP X).
; While disvaring, we actually keep type-alist entries about constrained
; constants.

(defun dumb-type-alist-implicationp (type-alist1 type-alist2)

; NOTE: This function is intended to be dumb but fast.  One can
; imagine that we should be concerned with the types deduced by
; type-set under these type-alists.  For example, instead of asking
; whether every term bound in type-alist1 is bound to a bigger type
; set in type-alist2, we should perhaps ask whether the term has a
; bigger type-set under type-alist2.  Similarly, if we find a term
; bound in type-alist2 we should make sure that its type-set under
; type-alist1 is smaller.  If we need the smarter function we'll write
; it.  That's why we call this one "dumb."

; We say type-alist1 implies type-alist2 if (1) for every
; "significant" entry in type-alist1, (term ts1 . ttree1) it is the
; case that either term is not bound in type-alist2 or term is bound
; to some ts2 in type-alist2 and (ts-subsetp ts1 ts2), and (2) every
; term bound in type-alist2 is bound in type-alist1.  The case where
; term is not bound in type-alist2 can be seen as the natural
; treatment of the equivalent situation in which term is bound to
; *ts-unknown* in type-set2.  An entry (term ts . ttree) is
; "significant" if it is the first binding of term in the alist.

; We can treat a type-alist as a conjunction of assumptions about the
; terms it binds.  Each relevant entry gives rise to an assumption
; about its term.  Call the conjunction the "assumptions" encoded in
; the type-alist.  If type-alist1 implies type-alist2 then the
; assumptions of the first imply those of the second.  Consider an
; assumption of the first.  It restricts its term to some type.  But
; the corresponding assumption about term in the second type-alist
; restricts term to a larger type.  Thus, each assumption of the first
; type-alist implies the corresponding assumption of the second.

; The end result of all of this is that if you need to prove some
; condition, say g, under type-alist1 and also under type-alist2, and
; you can determine that type-alist1 implies type-alist2, then it is
; sufficient to prove g under type-alist2.

; Here is an example.  Let type-alist1 be
;   ((x *ts-t*)      (y *ts-integer*) (z *ts-symbol*))
; and type-alist2 be
;   ((x *ts-boolean*)(y *ts-rational*)).

; Observe that type-alist1 implies type-alist2: *ts-t* is a subset of
; *ts- boolean*, *ts-integer* is a subset of *ts-rational*, and
; *ts-symbol* is a subset of *ts-unknown*, and there are no terms
; bound in type-alist2 that aren't bound in type-alist1.  If we needed
; to prove g under both of these type-alists, it would suffice to
; prove it under type-alist2 (the weaker) because we must ultimately
; prove g under type-alist2 and the proof of g under type-alist1
; follows from that for free.

; Observe also that if we added to type-alist2 the binding (u
; *ts-cons*) then condition (1) of our definition still holds but (2)
; does not.  Further, if we mistakenly regarded type-alist2 as the
; weaker then proving (consp u) under type-alist2 would not ensure a
; proof of (consp u) under type-alist1.

; WARNING: This function is overloaded.  Only-immediatep can take only only two
; values in this function: 'non-nil or nil.  The interpretation is as in
; collect-assumptions.  Cl is irrelevant if only-immediatep is nil.  We always
; return four results.  But when only-immediatep = 'non-nil, the first and part
; of the third result are irrelevant.  We know that only-immediatep = 'non-nil
; is used only in waterfall-step to do CASE-SPLITs and immediate FORCEs.  We
; know that only-immediatep = nil is used for forcing-round applications and in
; the proof-builder.  When CASE-SPLIT type assumptions are collected with
; only-immediatep = nil, then they are given the semantics of FORCE rather
; than CASE-SPLIT.  This could happen in the proof-builder, but it is thought
; not to happen otherwise.

; In the case that only-immediatep is nil: we strip all assumptions out of
; ttree, obtaining an assumption-free ttree, ttree'.  We then cleanup the
; assumptions, by removing subsumed ones.  (Formerly we also unencumbered their
; type-alists of presumed irrelevant bindings first, but we no longer do so;
; see unencumber-assumption.)  We then convert each kept assumption into a
; clause encoding the implication from the cleaned up type-alist to the
; assumed term.  We pair each clause with the :assumnotes of the assumptions
; for which it accounts, to produce a list of pairs, which is among the things
; we return.  Each pair is of the form (assumnotes . clause).  We return four
; results, (mv n a pairs ttree'), where n is the number of assumptions in the
; tree, a is the cleaned up assumptions we have to prove, whose length is the
; same as the length of pairs.

; In the case that only-immediatep is 'non-nil: we strip out of ttree only
; those assumptions with non-nil :immediatep flags.  As before, we generate a
; clause for each, but those with :immediatep = 'case-split we handle
; differently now: the clause for such an assumption is the one that encodes
; the implication from the negation of cl to the assumed term, rather than the
; one involving the type-alist of the assumption.  The assumnotes paired with
; such a clause is nil.  We do not really care about the assumnotes in
; case-splits or immediatep = t cases (e.g., they are ignored by the
; waterfall-step processing).  The final ttree, ttree', may still contain
; non-immediatep assumptions.

; To keep the definition simpler, we split into just the two cases outlined

; The obvious example of apparently specious behavior by
; apply-top-hints-clause that is not really specious is when it signals
; an OR-HIT and returns the input clause (to be processed by further hints).
; But the inclusion of apply-top-hints-clause in this list of exceptions
; was originally made in Version_2.7 because of :by hints.  Consider
; what happens when a :by hint produces a subgoal that is identical to the
; current goal.  If the subgoal is labeled as 'SPECIOUS, then we will 'MISS
; below.  This was causing the waterfall to apply the :by hint a second time,
; resulting in output such as the following:

;  As indicated by the hint, this goal is subsumed by (EQUAL (F1 X) (F0 X)),
;  which can be derived from LEMMA1 via functional instantiation, provided
;  we can establish the constraint generated.

;  As indicated by the hint, this goal is subsumed by (EQUAL (F1 X) (F0 X)),

; The following example reproduces the above output.  The top-level hints

; Processor is one of the known waterfall processors.  This function applies
; processor and returns seven results: step-limit, signal, clauses, new-hist,
; new-pspv, jppl-flg, and state.

; All processor functions take as input a clause, its hist, a pspv, wrld, and
; state.  They all deliver four values (but apply-top-hints-clause,
; preprocess-clause, and simplify-clause also take a step-limit input and
; deliver a new step-limit as an additional value, in the first position): a
; signal, some clauses, a ttree, and a new pspv.  The signal delivered by such
; processors is one of 'error, 'miss, 'abort, or else indicates a "hit" via the
; signals 'hit, 'hit-rewrite, 'hit-rewrite2 and 'or-hit.  We identify the first
; three kinds of hits.  'Or-hits indicate that a set of disjunctive branches
; has been produced.

; If the returned signal is 'error or 'miss, we immediately return with that
; signal.  But if the signal is a "hit" or 'abort (which in this context means
; "the processor did something but it has demanded the cessation of the
; waterfall process"), we add a new history entry to hist, store the ttree into
; the new pspv, print the message associated with this processor, and then
; return.

; When a processor "hit"s, we check whether it is a specious hit, i.e., whether
; the input is a member of the output.  If so, the history entry for the hit is
; marked specious by having the :processor field '(SPECIOUS . processor).
; However, we report the step as a 'miss, passing back the extended history to
; be passed.  Specious processors have to be recorded in the history so that
; waterfall-msg can detect that they have occurred and not reprint the formula.
; Mild Retraction: Actually, settled-down-clause always produces
; specious-appearing output but we never mark it as 'SPECIOUS because we want
; to be able to assoc for settled-down-clause and we know it's specious anyway.

; We typically return (mv step-limit signal clauses new-hist new-pspv jppl-flg
; state).

; Signal             Meaning

; 'error         Halt the entire proof attempt with an error.  We
;                print out the error message to the returned state.
;                In this case, clauses, new-hist, new-pspv, and jppl-flg
;                are all irrelevant (and nil).

; 'miss          The processor did not apply or was specious.  Clauses,
;                and jppl-flg are irrelevant and nil, but new-hist has the
;                specious processor recorded in it, and new-pspv records
;                rw-cache modifications to the :tag-tree of the input pspv.
;                State is unchanged.

; 'abort         Like a "hit", except that we are not to continue with
;                the waterfall.  We are to use the new pspv as the
;                final pspv produced by the waterfall.

; 'hit           The processor applied and produced the new set of
; 'hit-rewrite   clauses returned.  The appropriate new history and
; 'hit-rewrite2  new pspv are returned.  Jppl-flg is either nil
;                (indicating that the processor was not push-clause)
;                or is a pool lst (indicating that a clause was pushed
;                and assigned that lst).  The jppl-flg of the last executed
;                processor should find its way out of the waterfall so
;                that when we get out and pop a clause we know if we
;                just pushed it.  Finally, the message describing the
;                transformation has been printed to state.

; 'or-hit        The processor applied and has requested a disjunctive
;                split determined by hints.  The results are actually
;                the same as for 'hit.  The processor did not actually
;                produce the case split because some of the hints
;                (e.g., :in-theory) are related to the environment
;                in which we are to process the clause rather than the

; Section:  FIND-APPLICABLE-HINT-SETTINGS

; Here we develop the code that recognizes that some user-supplied
; hint settings are applicable and we develop the routine to use
; hints.  It all comes together in waterfall1.

(defun@par find-applicable-hint-settings1
  (cl-id clause hist pspv ctx hints hints0 wrld stable-under-simplificationp
         override-hints state)

; See translate-hints1 for "A note on the taxonomy of translated hints", which
; explains hint settings.  Relevant background is also provided by :doc topic
; hints-and-the-waterfall, which links to :doc override-hints (also providing
; relevant background).

; We scan down hints looking for the first one that matches cl-id and clause.
; If we find none, we return nil.  Otherwise, we return a pair consisting of
; the corresponding hint-settings and hints0 modified as directed by the hint
; that was applied.  By "match" here, of course, we mean either

; (a) the hint is of the form (cl-id . hint-settings), or

; (b) the hint is of the form (eval-and-translate-hint-expression name-tree flg
; term) where term evaluates to a non-erroneous non-nil value when ID is bound
; to cl-id, CLAUSE to clause, WORLD to wrld, STABLE-UNDER-SIMPLIFICATIONP to
; stable-under-simplificationp, HIST to hist, PSPV to pspv, CTX to ctx, and
; STATE to state.  In this case the corresponding hint-settings is the
; translated version of what the term produced.  We know that term is
; single-threaded in state and returns an error triple.

; This function is responsible for interpreting computed hints, including the
; meaning of the :computed-hint-replacement keyword.  It also deals
; appropriately with override-hints.  Note that override-hints is
; (override-hints wrld).

; Stable-under-simplificationp is t when the clause has been found not to
; change when simplified.  In particular, it is t if we are about to transition
; to destructor elimination.

; Optimization: By convention, when this function is called with
; stable-under-simplificationp = t, we know that the function returned nil when
; called earlier with the change: stable-under-simplificationp = nil.  That is,
; if we know the clause is stable under simplification, then we have already
; tried and failed to find an applicable hint for it before we knew it was
; stable.  So when stable-under-simplificationp is t, we avoid some work and
; just eval those hints that might be sensitive to
; stable-under-simplificationp.  The flg component of (b)-style hints indicates
; whether the term contains the free variable stable-under-simplificationp.

; Essay on OR-HIT Messages

; When we generate an OR-HIT, we print a message saying it has
; happened and that we will sweep across the disjuncts and consider
; each in turn.  That message is printed in
; apply-top-hints-clause-msg1.

; As we sweep, we print three kinds of messages:
; a:  ``here is the next disjunct to consider''
; b:  ``this disjunct has succeeded and we won't consider the others''
; c:  ``we've finished the sweep and now we choose the best result''

; Each is printed by a waterfall-or-hit-msg- function, labeled a, b,
; or c.

; Background: An :OR hint takes a list of n translated hint settings,
; at a clause with a clause id.  It essentially copies the clause n
; times, gives it a new clause id (with a "Dk" suffix), and arranges
; for the waterfall to apply each hint settings to one such copy of
; the clause.  The way it arranges that is to change the hints in the
; pspv so that the newly generated "Dk" clause ids are paired with
; their respective hints.  But computed hints are different!  A
; computed hint isn't paired with a clause id.  It has it built into
; the form somewhere.  Now generally the user created the form and we
; assume the user saw the subgoal with the "Dk" id of interest and
; entered it into his form.  But we generate some computed hint forms
; -- namely custom keyword hints.  And we're responsible for tracking
; the new clause ids to which they apply.

; Hint-settings is a translated hint-settings.  That is, it is either
; a dotted alist pairing common hint keywords to their translated
; values or it is a computed hint form starting with
; eval-and-translate-hint-expression.  In the former case, we produce

; Parallelism blemish: Kaufmann suggests that we need to skip printing
; clause-ids that have already been printed.  Note that using the printing of
; clause-ids to show that the prover is still making progress is no longer the
; default setting (see :doc set-waterfall-printing).  This is a low-priority
; blemish, because as of 2012-07, the main ACL2 users use the :very-limited
; setting for waterfall-printing -- this setting only prints periods, not
; clause-ids.  Example:

;   (set-waterfall-parallelism :pseudo-parallel)
;   (set-waterfall-printing :limited)
;   (thm (implies (equal x y) (equal u v)))

; Parallelism blemish: here, and at many other ACL2(p)-specific places, consider
; using observation-cw or printing that can be inhibited, instead of cw.  We
; have not tried this so far because observation-cw calls wormhole, which is
; problematic (see the comment in waterfall-print-clause-id@par).

; and is one of 'abort, 'error, or 'continue.  The last three returned values
; are the final values of pspv, the jppl-flg for this trip through the falls,
; and state.  The 'abort signal is used by our recursive processing to
; implement aborts from below.  When an abort occurs, the clause processor that

; Keep the main body of waterfall1-lst in sync with waterfall1-lst@par-serial,
; waterfall1-tree@par-parallel, and waterfall1-tree@par-pseudo-parallel.  Keep
; the calculation of cl-id in sync with waterfall1-lst@par.

; Once upon a time, we took a "list-based" approach to parallelizing the proofs
; of clauses.  We now take a "tree-based" approach.

; Originally waterfall1-tree@par-parallel would "cdr" down the list of clauses
; and spawn a thread for each of those recursive calls.  However, that approach
; required too many threads (we attempted to mitigate this problem with
; set-total-parallelism-work-limit, but it was just a bandage on a more glaring
; problem).  As of April, 2012, we now take a "tree-based" approach and split
; the list of clauses into halves, and then call waterfall1-lst@par again,
; twice, each with its own half.  We eventually call waterfall1-lst@par with a
; clause list of length 1, and then that clause is proven.

; Note that splitting the list like this is a reasonable thing to do -- we do
; not reorder any subgoals, and we increment the variable that keeps track of
; the current subgoal number (n) by the length of the first half of clauses.

; This function is called only when a proof attempt causes an error rather than
; merely returning (mv non-nil val state); see prove-loop0.  We formerly called
; this function pstack-and-gag-state, but now we also print the runes, and
; perhaps we will print additional information in the future.

; An alternative approach, which might avoid the need for this function, is
; represented by the handling of *acl2-time-limit* in our-abort.  The idea
; would be to continue automatically from the interrupt, but with a flag saying
; that the proof should terminate immediately.  Then any proof procedure that
; checks for this flag would return with some sort of error.  If no such proof
; procedure is invoked, then a second interrupt would immediately take effect.
; An advantage of such an alternative approach is that it would use a normal
; control flow, updating suitable state globals so that a normal call of
; print-summary could be made.  We choose, however, not to pursue this
; approach, since it might risk annoying users who find that they need to
; provide two interrupts, and because it seems inherently a bit tricky and
; perhaps easy to get wrong.

; We conclude with remarks for the case that waterfall parallelism is enabled.

; When the user has to interrupt a proof twice before it quits, the prover will
; call this function.  Based on observation by Rager, the pstack tends to be
; long and irrelevant in this case.  So, we disable the printing of the pstack
; when waterfall parallelism is enabled and waterfall-printing is something
; other than :full.  We considered not involving the current value for
; waterfall-printing, but using the :full setting is a strange thing to begin
; with.  So, we make the decision that if a user goes to the effort to use the
; :full waterfall-printing mode, that maybe they'd like to see the pstack after
; all.

; The below #+acl2-par change in definition also results in not printing
; gag-state under these conditions.  However, this is effectively a no-op,
; because the parallel waterfall does not save anything to gag-state anyway.

; Commemorative Plaque:

; We began the creation of the ACL2 with an empty GNU Emacs buffer on
; August 14, 1989.  The first few days were spent writing down the
; axioms for the most primitive functions.  We then began writing
; experimental applicative code for macros such as cond and
; case-match.  The first weeks were dizzying because of the confusion
; in our minds over what was in the logic and what was in the
; implementation.  On November 3, 1989, prove was debugged and
; successfully did the associativity of append.  During that 82 days
; we worked our more or less normal 8 hours, plus an hour or two on
; weekday nights.  In general we did not work weekends, though there
; might have been two or three where an 8 hour day was put in.  We
; worked separately, "contracting" with one another to do the various
; parts and meeting to go over the code.  Bill Schelter was extremely
; helpful in tuning akcl for us.  Several times we did massive
; rewrites as we changed the subset or discovered new programming
; styles.  During that period Moore went to the beach at Rockport one
; weekend, to Carlsbad Caverns for Labor Day, to the University of
; Utah for a 4 day visit, and to MIT for a 4 day visit.  Boyer taught
; at UT from September onwards.  These details are given primarily to
; provide a measure of how much effort it was to produce this system.
; In all, perhaps we have spent 60 8 hour days each on ACL2, or about
; 1000 man hours.  That of course ignores totally the fact that we
; have thought about little else during the past three months, whether
; coding or not.

; The system as it stood November 3, 1989, contained the complete
; nqthm rewriter and simplifier (including metafunctions, compound
; recognizers, linear and a trivial cut at congruence relations that
; did not connect to the user-interface) and induction.  It did not
; include destructor elimination, cross-fertilization, generalization
; or the elimination of irrelevance.  It did not contain any notion of
; hints or disabledp.  The system contained full fledged
; implementations of the definitional principle (with guards and
; termination proofs) and defaxiom (which contains all of the code to
; generate and store rules).  The system did not contain the
; constraint or functional instantiation events or books.  We have not
; yet had a "code walk" in which we jointly look at every line.  There
; are known bugs in prove (e.g., induction causes a hard error when no
; candidates are found).

; Matt Kaufmann officially joined the project in August, 1993.  He had
; previously generated a large number of comments, engaged in a number of
; design discussions, and written some code.

; Bob Boyer requested that he be removed as a co-author of ACL2 in April, 1995,
; because, in his view, he has worked so much less on the project in the last
; few years than Kaufmann and Moore.

; End of Commemorative Plaque

; This function increments timers.  Upon entry, the accumulated time is
