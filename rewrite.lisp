; Essay on Equivalence, Refinements, and Congruence-based Rewriting

; (Note: At the moment, the fact that fn is an equivalence relation is encoded
; merely by existence of a non-nil 'coarsenings property.  No :equivalence rune
; explaining why fn is an equivalence relation is to be found there -- though
; such a rune does exist and is indeed found among the 'congruences of fn
; itself.  We do not track the use of equivalence relations, we just use them
; anonymously.  It would be good to track them and report them.  When we do
; that, read the Note on Tracking Equivalence Runes in subst-type-alist1.)

; (Note: Some of the parenthetical remarks in this code are extremely trite
; observations -- to the ACL2 aficionado -- added when I sent this commented
; code off to friends to read.)

; We will allow the user to introduce new equivalence relations.  At the
; moment, they must be functions of two arguments only.  Parameterized
; equivalence relations, e.g., x == y (mod n), are interesting and may
; eventually be implemented.  But in the spirit of getting something done right
; and working, we start simple.

; An equivalence relation here is any two argument function that has been
; proved to be Boolean, symmetric, reflexive, and transitive.  The rule-class
; :EQUIVALENCE indicates that a given theorem establishes that equiv is an
; equivalence relation.  (In the tradition of Nqthm, the ACL2 user tells the
; system how to use a theorem when the theorem is submitted by the user.  These
; instructions are called "rule classes".  A typical "event" might therefore
; be:
; (defthm set-equal-is-an-equivalence-rel
;   (and (booleanp (set-equal x y))
;        (set-equal x x)
;        (implies (set-equal x y) (set-equal y x))
;        (implies (and (set-equal x y)
;                      (set-equal y z))
;                 (set-equal x z)))
;   :rule-classes :EQUIVALENCE)
; The rule class :EQUIVALENCE just alerts the system that this formula states
; that something is an equivalence relation.  If the formula is proved, the
; system identifies set-equal as the relation and adds to the database certain
; information that enables the processing described here.)

; The Boolean requirement is imposed for coding convenience.  In
; assume-true-false, for example, when we assume (equiv x y) true, we simply
; give it the type-set *ts-t*, rather than something complicated like its full
; type-set take away *ts-nil*.  In addition, the Boolean requirement means that
; (equiv x y) is equal to (equiv y x) (not just propositionally) and hence we
; can commute it at will.  The other three requirements are the classic ones
; for an equivalence relation.  All three are exploited.  Symmetry is used to
; justify commutativity, which currently shows up in assume-true-false when we
; put either (equiv x y) or (equiv y x) on the type-alist -- depending on
; term-order -- and rely on it to assign the value of either.  Reflexivity is
; used to eliminate (equiv x term) as a hypothesis when x does not occur in
; term or elsewhere in the clause.  Transitivity is used throughout the
; rewriting process.  These are not guaranteed to be all the places these
; properties are used!

; Note: Some thought has been given to the idea of generalizing our work to
; non-symmetric reflexive and transitive relations.  We have seen occasional
; utility for the idea of rewriting with such a monotonic relation, replacing a
; term by a stronger or more defined one.  But to implement that we feel it
; should be done in a completely independent second pass in which monotonic
; relations are considered.  Equivalence relations are of such importance that
; we did not want to risk doing them weakly just to allow this esoteric
; variant.

; Note: We explicitly check that an equivalence relation has no guard because
; we never otherwise consider their guards.  (The "guard" on an ACL2 function
; can be thought of as a "precondition" or a characterization of the domain of
; the function definition.  In Common Lisp many functions, e.g., car and cdr,
; are not defined everywhere and guards are our way of taking note of this.
; Equivalence relations have "no" guard, meaning their guard is t, i.e., they
; are defined everywhere.)

; The motivation behind equivalence relations is to allow their use as :REWRITE
; rules.  For example, after set-equal has been proved to be an equivalence
; relation and union-eq, say, has been proved to be commutative (wrt
; set-equal),

; (implies (and (symbol-listp a)
;               (true-listp a)
;               (symbol-listp b)
;               (true-listp b))
;          (set-equal (union-eq a b) (union-eq b a)))

; then we would like to be able to use the above rule as a rewrite rule to
; commute union-eq expressions.  Of course, this is only allowed in situations
; in which it is sufficient to maintain set-equality as we rewrite.  Implicit
; in this remark is the idea that the rewriter is given an equivalence relation
; to maintain as it rewrites.  This is a generalization of id/iff flag in
; Nqthm's rewriter; that flag indicates whether the rewriter is maintaining
; identity or propositional equivalence.  :CONGRUENCE lemmas, discussed later,
; inform the rewriter of the appropriate relations to maintain as it steps from
; (fn a1 ... an) to the ai.  But given a relation to maintain and a term to
; rewrite, the rewriter looks at all the :REWRITE rules available and applies
; those that maintain the given relation.

; For example, suppose the rewriter is working on (memb x (union-eq b a)),
; where memb is a function that returns t or nil according to whether its first
; argument is an element of its second.  Suppose the rewriter is to maintain
; identity during this rewrite, i.e., it is to maintain the equivalence
; relation equal.  Suppose a :CONGRUENCE rule informs us that equal can be
; preserved on memb expressions by maintaining set-equal on the second
; argument.  Then when rewriting the second argument to the memb, rewrite
; shifts from maintaining equal to maintaining set-equal.  This enables it to
; use the above theorem as a rewrite rule, replacing (union-eq b a) by
; (union-eq a b), just as Nqthm would had the connecting relation been equal
; instead of set-equal.

; This raises the problem of refinements.  For example, we may have some rules
; about union-eq that are expressed with equal rather than set-equal.  For
; example, the definition of union-eq is an equality!  It is clear that a rule
; may be tried if its connecting equivalence relation is a refinement of the
; one we wish to maintain.  By ``equiv1 is a refinement of equiv2'' we mean

; (implies (equiv1 x y) (equiv2 x y)).

; Such rules are called :REFINEMENT rules and are a distinguished rule-class,
; named :REFINEMENT.  Every equivalence relation is a refinement of itself.
; Equal is a refinement of every equivalence relation and no other relation is
; a refinement of equal.

; Every equivalence relation, fn, has a non-nil value for the property
; 'coarsenings.  The value of the property is a list of all equivalence
; relations (including fn itself) known to admit fn as a refinement.  This list
; is always closed under the transitivity of refinement.  That is, if e1 is a
; refinement of e2 and e2 is a refinement of e3, then the 'coarsenings for e1
; includes e1 (itself), e2 (of course), and e3 (surprise!).  This makes it
; easier to answer quickly the question of who is a refinement of whom.

; Equivalence relations are the only symbols with non-nil 'coarsenings
; properties, thus this is the way they are recognized.  Furthermore, the
; 'coarsenings property of 'equal will always list all known equivalence
; relations.

; When we are rewriting to maintain equiv we use any rule that is a known
; refinement of equiv.  Thus, while rewriting to maintain set-equal we can use
; both set-equal rules and equal rules.

; Now we move on to the heart of the matter: knowing what relation to maintain
; at each step.  This is where :CONGRUENCE rules come in.

; To understand the key idea in congruence-based rewriting, consider lemmas of
; the form

; (implies (equiv1 x y)
;          (equiv2 (fn a1 ... x ... an)
;                  (fn a1 ... y ... an))),

; where equiv1 and equiv2 are equivalence relations, the ai, x, and y are
; distinct variables and x and y occur in the kth argument position of the
; n-ary function fn.  These lemmas can be used to rewrite fn-expressions,
; maintaining equiv2, by rewriting the kth argument position maintaining
; equiv1.  In the separate Essay on Patterned Congruences and Equivalences we
; generalize to what we call "patterned congruence rules", but in this Essay we
; focus only on lemmas of the form above.

; We call such a lemma a ``congruence lemma'' and say that it establishes that
; ``equiv2 is maintained by equiv1 in the kth argument of fn.''  The rule-class
; :CONGRUENCE indicates when a lemma is to be so used.

; An example :CONGRUENCE lemma is

; (implies (set-equal a b) (iff (member x a) (member x b))).

; (In my previous example I used memb.  Here I use member, the Common Lisp
; function.  When member succeeds, it returns the tail of its second arg that
; starts with its first.  Thus, (member x a) is not necessary equal to (member
; x b), even when a and b are set-equal.  But they are propositionally
; equivalent, i.e., mutually nil or non-nil.  Iff is just another equivalence
; relation.)

; That is, iff is maintained by set-equal in the second argument of member.
; Thus, when rewriting a member expression while trying to maintain iff it is
; sufficient merely to maintain set-equivalence on the second argument of
; member.  In general we will sweep across the arguments of a function
; maintaining an appropriate equivalence relation for each argument as a
; function of the relation we wish to maintain outside.

; A literal interpretation of the lemma above suggests that one must maintain
; identity on the first argument of member in order to rely on the lemma in the
; second argument.  What then justifies our independent use of :CONGRUENCE
; lemmas in distinct argument positions?

; Congruence Theorem 1.  :CONGRUENCE lemmas for different argument positions of
; the same function can be used independently.  In particular, suppose equiv is
; maintained by e1 in the kth argument of fn and equiv is maintained by e2 in
; the jth argument of fn, where j is not k.  Suppose a is e1 to a' and b is e2
; to b'.  Then (fn ...a...b...) is equiv to (fn ...a'...b'...), where a and b
; occur in the kth and jth arguments, respectively.

; Proof.  By the :CONGRUENCE lemma for equiv and e1 we know that (fn
; ...a...b...) is equiv (fn ...a'...b...).  By the :CONGRUENCE lemma for equiv
; and e2 we know that (fn ...a'...b...) is equiv to (fn ...a'...b'...).  The
; desired result is then obtained via the transitivity of equiv.  Q.E.D.

; Again, we are not considering patterned congruences in the present Essay.
; For the proof above it is important that in the :CONGRUENCE lemma, each
; argument of a call of fn is a distinct variable.

; While we require the user to formulate (non-patterned) :CONGRUENCE lemmas as
; shown above we actually store them in a data structure, called the
; 'congruences property of fn, in which lemmas for different slots have been
; combined.  Indeed, we ``generalize'' still further and allow for more than
; one way to rewrite a given argument position.  If fn has arity n, then the
; 'congruences property of fn is a list of tuples, each of which is of the form
; (equiv slot1 slot2 ... slotn), where equiv is some equivalence relation and
; each slotk summarizes our knowledge of what is allowed in each argument slot
; of fn while maintaining equiv.  The entire n+1 tuple is assembled from many
; different :CONGRUENCE lemmas.  Indeed, it is modified each time a new
; :CONGRUENCE lemma is proved about fn and equiv.  Without discussing yet the
; structure of slotk, such a tuple means:

; (implies (and (or (equiv1.1 x1 y1)
;                   ...
;                   (equiv1.i x1 y1))
;               ...
;               (or (equivn.1 xn yn)
;                   ...
;                   (equivn.j xn yn)))
;          (equiv (fn x1 ... xn)
;                 (fn y1 ... yn))).

; Thus, to rewrite (fn x1 ... xn) maintaining equiv we sweep across the
; arguments rewriting each in turn, maintaining any one of the corresponding
; equivk.l's, which are encoded in the structure of slotk.

; Note that each equivk,l above is attributable to one and only one :CONGRUENCE
; lemma.  Since the ors cause searching, we allow the user to control the
; search by disabling :CONGRUENCE lemmas.  We only pursue paths introduced by
; enabled lemmas.

; The structure of slotk is a list of ``congruence-rules'', which are instances
; of the following record.

(defrec congruence-rule (nume equiv . rune) t)

; The :equiv field is the function symbol of an equivalence relation which, if
; maintained in argument k, is sufficient to maintain equiv for the
; fn-expression; :rune (it stands for "rule name") is the name of the
; :CONGRUENCE lemma that established this link between equiv, :equiv, fn, and
; k; and :nume is the nume of the rune (a "nume" is a unique natural number
; corresponding to a rune, used only to speed up the answer to the question:
; "is the named rule enabled -- i.e., among those the user permits us to apply
; automatically?"), allowing us to query the enabled structure directly.

; Because we allow more than one :CONGRUENCE rule per argument, we have a
; problem.  If we are trying to maintain equiv for fn and are rewriting an
; argument whose slot contains (equivk.1 ... equivk.l), what equivalence
; relation do we try to maintain while rewriting the argument?  We could
; iteratively try them each, rewriting the argument l times.  This suffers
; because some rules would be tried many times due to our use of refinements.
; For example, all of the equality rules would be tried for each equivk.i
; tried.

; It is desirable to eliminate the need for more than one pass through rewrite.
; We would like to rewrite once.  But if we pass the whole set in, with the
; understanding that any refinement of any of them can be used, we are not
; assured that the result of rewrite is equivalent in any of those senses to
; the input.  The reason is that rewrite may recursively rewrite its
; intermediate answer.  (If our rewriter simplifies a to a' it may then rewrite
; a' to a''.)  Thus, a may rewrite to a' maintaining equivk.1 and then a' may
; rewrite to a'' maintaining equivk.2 and it may be that a is not equivalent to
; a'' in either the equivk.1 or equivk.2 sense.  However, note that there
; exists an equivalence relation of which equivk.1 and equivk.2 are
; refinements, and that is the relation being maintained.  Call that the
; ``generated relation.''  Numerous questions arise.  Is the generated relation
; definable in the logic, for if so, perhaps we could allow only one
; equivalence relation per slot per fn and equiv and force the user to invent
; the necessary generalization of the several relations he wants to use.
; Furthermore, if both equivk.1 and equivk.2 maintain equiv in the kth slot of
; fn, does their generated relation maintain it?  We need to know that the
; answer is ``yes'' if we are going to replace a by a'' (which are equivalent
; only in the generated sense) and still maintain the goal relation.

; We have taken the tack of allowing more than one :CONGRUENCE rule per slot by
; automatically (indeed, implicitly) dealing with the generated equivalence
; relations.  To justify our code, we need a variety of theorems about
; generated relations.  We state and prove those now.

; Let e1 and e2 be two binary relations.  We define the relation s ``generated
; by e1 and e2,'' denoted {e1 e2}, as follows.  Because order is unimportant
; below, our set notation {e1 e2} is acceptable.

; (s x y) iff there exists a finite sequence x1, x2, ..., xn such that x = x1,
; y = xn, and for all i, ((e1 xi xi+1) or (e2 xi xi+1)).  We read this as
; saying ``(s x y) iff there is a chain connecting x to y composed entirely of
; e1 and/or e2 links.''

; Congruence Theorem 2. If e1 and e2 are equivalence relations, so is {e1 e2}.

; Proof.  Let s be {e1 e2}.  Then s is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, as
; shown below.

; Reflexive.  To show that (s x x) holds we must exhibit a sequence linking x
; to x via e1 and/or e2.  The sequence x,x suffices.

; Symmetric.  If (s x y) holds, then there exists a sequence linking x to y via
; e1 and/or e2 steps.  Let that sequence be x, x2, ..., xk, y.  By definition,
; either e1 or e2 links each pair.  Since e1 is symmetric, if a pair, xi, xj,
; is linked by e1 then the pair xj, xi is also linked by e1.  Similarly for e2.
; Thus, the sequence obtained by reversing that above, y, xk, ..., x2, x, has
; the desired property: each pair is linked by e1 or e2.  Therefore, (s y x).

; Transitive.  If (s x y) holds, then there exists a sequence linking x to y,
; say x, x2, ..., xk, y.  If (s y z) holds, there exists a sequence linking y
; to z, say, y, y1, ..., yk, z.  Consider the concatenation of those two
; sequences, x, x2, ..., xk, y, y, y1, ..., yk, z.  It links x and z and every
; pair is linked by either e1 or e2.  Thus, (s x z).

; Q.E.D.

; Thus, the relation generated by two equivalence relations is an equivalence
; relation.

; Congruence Theorem 3. If e1 and e2 are equivalence relations, they are both
; refinements of {e1 e2}.

; Proof.  Let s be {e1 e2}.  We wish to prove (implies (e1 x y) (s x y)) and
; (implies (e2 x y) (s x y)).  We consider the first goal only.  The second is
; symmetric.  But clearly, if x is linked to y by e1 then (s x y) holds, as
; witnessed by the sequence x,y.  Q.E.D.

; Congruence Theorem 4.  Let equiv, e1 and e2 be equivalence relations.
; Suppose equiv is preserved by e1 in the kth argument of fn.  Suppose equiv is
; also preserved by e2 in the kth argument of fn.  Then equiv is preserved by
; {e1 e2} in the kth argument of fn.

; Proof.  Let s be {e1 e2}.  Without loss of generality we restrict our
; attention to a function, fn, of one argument.  We have

; (implies (e1 x y) (equiv (fn x) (fn y)))
; and
; (implies (e2 x y) (equiv (fn x) (fn y)))

; We wish to prove
; (implies (s x y) (equiv (fn x) (fn y)))

; The hypothesis (s x y) establishes that there is a chain linking x to y via
; e1 and/or e2.  Let that chain be x, x2, ..., xk, y.  Since each adjacent pair
; is linked via e1 or e2, and both preserve equiv, we get that (equiv (fn x)
; (fn x2)), (equiv (fn x2) (fn x3)), ... (equiv (fn xk) (fn y)).  By the
; transitivity of equiv, therefore, (equiv (fn x) (fn y)).  Q.E.D.

; Lemma.  If e1 is preserved by e in the kth argument of fn then so is {e1 e2},
; for any relation e2.

; Proof.  We have that (e a b) implies (e1 (f ...a...) (f ...b...)).  Let s be
; {e1 e2}.  We wish to prove that (e a b) implies (s (f ...a...) (f ...b...)).
; But by Congruence Theorem 3 above, e1 is a refinement of s.  Hence, (e1 (f
; ...a...) (f ...b...))  implies (s (f ...a...) (f ...b...)).  Q.E.D.

; Congruence Theorem 5.  Let e1, ..., e4 be equivalence relations.  Then if e2
; is preserved by e1 in the kth argument of fn and e4 is preserved by e3 in the
; kth argument of fn, then {e2 e4} is preserved by {e1 e3} in the kth argument
; of fn.

; Proof.  By the above lemma, we know {e2 e4} is preserved by e1 in the kth
; argument of fn.  Similarly, {e2 e4} is preserved by e3 in the kth argument of
; fn.  Thus, the hypotheses of Theorem 4 are satisfied and we have that {e2 e4}
; is preserved by {e1 e3} in the kth argument of fn.  Q.E.D.

; We generalize the notion of the relation generated by two relations to that
; generated by n relations, {e1, e2, ..., en}.  By the above results, {e1, ...,
; en} is an equivalence relation if each ei is, each ei is a refinement of it,
; and it supports any congruence that all ei support.  We adopt the convention
; that the relation generated by {} is EQUAL and the relation denoted by {e1}
; is e1.

; In our code, generated equivalence relations are represented by lists of
; congruence-rules.  Thus, if cr1 and cr2 are two instances of the
; congruence-rule record having :equivs e1 and e2 respectively, then {e1 e2}
; can be represented by '(cr1 cr2).

; The equivalence relation to be maintained by rewrite is always represented as
; a generated equivalence relation.  In our code we follow the convention of
; always using a variant of the name ``geneqv'' for such an equivalence
; relation.  When a variable contains (or is expected to contain) the name of
; an equivalence relation rather than a :CONGRUENCE rule or geneqv, we use a
; variant of the name ``equiv'' or even ``fn''.

; The geneqv denoting EQUAL is nil.  The geneqv denoting IFF is:

(defconst *geneqv-iff*
  (list (make congruence-rule
              :rune *fake-rune-for-anonymous-enabled-rule*
              :nume nil
              :equiv 'iff)))

; This completes our general essay on the subject.  The theorems proved above
; are mentioned by name elsewhere in our code.  In addition, various details
; are discussed elsewhere.  For a simple example of how all of this works
; together, see the function subst-equiv-expr which implements substitution of
; new for old in term to produce term', where it is given that new is equiv1
; old and term is to be equiv2 term'.

; We now turn to the most primitive functions for manipulating equivalences and
; generated equivalences.  We deal with refinements first and then with the
; question of congruences.

(defun refinementp (equiv1 equiv2 wrld)

; Note: Keep this function in sync with refinementp1.

; (ACL2 is an applicative subset of Common Lisp.  When this
; function, refinementp, is called, its third argument, wrld, will be
; the current "property list world" which is just an association
; list binding symbols and property names to values.  The lookup of
; a symbol's property in wrld is via the ACL2 function getprop.
; Getprop is coded in a clever way so that in the case that the
; world is in fact that implicit in the global property list
; structure of Common Lisp, then getprop is just Common Lisp's
; non-applicative get.  In our code, wrld is always that world,
; but the code works correctly -- if somewhat more slowly -- if
; called on a different world.)

; Both equiv1 and equiv2 are function symbols.  We determine whether
; equiv1 is a known refinement of equiv2, given wrld.  If we return t
; we must be correct.  Nil means ``maybe not.''  For an explanation of
; why our database contains the 'coarsenings property instead of the
; inverse 'refinements property, see the discussion of
; geneqv-refinements below.

  (cond ((eq equiv1 'equal)

; Equal is a refinement of all equivalence relations.

         t)
        ((eq equiv2 'equal)

; No other relation is a refinement of equal.

         nil)
        ((eq equiv1 equiv2)

; Every equivalence relation is a refinement of itself.

         t)
        (t

; Otherwise, look for equiv2 among the known coarsenings of equiv1.
; The database must be kept so that the transitive property of
; refinement is manifested explicitly.  This function is called very
; often and we do not want to go searching through the transitive
; closure of refinementhood or coarseninghood.  So if e1 is a known
; refinement of e2 and e2 is a known refinement of e3, then the
; 'coarsenings property of e1 must include not just e2 but also e3.
; We know the first element in the 'coarsenings of equiv1 is equiv1
; -- which isn't equiv2 -- so we skip it.

         (member-eq equiv2
                    (cdr (getpropc equiv1 'coarsenings nil wrld))))))

; The above function determines if one equivalence symbol is a
; refinement of another.  More often we want to know whether a symbol
; is a refinement of a generated equivalence relation.  That is, is e1
; a refinement of {e2 e3}?  The most common occurrence of this
; question is when we are maintaining {e2 e3} and want to know if we
; can apply a :REWRITE rule about e1.

(defun geneqv-refinementp1 (coarsenings geneqv)

; We determine whether any name in coarsenings is the :equiv of any
; :CONGRUENCE rule in geneqv.  If so, we return the :rune of the rule
; found.

  (cond ((null geneqv) nil)
        ((member-eq (access congruence-rule (car geneqv) :equiv)
                    coarsenings)
         (access congruence-rule (car geneqv) :rune))
        (t (geneqv-refinementp1 coarsenings (cdr geneqv)))))

(defun geneqv-refinementp (equiv geneqv wrld)

; We determine whether the equivalence relation symbol equiv is a
; known refinement of the generated relation geneqv.  If so, we return
; the rune of the :CONGRUENCE rule in geneqv used, or
; *fake-rune-for-anonymous-enabled-rule* if equality was used.
; Otherwise we return nil.

; This function is used both as a function and a predicate.  Its
; primary use is as a predicate, typically to determine whether it is
; permitted to use a :REWRITE rule whose top-level equivalence is
; equiv.  If the function reports success and the rewrite in fact
; succeeds, the caller will typically use the value of the function as
; the rune of the :CONGRUENCE rule used, adding it into the tag-tree of
; the term being rewritten.

; Note: If the database contained only a 'refinements property for e2
; and e3, we would have to access both of them to determine whether e1
; was among the known refinements.  But if the database contains a
; 'coarsenings property for e1 we can access just that and then look
; for e2 or e3 in it.  This saves us doing unnecessary getprops.

; Historical Note: Once we passed around geneqvs that contained
; possibly disabled :CONGRUENCE rules and this function got, as an
; additional argument, the current enabled structure and had the job
; of ignoring those :CONGRUENCE rules.  This proved cumbersome and we
; adopted the idea of passing around geneqvs that are fully enabled.
; It means, of course, filtering out the disabled components when we
; form new geneqvs from those in the database.  In any case, this
; function does not get the enabled structure and takes no note of the
; status of any rule.

  (cond ((eq equiv 'equal) *fake-rune-for-anonymous-enabled-rule*)

; maintaining the generated equivalence relation geneqv.  Fn may be a lambda
; expression.  We return the list of generated equivalence relations to be
; maintained at each argument position.  See the essay above for some
; experiments on the optimization of this function.

; For example, while rewriting a MEMBER expression, (MEMBER x s) to
; maintain IFF we should rewrite x maintaining EQUAL and rewrite s
; maintaining SET-EQUAL.  That is, given MEMBER and IFF (for fn and
; geneqv) we wish to return (EQUAL SET-EQUAL), a list in 1:1
; correspondence with the formals of fn giving the equivalence
; relations that must be maintained for the arguments in order to
; maintain geneqv.  However, rather than (EQUAL SET-EQUAL) we return a
; list of two geneqvs, namely '(nil (cr)), where cr is the congruence
; rule which establishes that IFF is maintained by SET-EQUAL in the
; 2nd arg of MEMBER.

; The fact that nil denotes the equivalence generated by 'EQUAL,
; combined with the facts that the car and cdr of nil are nil, allows
; us to return nil to denote a list of a suitable number of generated
; equalities.  Thus, the answer nil is always correct and is in fact
; the answer returned for all those functions for which we know no
; :CONGRUENCE rules.

; If fn is a lambda-expression, we return nil.  Otherwise, the
; 'congruences property of the symbol fn is an alist.  The entries of
; the alist are of the form (equiv geneqv1 ... geneqvn).  Consider the
; entry for each refinement of some :equiv in the goal geneqv, after
; filtering out the disabled rules from each:

; (equiv1 geneqv1,1 ... geneqv1,n)
; (equiv2 geneqv2,1 ... geneqv2,n)
; ...
; (equivk geneqvk,1 ... geneqvk,n)

; The union down the first column is geneqv.  Let the union down
; subsequent columns be geneqv1, ... geneqvn.  Then by Congruence
; Theorem 5, we have that geneqv is maintained by geneqvi in the ith
; argument of fn.  Thus, we return (geneqv1 ... geneqvn).

; Observe that if some equivj in geneqv is not mentioned in the
; known congruences then we have, implicitly, the entry

; (equivj {} ... {}) and so its contribution to the union is
; justifiably ignored.

; Observe that if we throw away a disabled rule from a geneqvi,j we
; are just strengthening the equivalence relation to be maintained
; in that slot.  Thus, our heuristic use of ens is sound.

; Congruence-Based Substitution:

; Below we develop the function that substitutes new for old into
; term, where new is equiv to old and we are supposed to produce an
; answer that is geneqv to term.  The main reason we're developing
; this function is to solidify our ideas on congruence rewriting.

; Note: The relation between new and old is some primitive
; equivalence, i.e., equiv is a function symbol.  But the relation we
; are trying to maintain is a generated equivalence, i.e., a set of
; primitive equivs.  We could pursue the idea of generalizing equiv to
; a generated equivalence.  However, we don't, at the moment, see the
; value in that.  In the first place, this function is meant as a
; model of how rewrite should handle geneqvs and each :REWRITE rule is
; about a single primitive equivalence, not a generated equivalence.
; In the second place, everywhere this function is used, e.g., when we
; eliminate a (set-equal a b) hyp in the conjecture by substituting a
; for b, we have a primitive equiv relating the two.  Now we will need
; the generalized version of this function if we ever obtain b, say,
; by rewriting a under some generated equivalence.  The resulting a
; and b are not related by a primitive equiv.  But we will wait until
; we need that to implement it.

; Here is an example of the kind of substitution we implement.  Let
; list-equal be the equivalence relation that is element by element
; equality on lists (ignoring the final cdr).  Let set-equal be
; permutationp.  Suppose that if a is set-equal to b then (listify a)
; is list-equal to (listify b).  A model of listify is that it removes
; duplicates and sorts with some total ordering, but preserves the
; final cdr just to prevent (listify a) from being equal to (listify
; b).  Suppose further that if x is list-equal to y then (member e x)
; iff (member e y).

; Given the foregoing, we have three equivalence relations,
; list-equal, set-equal, and iff, and two congruences.

; Under the 'congruences property of listify we have the congruence
; (list-equal ((nume set-equal . rune))) which means that list-equal
; is preserved by set-equal in the first argument of listify.

; Under the 'congruences property of member we have (iff nil ((nume
; list-equal . rune))) which means that iff is preserved by list-equal
; in the second argument of member.  The nil implicitly says ``iff is
; preserved by equal in the first argument of member.''

; Now suppose we want to substitute a for b (which are known to be
; set-equal) into (member e (listify b)) maintaining iff.  Then we see
; that iff can be maintained on the member expression if we substitute
; a for b in (listify b) maintaining list-equal.  Then we see that
; list-equal can be maintained on the listify expression if we
; substitute a for b in b maintaining set-equal.  But a is set-equal
; to b.  So we get (member e (listify a)).

; Now let us refine this slightly.  What does it mean for one
; equivalence relation, e1, to be a refinement of another, e2?  It
; means that (implies (e1 a b) (e2 a b)).  That is, if a and b are
; in a refinement of e2 they are in e2.  So for example, EQUAL is a
; refinement of every equivalence relation because (implies (equal a
; b) (e2 a b)) is the same as (e2 a a), which is just reflexivity.

; So suppose a is equiv1 to b and we want to substitute a for b in b
; maintaining equiv2.  What is a sufficient condition on equiv1 and
; equiv2?  Equiv1 must be a refinement of equiv2.  That is, they must
; be ``even more alike'' than equiv2 requires, in the sense of being
; in a smaller equivalence class.

; In our actual implementation equiv2 is generalized to a generated
; equivalence relation.

; Essay on Patterned Congruences and Equivalences

; This Essay documents the addition of support for pattern-based congruence
; rules: congruence rules that are not based on the application of some
; function to distinct variables.  We assume familiarity both with the Essay on
; Equivalence, Refinements, and Congruence-based Rewriting and with the
; documentation topics for congruence and patterned-congruence.

; We begin with some initial observations that have guided our implementation.

; A key design principle is that the geneqv arguments to existing functions are
; essentially unchanged.  In particular, as rewrite recurs through
; rewrite-args, which recurs back through rewrite, geneqv is passed around much
; as it was before, but can be enhanced by using so-called patterned
; equivalences that are passed through these functions' arguments.  This
; approach has allowed us to continue to use some existing functions, in
; particular geneqv-lst.

; Another basic principle is that we deal with the inherently sequentiality of
; rewrite-args, in the sense that unlike ordinary geneqvs, the use of patterned
; equivalences must be done one argument at a time.  Consider the following
; example.

; (defun triv-equiv (x y)
;      (declare (ignore x y))
;      t)

; (defequiv triv-equiv)

; (defun some-consp (x y)
;   (or (consp x) (consp y)))

; (defthm triv-equiv-implies-equal-some-consp-1
;   (implies (triv-equiv x x-equiv)
;            (equal (some-consp x (cons a b))
;                   (some-consp x-equiv (cons a b))))
;   :rule-classes (:congruence))

; (defthm triv-equiv-implies-equal-some-consp-2
;   (implies (triv-equiv y y-equiv)
;            (equal (some-consp (cons a b) y)
;                   (some-consp (cons a b) y-equiv)))
;   :rule-classes (:congruence))

; (defthm cons-is-nil
;   (triv-equiv (cons x y) nil))

; Now consider the following purported "theorem".

; (thm (equal (some-consp (cons c1 c2) (cons d1 d2))
;             (some-consp nil nil)))

; Each of the two above congruence rules applies to one of the arguments of the
; first call of some-consp in the formula just above.  One might thus expect to
; be able to apply the rule cons-is-nil to each of these arguments, reducing
; the first call above of some-consp to the second call, thus proving the
; formula.  But the formula is clearly not provable; in fact, the first call of
; some-consp is true but the second is false, by definition of some-consp!  We
; therefore must take care not to propagate such congruences independently in
; the arguments of a function call, unlike for example what we do with the
; function geneqv-lst.

; Consider the following new-style congruence rule.

; (implies (inner-equiv y1 y2)
;          (outer-equiv (mv-nth 1 (foo x (g y1) z))
;                       (mv-nth 1 (foo x (g y2) z))))

; We imagine that there may be many such rules about mv-nth, so we index such
; rules not by the outer function symbol (here, mv-nth), but by the next
; function symbol down towards the designated variable (here, foo).  The
; rewriter will consider this rule after it has already dived into a call of
; foo; so the rewriter passes information about the parent call of mv-nth.  Now
; suppose we are rewriting the term (mv-nth 1 (foo a (h b1) c)), and assume
; that some rewrite rule equates (h b1) with (g b1).  As we rewrite inside-out,
; we pick up the congruence rule when we reach the call (foo a (h b1) c).  We
; might be tempted to have the rewriter ignore this congruence rule when
; passing to the term (h b1), but that would be a mistake: at that point, (h
; b1) rewrites to (g b1), and the rewriter is then called recursively.  We want
; this recursive call to notice the congruence rule, so that it will be
; sufficient to preserve inner-equiv when making that recursive call on (g b1).
; Thus, we introduce a notion of a "next" operation that is invoked when
; passing from the call of foo to the call of h, and we do not discard "next"
; data based on a mere failure to match the current call, which here is (h b1).

; This concludes initial observations that have guided our implementation.

; We assume familiarity with the concepts described in the Essay on
; Equivalence, Refinements, and Congruence-based Rewriting, but we begin with a
; brief review.  That Essay describes the notion of rewriting with respect to a
; generated equivalence relation, or geneqv: a list of congruence-rule
; structures that denotes the transitive closure of the union of the
; equivalence relations represented by the :equiv fields of those congruence
; rules.  When ACL2 rewrites a function call with respect to a geneqv, it
; rewrites each argument of that function call with respect to a geneqv derived
; by applying congruence rules to the original geneqv.  A congruence rule has
; the following form, where fn is a function symbol and its two calls are made
; on the same sequence of distinct variables, except that x and y occur
; uniquely in corresponding positions as shown.

; (implies (equiv1 x y)
;          (equiv2 (fn a1 ... x ... an)
;                  (fn a1 ... y ... an))),

; Let us call these rules "classic" congruence rules.  We will refer to equiv1
; as the "inner equivalence", equiv2 as the "outer equivalence", fn as the
; "function symbol", x as the "variable", y as the "replacement variable", and
; the first and second arguments of the above call of equiv2 as the "lhs" and
; "rhs" of the rule, respectively.  In such a case, where x is the kth argument
; of fn in the lhs of the rule, we say that it "suffices to maintain equiv1 at
; the kth argument of a call of fn in order to maintain equiv2".  This notion
; does not depend on a specific congruence rule; that is, it makes sense for
; any pair equiv1 and equiv2 of equivalence relations, any function symbol fn,
; and any positive k not exceeding the arity of fn.

; In this Essay we discuss a generalization of the above notion of congruence
; rules in which the notions of variable, replacement variable, lhs, and rhs
; still apply: congruence rules still have the following form, where lhs and
; rhs are calls of the same function symbol.

; (implies (equiv1 x y)
;          (equiv2 lhs rhs)),

; As before, lhs and rhs must be the same with the exception that the variable
; and replacement variable occur uniquely in the rule and, moreover, at the
; same address (same position) in lhs and rhs, respectively.  But we relax the
; other requirements on the arguments of lhs (and hence rhs): they need not be
; variables, and duplicates are permissible.  The following are examples of
; congruence rules that are not classic, since each lhs has non-variable
; arguments.  (As of this writing, these and other examples may be found in
; community book demos/patterned-congruences.lisp.)  In each case the variable
; is y1 and the replacement variable is y2.

; Inner equivalence e1, outer equivalence iff:

;    (implies (e1 y1 y2)
;             (iff (f1 3 y1 (cons x x))
;                  (f1 3 y2 (cons x x))))

; Inner equivalence e4, outer equivalence equal:

;    (implies (e4 y1 y2)
;             (equal (mv-nth 1 (id (f7 y1)))
;                    (mv-nth 1 (id (f7 y2)))))

; The first of these two rules is called "shallow" because y1 and y2 occur as
; top-level arguments of the lhs and rhs of the rule (respectively), just as
; they do in the classic congruence rule previously displayed above.  The
; second of these rules is not of that form because y1 and y2 occur inside a
; subsidiary function call; the second rule is thus not shallow, so we call it
; "deep".  Both are what we call "patterned congruence rules".  Thus, the class
; of congruence rules is partitioned into the classes of classic and patterned
; congruence rules, and the patterned congruence rules are partitioned into the
; subclasses of shallow and deep congruence rules.

; A shallow or deep patterned congruence rule generates what we call a (shallow
; or deep, respectively) "patterned equivalence relation", or pequiv.

(defrec pequiv
  (pattern     ; a pequiv-pattern record
   unify-subst ; a (unifying) substitution
   .
   congruence-rule ; a congruence-rule record
   )
  t)

; The :unify-subst field is nil for the pequiv generated by a patterned
; congruence rule, but need not be nil in general; we describe its role when we
; give the semantics of pequiv records later below.  The :congruence-rule field
; is the congruence-rule record corresponding to the patterned congruence rule
; from which this pequiv is derived.  Finally, we describe the :pattern field,
; which represents the lhs of a patterned congruence rule.  This field is
; actually a pequiv-pattern record (defined below), which represents a term,
; specifically a function call, along with a variable that occurs uniquely
; within the term.  Function make-pequiv-pattern creates a pattern from the
; term and (the address of the) variable, informally as follows.  The :fn of
; the pattern is the function symbol of the term.  The :posn is the one-based
; position within the arguments of the term under which the variable (uniquely)
; occurs.  The :pre-rev field is the reverse of the list of arguments strictly
; before that position, while the :post field is the list of arguments strictly
; after that position.  Finally, the :next field is either a variable
; (corresponding to the variable of the patterned congruence rule) or else is,
; recursively, the pattern representing the argument at :posn (along with the
; same variable).

(defrec pequiv-pattern ; see description just above
  (fn posn pre-rev post next)
  t)

; The discussion above is perhaps a bit misleading because of the following
; optimization.  Our algorithm attempts to extend a unifying substitution by
; matching the :pre-rev and :post fields with a term.  But we do not need to
; record matching of a variable that will not be encountered further.
; Therefore, before creating the pattern from the term, we replace each
; uniquely-occurring variable in the term by a the variable, *anonymous-var*.
; In order to justify this transformation, we first check that *anonymous-var*
; does not occur anywhere in the term.  (Perhaps it is sufficient that
; *anonymous-var* does not occur in the arguments of lhs other than the
; variable of the rule, but the stronger check avoids the need to think through
; whether that is truly sufficient.)  Then, we use a matching algorithm that
; always succeeds when matching *anonymous-var*, but never binds
; *anonymous-var* in the unifying substitution.  This optimization thus saves
; some consing.  In the rest of this discussion we will ignore the above
; optimization when we believe this will not lead to confusion.

; We will freely abuse terminology when we expect no confusion to result.  For
; example, we may confuse a patterned congruence rule with its corresponding
; pequiv, and we may confuse a term with its corresponding pattern.  Thus, we
; may speak of the "term" of a pequiv to denote the term corresponding to its
; :pattern field; similarly, the "variable" of a pequiv is just the variable of
; the corresponding patterned congruence rule.  (One could expect to reach that
; variable by following the :next field of the :pattern of the pequiv until
; :next is a variable, except of course that the variable will have been
; replaced by the anonymous variable described above.)

; A pequiv record denotes the following equivalence relation, which we may
; refer to as the corresponding "patterned equivalence".  For this discussion
; we assume a global binding of variables to values; intuitively, when you
; submit a formula to ACL2 to prove, the variables in the formula represent
; values provided by an arbitrary such binding.  Recall the notion of an
; equivalence relation generated by a binary relation, namely, the
; equivalential (reflexive, symmetric, transitive) closure of that binary
; relation.  The patterned equivalence relation denoted by a pequiv is the
; equivalential closure of the following binary relation.  Let t0 be the term
; of the pequiv.  Two values v1 and v2 are related if for some substitution s
; that extends the :unify-subst of the pequiv and for variants s1 and s2 of s
; obtained by rebinding only the variable of the pequiv, then v1 = t0/s1 and v2
; = t0/s2.

; Let p be a pequiv, fn be a function symbol, and first-rev and rest be term
; lists.  We next define the notion of the "next equiv" for a pequiv, p, with
; respect to fn, first-rev, and rest.  Let pat be the :pattern field of p.
; This next equiv is either undefined or is obtained from p as described below.
; Let k, pre-rev, post, and next be the :pre-rev, :post, and :next fields of
; pat, respectively.  The next equiv is undefined unless, at a minimum: fn is
; equal to the :fn field of pat, first-rev has the same length as the :pre-rev
; field of pat, and rest has the same length as the :post field of pat.  So
; assume that these conditions hold.  Let s0 be the :unify-subst field of p,
; and let s be the minimal extension of s0 such that pre-rev/s = first-rev and
; post/s = rest, if such s exists; otherwise the next equiv does not exist.  If
; p is a deep pequiv, then the next equiv is the result of replacing the
; :unify-subst of p by s and replacing the :pattern of p by next.  If p is a
; shallow equiv, then the next equiv for p is the equivalence relation of the
; :congruence-rule of p.  Note: If we refer to the next equiv for p and u,
; where u is a term, we are really referring to the next equiv for p with
; respect to fn, first-rev and rest, where u is of the form (cons fn (revappend
; first-rev (cons arg rest))) for some arg and the length of first-rev is the
; value of the :posn field of the :pattern field of p.

; The correctness of our implementation relies on the theorems below, whose
; proofs we leave to the reader.  The first theorem justifies the addition of a
; pequiv to the list of equivalence relations being maintained by the rewriter,
; while the second justifies how a pequiv is used when rewriting an argument of
; a function call.

; Patterned Congruence Theorem 1.  Let E be the pequiv corresponding to a
; provable patterned congruence rule with outer equivalence e2.  Then for terms
; t1 and t2, (implies (E t1 t2) (e2 t1 t2)) is provable.

; Patterned Congruence Theorem 2.  Let p be a pequiv, let u be a term, and
; assume that the next equiv for p and u exists; call it n.  Let arg be the kth
; argument of u, where k is the :posn field of the :pattern field of u, let
; arg' be a term, and let u' be the result of replacing the kth argument of u
; by arg'.  Then (implies (n arg arg') (p u u')).

; A final data structure for supporting patterned congruence rules is the
; pequiv-info record.  The rewrite clique takes a pequiv-info formal parameter
; that is either nil or such a record.

(defrec pequiv-info

; Each function in the rewrite clique has a pequiv-info argument that either is
; nil or is one of these records.  In the latter case, that argument represents
; information from a parent call of rewrite on a function call, where one
; argument of the call is the "current term" being processed, and other
; "sibling arguments" of the call are stored as indicated below.

  (((rewritten-args-rev ; reverse of (rewritten) preceding sibling arguments
     .
     rest-args) ; later sibling arguments, not yet rewritten
    .
    (alist ; alist under which the current term and rest-args are rewritten
     .
     bkptr)) ; one-based position of the current term
   .
   (geneqv ; geneqv of the parent call of rewrite
    fn ; function symbol of the term rewritten by the parent call of rewrite
    .

; Finally, deep-pequiv-lst is a list of (deep) pequivs from the parent call of
; rewrite, each of which has an enabled :congruence-rule field.

    deep-pequiv-lst))
  t)

; When rewrite is called with a pequiv-info argument of nil, its spec is
; unchanged from what it was before the introduction of patterned congruences:
; the term returned by (rewrite term alist ... geneqv ...) is provably in
; relation geneqv to term/alist.  Of course, "provably" should be understood
; relative to the assumptions implicit in the other arguments of rewrite: the
; type-alist, world, and pot-list.

; Subtle Logical Aside.  More subtly, terms u1 and u2 can be understood as
; being "provably in relation geneqv" if there is a sequence of terms t0, ...,
; tk such that t0 = u1, tk = u2, and for each i < k and where j = i+1, there is
; some equivalence relation E in geneqv such that (E ti tj) is provable (again,
; with respect to the implicit assumptions).  We may wish to take this view of
; "provably in relation geneqv" because the geneqv relation is defined in terms
; of a transitive closure, which is not a first-order notion.  In the case of
; ACL2 we could actually provide a first-order definition of geneqv by using
; sequences: it is first-order to state that there is a finite sequence of
; values such that each is in relation E to the next for some E in geneqv.
; Either of these two notions of "provably in relation geneqv" is in fact
; adequate; choose your favorite!  End of Subtle Logical Aside.

; We turn now to modifying the above spec for the case of (rewrite term alist
; bkptr ... geneqv pequiv-info ...), where pequiv-info is a pequiv-info record
; with fields rewritten-args-rev, rest-args, alist, bkptr, parent-geneqv,
; parent-fn, and deep-pequiv-lst, and obvious assumptions are left implicit (in
; particular, bkptr is the length of rewritten-args-rev).  Generate an
; equivalence relation E by extending geneqv by each of the following, as p
; ranges over members of deep-pequiv-lst: the next-equiv for p with respect to
; parent-fn, rewritten-args-rev, and rest-args/alist.  Then the output from the
; above call of rewrite is provably in relation E to term.  (Note: in our
; implementation, p also ranges over some pequivs that provably refine a member
; of parent-geneqv; but we can include these, by the theorems above.)  We
; discuss later how to prove this spec, after summarizing how pequivs are
; processed by the rewriter.

; In order to minimize property list accesses, we store deep and shallow
; equivalences in a single structure, as follows.

(defrec pequivs-property
  (deep shallow . deep-pequiv-p)
  t)

; The :deep and :shallow fields are alists whose elements have the form (equiv
; pequiv1 pequiv2 ... pequivn), where each pequivk is a patterned equivalence
; that refines equiv.  When such a record is the value of the 'pequivs property
; of a function symbol, fn, then fn is the :fn field of the :pattern field of
; each such pequivk in the case of the :shallow field; but in the case of the
; :deep field, each such pequivk is a deep pequiv, and fn is the :fn field of
; the :next field of the :pattern field.  In brief, consider a patterned
; congruence rule with function symbol fn together with outer equivalence e and
; corresponding pequiv, p.  If the rule (and hence also p) is shallow, then we
; will find p in the :shallow field of the 'pequivs property of fn, which is an
; alist with an element (e ... p ...).  Otherwise the rule (and hence also p)
; is deep, with lhs of the form (fn ... (fn2 ...) ...) such that the variable
; of the rule occurs in the displayed call of fn2.  In that case, we will find
; p in the :deep field of the 'pequivs property of fn2, which is an alist with
; an element (e ... p ...).

; Algorithm discussion.  Next, we describe how rewrite passes pequiv
; information to rewrite-args and how rewrite-args passes pequiv information to
; rewrite.

; Rewrite computes a list of deep-pequivs and a list of shallow-pequivs to pass
; to rewrite-args using function pequivs-for-rewrite-args, where the input term
; is a call of function symbol fn, a symbol (not a lambda).  In (a) and (b)
; below, we compute the next pequiv with respect to the following function
; symbol, first-rev, and rest: the function symbol is fn; first-rev is the
; :rewritten-args-rev field of pequiv-info; and for rest, we take the
; :rest-args field of pequiv-info and instantiate it with the :alist field of
; pequiv-info.  Note that the pequiv-info argument is guaranteed not to be nil
; if there are any pequivs in (a) or (b) for which to take the next equiv.

; (a) Derive the list of next equivs from the :deep-pequiv-lst field of the
;     pequiv-info argument, restricting to those (deep) pequivs whose :next
;     field has :fn field equal to fn.  Sort these into a list of deep pequivs
;     and a list of shallow pequivs.

; (b) Derive the list of next equivs from deep pequivs stored in the 'pequivs
;     property of fn, restricting to those that are stored under an outer equiv
;     that is enabled and refines the geneqv of pequiv-info.  Sort these into a
;     list of deep pequivs and a list of shallow pequivs.

; (c) Compute additional shallow pequivs from the shallow pequivs stored in the
;     'pequivs property of fn, restricting to those that are stored under an
;     outer equiv that is enabled and refines the geneqv argument of (the
;     present call of) rewrite.

; Note that rewrite is not passed any shallow pequivs.  Rather, rewrite derives
; shallow-pequivs as described above and passes these to rewrite-args, which
; uses them to augment the geneqv passed to the child call of rewrite.  That
; augmentation is done by geneqv-and-pequiv-info-for-rewrite, which is called
; by rewrite-args in preparation for its call of rewrite; we describe this
; next.

; Now consider a call (rewrite-args args alist bkptr rewritten-args-rev
; deep-pequiv-lst shallow-pequiv-lst parent-geneqv parent-fn ... geneqv-lst
; ...).  These arguments are used by function
; geneqv-and-pequiv-info-for-rewrite to produce the geneqv and pequiv-info
; arguments for its "child call" of rewrite.  That child call's geneqv is
; constructed initially from the geneqv-lst passed to rewrite-args, but is
; extended (by function geneqv-for-rewrite) using the next equiv for each
; member of shallow-pequiv-lst with respect to parent-fn, rewritten-args-rev,
; and (cdr args).  In doing this, we maintain the invariant that a geneqv does
; not contain two equivs such that one refines the other.  The pequiv-info
; record for the child call of rewrite is constructed by function
; pequiv-info-for-rewrite, with fields taken unchanged from the inputs of
; rewrite-args, in particular without taking the "next" for the pequivs.
; Except, nil may be returned for pequiv-info when a pequiv-info record is not
; needed by rewrite, in order to save consing; see pequiv-info-for-rewrite.

; We will briefly sketch the proof by computational induction that the ACL2
; rewriter satisfies the spec given above for rewrite.  The interesting
; induction steps are for calling rewrite on a first argument that is a
; function call when the pequiv-info argument is not nil, and for calling
; rewrite-args on a non-empty first parameter, args.  Our spec for rewrite is
; above, and although a detailed proof would also involve a spec for each
; function in the rewrite clique, for this sketch we give an additional spec
; only for rewrite-args.  (Then we will sketch the proof.)

; Consider a call (rewrite-args args alist bkptr rewritten-args-rev
; deep-pequiv-lst shallow-pequiv-lst parent-geneqv parent-fn ... geneqv-lst
; ...), which results in a term list args', and define the "input term" and
; "output term" to be, respectively, (cons parent-fn (revappend
; rewritten-args-rev args/alist)) and (cons parent-fn args').  Assume that
; geneqv-lst is a list of generated equivalence relations that corresponds
; positionally to args, such that for each element g of this list and
; corresponding position k in the argument list of parent-fn, it suffices to
; preserve g at the kth argument of parent-fn in order to preserve
; parent-geneqv.  Then the input and output terms are provably equivalent with
; respect to the equivalence relation generated by parent-geneqv,
; deep-pequiv-lst, and shallow-pequiv-lst.

; Turning now to the proof sketch, first consider the induction step for
; (rewrite-args (cons arg rest-args) alist bkptr rewritten-args-rev
; deep-pequiv-lst shallow-pequiv-lst parent-geneqv parent-fn ... (cons geneqv
; geneqv-lst) ...).  This call is equal to the call (rewrite-args rest-args
; alist (1+ bkptr) (cons rewritten-arg rewritten-args-rev) deep-pequiv-lst
; shallow-pequiv-lst parent-geneqv parent-fn ... geneqv-lst), where
; rewritten-arg is produced by rewrite using the geneqv and pequiv-info
; returned by the call that rewrite-args makes of
; geneqv-and-pequiv-info-for-rewrite.  It suffices by the inductive hypothesis
; to show that arg/alist and rewritten-arg are provably in the equivalence
; relation generated by parent-geneqv, deep-pequiv-lst, and shallow-pequiv-lst.
; But this follows from Patterned Congruence Theorem 2, since by hypothesis
; geneqv is sufficient for preserving parent-geneqv, and because the spec for
; rewrite is with respect to the next equivs for deep-pequiv-lst and
; shallow-pequiv-lst.

; Now consider the induction step for (rewrite term alist ... pequiv-info ...).
; Now pequivs-for-rewrite-args sets up a call of rewrite-args with next equivs
; generated from pequiv-info (if non-nil) as in (a) and (b) above, and with new
; pequivs as in (c) above.  These next equivs are justified by Patterned
; Congruence Theorems 1 and 2.  By the inductive hypothesis, that call of
; rewrite-args returns a term that is suitably equivalent to term/alist.  Then
; the inductive hypothesis takes care of any ensuing call of rewrite, say from
; rewrite-if or from the right-hand side of an applied rewrite rule.

; We conclude this essay by emphasizing that our support for patterned
; congruence rules is limited; in particular, it is mainly for the rewriter.
; Thus, pequivs fail to be used heuristically in some places that ordinary
; congruences are used: for example, as in test-3 in community book
; books/demos/patterned-congruences.lisp, remove-trivial-equivalences and
; fertilize-clause doesn't use patterned congruence rules.  If we decide to add
; such support, then we should think carefully so that we don't introduce
; unsoundness.  See the examples in the above book involving congruence rules
; triv-equiv-implies-equal-some-consp-1 and

; (test . n)         pop and test the top of the stack and if nil,
;                    transfer control to the instruction labeled n,
;                    else execute the next instruction.

; (ret . lst)        Lst is a list that is irrelevant except for
;                    its length, n.  Pop one value off the stack and
;                    hold it as the returned value of the lambda
;                    expression just evaluated, then pop n things
;                    off the stack, clearing the most recent frame,

; The following code is a little weird.  We implement a data structure called
; "assumptions" for representing assumed terms.  In particular, we can add to
; the data structure to assume a term true and then we can quickly convert that
; structure to one in which the term is assumed false.  The pair of these
; assumptions always costs exactly two conses, total: either the first costs 1
; cons and the next does also, or the first costs 2 and the next is free.  Our
; representation of assumptions relies upon the fact that the keywords :NOT and
; :IGNORE-WHEN-CONVERTING-TO-CLAUSE are not legal variable symbols.  Our
; machinery for manipulating assumptions also exploits the fact that we never
; assume a quoted term -- we simply decide the issue.  Thus, (nvariablep x)
; means (ffn-symb x) is a function symbol or lambda expression.

; To assume an atm true, we add it to the list (one cons).  To assume an atom
; false, we add it to the list and then add :NOT in front of it (two conses).
; To negate the last assumption you either add a :NOT (one cons) or delete a
; :NOT (no conses).  The element :IGNORE-WHEN-CONVERTING-TO-CLAUSE plays no
; special role in determining the value of an atom -- it looks like a variable
; symbol assumed true.  We never "negate" it though!  That is, the process of
; "negating the last assumption" must be done in a disciplined way in which you
; negate an assumption that you were responsible for adding in the first place.

; Below we first write the function for recovering from this structure the
; assumed value of a term, getting the answer t (for assumed true), 'f (for
; assumed false) or nil (for unassumed).  Like member-term and
; member-complement-term this recovering process knows about the commutativity
; of equal and iff.  But this is faster than those two, both because
; assumptions cost fewer conses and because we get the answer to the question
; "is it assumed and if so which way?" in the same time we can use member-term
; or member-complement-term to get only half the answer.

; Then we write the function for converting an assumptions structure into a
; clause.  All assumptions after the :IGNORE-WHEN-CONVERTING-TO-CLAUSE marker
; are ignored during the process.  Thus, it is possible to load into an initial
; assumption a bunch of literals that will be known true or false appropriately
; during the clausification process but which will not be transferred into the
; answer clauses produced.

; Finally we write the function that converts a clause into an initial set of
; assumptions, marked :IGNORE-WHEN-CONVERTING-TO-CLAUSE.

; All of this is in support of our fast clausifier.  The whole idea, here
; exposed at the very end of this long comment, is to make it fast to explore
; and recognize tautologies, paying the price for creating the clause only when
; we have to.

; Aka The Satriani Hack (Note on the Derivation of the Name: The theme music of
; this exercise was Joe Satriani's "Motorcycle Driver" on The Extremist album.
; That track was not just what I was listening to while this code was written;
; the structure of the music sort of inspired the code.  The music starts out
; boringly repetitive and "slow."  A fairly decent guitar solo at 2:02 doesn't
; do the job, in the sense that after this attempted speedup the plodding drums
; still dominate and the repetitive theme reemerges.  But then, at 3:33 the
; guitar, spewing frustration, breaks out into a really wild solo that persists
; into the next reoccurrence of the theme and ends the song.  The sense I get
; while listening to that solo is that the guitarist simply abandoned the
; structure and did whatever it took.  That is the theme of the Satriani Hack,
; which actually is not localized here but involves little tweaks and patches
; in several places, to get the speedup I wanted.  JSM.)

; This function is akin to subsumption-replacement-loop except that it only
; takes one step and is much more limited in its detection of the
; subsumption/replacement conditions.  Let lst be a set of clauses we have to
; prove.  Imagine that we are going to add cl1 to that set.  If cl1 is subsumed
; by any clause in lst, we needn't add it.  Among other things, this function
; checks a limited form of that condition; if we return 'subsumed1 then cl1 is
; subsumed by some clause in lst.  Otherwise, suppose that cl1 can be resolved
; against some clause, cl2, of lst to produce a clause cl3 that subsumes cl2.
; We call this a "replacement resolution."  For example, suppose

; cl1 = {a b  c d   e}
; cl2 = {a b -c d f e g}
; cl3 = {a b    d f e g}

; Then when we add cl1 to the set of clauses to prove we can delete cl2 from
; the set and replace it with cl3.  In addition, if cl1 simply subsumes some
; cl2, we can delete cl2 from the set.  If this function does not return
; 'subsumed1 then it returns a new set of clauses in which some of those
; subsumed by cl1 have been deleted and some of those that participate in
; replacement resolution with cl1 have been appropriately replaced.  Thus, if
; this function does not return 'subsumed1 it is sound to add cl1 to the output
; of this function and attack that set of clauses.

; The "quick and dirty" part of this is that we do not consider all possible
; literals upon which to do replacement resolution but rather only consider
; resolving on the first literal in cl1 that differs from the corresponding
; literal of cl2, and we insist that the corresponding literal of cl2 be the
; required complement.  The "step" part comes from the fact that we don't
; consider every possible pair of cl1 and cl2 but only the about-to-be-added
; cl1 against the already added cl2s.

; This rather draconian restriction is judged heuristically important because
; of the order in which clauses are generated.  The motivating example was of
; the form

;     (clausify
;      '(not (if A
;                (if (if E1
;                        't
;                        (if E2
;                            't
;                            E3))
;                    B
;                    'nil)
;                'nil))
;      nil
;      t    ; or nil, no lambdas here.
;      (sr-limit (w state)))

; Before we added this quick and dirty test, we created
; {-a -e1         -b}
; {-a  e1 -e2     -b}
; {-a  e1  e2 -e3 -b}
; The general-purpose subsumption-replacement-loop would work this down to
; {-a -e1         -b}
; {-a     -e2     -b}
; {-a         -e3 -b}

; But that was slow because it considers all possible ways of resolving and
; subsuming.  After a couple of days of Satriani and some false starts, it was
; realized (in the shower, no less) that the clauses were probably generated in
; just the right order to let us detect this condition quickly on the fly.

; Another motivating example comes from clausifying the opened up version of
; (not (member x '(1 2 ... 128))).  This arises when the member term is used as
; a hypothesis.  The problem becomes:

; (clausify '(not (if e1 't (if e2 't (if e3 't ...(if e127 't e128)...))))
;           nil t (sr-limit (w state)))

; which is like the (if e1 ...) nest above.  In Nqthm the clausifier had
; special purpose rules for handling a negated disjunction, but that is harder
; in ACL2 because the compiled form of the term hides the negation.  But the
; Satriani hack takes care of it, by cleaning up the clause set locally as it
; is produced, leaving the quadratic general-purpose
; subsumption-replacement-loop with nothing to do.

; To see this hack in action, first define the function that maps
; the list of standard chars into the list of standard codes:

;     (defun make-standard-codes (lst)
;      (if (endp lst)
;          nil
;          (cons (char-code (car lst)) (make-standard-codes (cdr lst)))))

; and use it to define the appropriate constant

;     (defconst *standard-codes* (make-standard-codes *standard-chars*))

; Then prove

;     (thm (implies (member x *standard-chars*)
;                   (member (char-code x) *standard-codes*)))

; With the Satriani hack in place, the proof takes 3.87 seconds.  With the
; Satriani hack omitted, it takes 431.92 seconds!  (Note: to omit the Satriani
; hack from these sources redefine the function if-interp-add-clause below so
; that ans is bound to ac rather than to the call of
; quick-and-dirty-subsumption-replacement-step.)

; Note that the resolvent of arg1 and arg2 on this literal produces a

; complement of the literal in question.

; Here is a more careful argument that we can delete the complement.
; If the subsumption fails but arg1 has the form {x} u arg1' (x not
; in arg1'), arg1' subsumes arg2, and -x occurs in arg2, then the

; Thus, in (set-equal b a1) we will rewrite b maintaining set-equal
; and will choose either to replace b by a2 or a3, since list-equal
; and equal are both refinements.  The point is that ultimately in the

; Note: This function used to depend on the objective, obj, of the rewrite.

; by the goal

;   (IMPLIES (AND (NOT (ZP LEN)) (<= LEN 1))
;            (CONSP (I-FROM I 1)))

; and although the term (I-FROM I LEN) was a term to be expanded under
; induction, (I-FROM I 1) was not.  We had 27 other failures that might have
; been due to this same problem, but we didn't investigate them.  Instead, we
; are omitting a case here for *ts-one*.

; We have also had problems when including this (deleted) case, depending on

; Comment on Historical Waffling over Calling Type-Set in Rewrite-Solidify
;
; Back in v1-7 we called
; (type-set term nil force-flg type-alist nil ens wrld nil)
; here, where force-flg was passed into rewrite-solidify.
;
; We abandoned that in v1-8 and most of v1-9 and replaced it with a simple
; lookup of term in the type-alist,
;
; (assoc-type-alist term type-alist wrld)
;
; and marked the occasion by writing the following comment:
;
; ; At one time we called type-set here.  As a result, the prover could simplify
; ;
; ; (thm (implies (and (not (< y 0))
; ;                    (rationalp y)
; ;                    (not (equal 0 y)))
; ;               (equal aaa (< 0 y))))
; ;
; ; to
; ;
; ; (implies (and (not (< y 0))
; ;               (rationalp y)
; ;               (not (equal 0 y)))
; ;          (equal aaa t))
; ;
; ; However, in the interest of performance we have decided to avoid a full-blown
; ; call of type-set here.  You get what you pay for, perhaps.
;
; However, then Rich Cohen observed that if we are trying to relieve a hypothesis
; in a lemma and the hyp rewrites to an explicit cons expression we fail to
; recognize that it is non-nil!  Here is a thm that fails for that reason:
;
;  (defstub foo (x a) t)
;  (defaxiom lemma
;   (implies (member x a) (equal (foo x a) x)))
;  (thm (equal (foo x (cons x y)) x))
;
; We have decided to revert to the use of type-set in rewrite-solidify, but
; only when we have an objective of t or nil.  Under this condition we use
; force-flg nil and dwp t.  We tried the div proofs with force-flg t here
; and found premature forcing killed us.

; are :program functions we cannot do this directly without reclassifying them.
; In addition, we would first need to prove the lemma that term-order is a
; total ordering.  Rather than undertake such a large proof effort, we attack a

; xtermp, xterm-order, and xremove-invisible-fncalls to have the properties we

; analogously to the definition above of term-order+ and we prove that
; xterm-order+ is a total ordering on xterms.

; There are four subclasses of rewrite rule, distinguished by the :subclass slot.

;   indicating that in replacing lhs by rhs (the binding of) y moves forward to
;   the spot occupied by (the binding of) x, and that x and y only appear on
;   the left-hand side as arguments to functions in fns.  Thus, to prevent
;   loops we adopt the heuristic convention of replacing lhs by rhs only if
;   each y is smaller than the corresponding x, with respect to functions that
;   are considered "invisible" if they are invisible with respect to every
;   function in fns.

; 'abbreviation - the special case where there are no hyps, a nil loop-stopper,
;   and the rhs satisfies the abbreviationp predicate.  Heuristic-info is
;   irrelevant here.  Non-recursive definitions whose bodies are abbreviationps
;   are stored this way rather than as :subclass 'definition.

; 'meta - a rule justified by a metatheorem.  In this case, the lhs is the
;   metafunction symbol to be applied, and hyps is a function of one (term)
;   argument that generates a hypothesis for the metatheorem.  In this case the
;   :heuristic-info is of the form (name fn thm-name1 hyp-fn thm-name2)
;   . combined-arities-alist); see rewrite-with-lemma.

; Rockwell Addition: The recursivep property used to be the fn name if the
; fn in question was singly recursive.  Now it is a singleton list (fn).

; 'definition - a rule implementing a non-abbreviational definitional equation.
; In this case :heuristic-info is the pair (recursivep . controller-alist)
; where recursivep is nil (if this is a nonrec definition) or a truelist of
; symbols naming all the fns in the ``clique'' (singly recursive functions have
; a singleton list as their recursivep property); and controller-alist is an
; alist pairing each fn named in recursivep to a mask of t's and nil's in 1:1
; correspondence with the formals of the fn and indicating with t's which
; arguments control the recursion for this definition.

(defun fnstack-term-member (term fnstack)

; If we are not careful, the call (rewrite rewritten-body ...) in
; rewrite-fncall can cause an infinite loop.  Here we describe a mechanism for
; avoiding such loops.  This mechanism is enforced by the call to
; fnstack-term-member in rewrite-fncall, which must return nil before opening
; up a function call.

; The problem is the interaction between opening up function definitions and
; use of equalities on the type-alist.  Suppose that (foo x) is defined to be
; (bar (foo (cdr x))) in a certain case.  But imagine that on the type-alist we
; have (foo (cdr x)) = (foo x).  Then rewritten-body, here, is (bar (foo x)).
; Because it contains a rewriteable call we rewrite it again.  If we do so with
; the old fnstack, we will open (foo x) to (bar (foo x)) again and infinitely
; regress.

; The following event list illustrates the problem we wish to avoid.
; (defun bar (x) (declare (ignore x)) 7)
; (in-theory (disable bar))
; (defun foo (x)
;  (if (consp x) (bar (foo (cdr x))) t))
; :brr t
; :monitor (:definition foo) t
; (thm (implies (and (consp x) (equal (foo x) (foo uuu))) (not (equal (foo (cdr x)) (foo x)))))
; :eval
; :eval
; :eval
; ...

; Doing a :path after the :evals shows an infinite regress rewriting (foo x).
; The problem is that lit 3 is on the type-alist and causes (foo (cdr x)) to
; rewrite to (foo x).  Thus, when (foo x) in lit 2 is rewritten it first goes
; to (bar (foo (cdr x))) and thence to (bar (foo x)).

; This same loop occurs in Nqthm, though it has never been fired in anger, as
; far as we know.

; In Version 2.5 and before we handled this rare loop in a very non-rugged way,
; using fnstack unchanged in the aforementioned recursive call (rewrite
; rewritten-body ...): If the term we're expanding reoccurs in the rewritten
; body, we won't rewrite the rewritten body.  In that approach, if we're
; expanding (foo x a) and it rewrites to (bar (foo (cdr x) a)) and thence to
; (bar (foo x a)), we'll break the loop.  BUT if it goes instead to (bar (foo x
; a')), we'll just naively go around the loop.

; Starting with Version_2.6, we extended fnstack with (:term . term) in that
; recursive call to rewrite.  Through Version_2.8, before making that recursive
; call we first checked the fnstack to see if an entry (:term . x) was already
; there for some subterm x of rewritten-body.  This was the only place that we
; paid attention to elements of fnstack of the form (:term . x).

; Starting with Version_2.9, we do a simpler check for membership of (:term
; . term) in the fnstack.  (The present function implements that membership
; check without the need to cons up (:term . term).)  The unique such check is
; done where it makes the most sense: just before we open up a function call in
; rewrite-fncall.

; Essay on Too-many-ifs

; The discussion below applies to a long-standing "too-many-ifs" heuristic that
; is used only for nonrecursive function applications when no recursive
; function application is on the stack.  Up through Version_3.6.1, we always
; rewrote the body of nonrecursive function calls and then applied this
; heuristic.  After Version_3.6.1, we modified this heuristic to avoid
; rewriting the bodies of some such calls, by calling a version of the function
; first on unrewritten bodies and then, possibly again, after rewriting.  This
; gives rise to two functions, too-many-ifs-pre-rewrite and
; too-many-ifs-post-rewrite.

; Let args be the list of actuals to a nonrec fn.  We wish to determine whether
; the expansion of the fn call introduces too many IFs all at once into the
; rewritten body of fn.  Our motivation comes from an example like (M2 (ZTAK &
; & &) (ZTAK & & &) (ZTAK & & &)) where the careless opening up of everybody
; produces a formula with several hundred IFs in it because of M2's duplication
; of the IFs coming from the simplification of the ZTAKs.  An early thought was
; never to expand a nonrec fn -- at the top level of the clause -- if it had
; some IFs in its args and to wait till CLAUSIFY has cleaned things up.  That
; slowed a proveall down by a factor of 2 -- and by a factor of 13 in
; PRIME-LIST-TIMES-LIST -- because of the ridiculously slow expansion of such
; basic nonrec fns as AND, OR, NOT, and NLISTP.

; This heuristic originally took ARGS and the rewritten right-hand side of fn,
; VAL, and computed something like

; (> (ITERATE FOR ARG IN ARGS SUM (* (COUNT-IFS ARG) (OCCUR-CNT ARG VAL)))
;    (ITERATE FOR ARG IN ARGS SUM (COUNT-IFS ARG)))

; where the OCCUR-CNT counted the number of times ARG occurred in VAL.  The
; heuristic was slightly optimized by observing that if no IFs occur in any arg
; then there is no point in doing the OCCUR-CNTs and that once the left hand
; side has been pushed beyond the right there is no point in continuing.  (We
; say "something like" because the code, at least as of Version_3.6.1,
; double-counted an ARG when it was a subterm of some other arg in ARGS.)

; However, when Sol Swords profiled some book certification typically done at
; Centaur, his results suggested that nearly half of the rewriting and 15% of
; the total time (where 45% of the total time seemed to be in include-book-fn)
; was spent in too-many-ifs.  It turns out that we can save most of the
; too-many-ifs time by doing a preliminary check, before rewriting the
; right-hand-side, to see if it is "expected" (in some very inexact sense) that
; the right-hand-side would have too-many-ifs.  The function
; too-many-ifs-pre-rewrite does this check using the unrewritten body, which
; not only saves potential rewriting but also can be faster because the unrewritten
; body is often much smaller than the rewritten body.

; At one point we avoided too-many-ifs-post-rewrite entirely, which pushed our
; savings above 20%.  But we had failures in the regression suite:
; collect-times-1d in books/arithmetic-2/meta/common-meta.lisp and
; sum-pp4-reduce-to in books/rtl/rel7/support/lib1.delta1/mult-proofs.lisp.  In
; these cases, the proof failed because the new heuristic stopped fix from
; opening up, while the original heuristic allowed (fix x) to open up for the
; particular x at hand because (acl2-numberp x) simplified to t.  We solved
; that problem: at first we made an exception for fix, but now we simply
; ignored occurrences in test positions of calls of IF when counting argument
; occurrences in right-hand-sides of definition rules (see var-counts).

; Lemma make-shared-variables-dag-as-term-l-lemma in community book
; books/defexec/dag-unification/terms-as-dag.lisp is a good test case: it
; proves using the old heuristic but seems difficult to prove using the new
; heuristic (too-many-ifs-pre-rewrite) alone.  It is also notable in that if
; memory serves, the new heuristic specifically fails on lambdas.  We are
; pretty happy with our current implementation, which is a compromise: Use
; too-many-ifs-pre-rewrite to avoid opening up the right-hand side of a
; definition at all in some cases, but even if we do open it up, use
; too-many-ifs-post-rewrite to apply the old too-many-ifs heuristic.

; branches; see var-counts1.  These decisions are merely heuristic, and might
; benefit from further experimentation, though we are pretty happy with current
; performance based on tests to date.  But our decisions deserve some remarks:

; Note that the var-counts are used before attempting to rewrite the rhs.  If
; we wished, var-counts could return a trivial result consisting of a list of
; zeroes from var-counts; as a result we will always rewrite the rhs.  But we
; want to short-circuit that rewrite when it seems reasonable to do so, such as
; when we have pretty good reason to believe that the too-many-ifs heuristic
; used _after_ rewriting would reject opening up the definition anyhow.

; For us to have good reason, we should be careful not to have the returned
; var-counts be too large, which could make it too easy to reject the
; opening-up.  For this reason, we ignore occurrences in test positions of
; calls of IF, since we can imagine those may disappear after the instantiated
; rhs is simplified.  But we don't want the var-counts to be too small, since
; then we might miss opportunities for efficiencies in early termination.  We
; might for example get all zeroes if we always take the minimum of var-counts
; in the two branches of any IF call, since it could often be the case that a
; formal parameter only occurs in one of the two branches.

; So, we take the maximum of two branches of any IF call.  In an early
; experiment we had good results taking the sum rather than the maximum: only a
; couple of proofs failed during ACL2 regression, and we got a 20% speed-up on
; a test provided by Sol Swords on certification done at Centaur.  But the sum
; is too large if we really imagine the IF tests simplifying away, so we take
; the maximum as a sort of compromise between the sum and the minimum (which
; could easily be too small, as explained above).

; It seems odd that the existing approach only counted conses, since there

; observed a failure in the event (verify-guards meta-integerp ...) in
; community book books/arithmetic-3/bind-free/integerp-meta.lisp.  We have
; extracted the following from that failure: This succeeded when using
; (cons-count (cadr term)) in the case (fquotep term) below, but not when using
; 0 in that case instead.

; apparently because (mv-nth 1 x) now opens up to (cadr x).

; So for backward compatibility we now define a bounded version of cons-count.

; Notice that our bounded size computation can cause the "wrong" term to be

; WARNING: If you change the layout of the rewrite-constant in a way that

; community books:

; books/arithmetic-5/lib/basic-ops/default-hint.lisp  -- one occurrence
; books/hints/basic-tests.lisp -- two occurrences

; WARNING: The name "rewrite-constant" is a misnomer because it is not really
; constant during rewriting.  For example, the active-theory is frequently
; toggled.

; The Rewriter's Constant Argument -- rcnst

; In nqthm the rewriter accessed many "special variables" -- variables
; bound outside the rewriter.  Some of these were true specials in the
; rewriter, in the sense that the rewriter sometimes re-bound them in its
; recursion.  An example of such a variable is fnstack, which is nil
; outside the rewriter and re-bound inside the rewriter only when we
; tentatively expand a function call.  But other nqthm special variables
; were just constants -- as far as the rewriter was concerned.  For example,
; current-lit, the literal on which rewrite-clause called rewrite, is
; set outside the call of rewrite and read but never written inside.

; We package up these "rewrite constants" as a single record so that
; we can pass all of them in one argument.

; We list below some of the "constants" in question and where they are set.  We
; then give the meaning of each field.

; Active-theory is either :standard or :arithmetic.  (It was added first to
; Version_2.7.)  It is used to determine whether we are in the middle of
; rewriting arithmetic expressions in support of non-linear arithmetic.  This
; field is toggled during rewriting.  Thus, we put it at the front of the data
; structure.

; Current-enabled-structure is an enabled-structure that contains the theory
; which specifies which rules are to be considered enabled.

; Pt -- a parent tree (see Essay on Parent Trees) denoting a set of literals in
; current-clause and containing the one we are working on in rewrite-clause and
; all the others that have rewritten to false.  Any poly in the
; simplify-clause-pot-lst that depends on one of these literals is considered
; "inactive."  To avoid tail biting we do not use inactive polys.

; Restrictions-alist is used for :restrict hints.  (Someday we should flesh out
; this explanation.)

; Expand-lst -- a list of expand-hint structures used heuristically.  We
; automatically expand any term on this list when encountered.  It is set from
; the user's hint settings and by simplify-clause to force the expansion of the
; induction conclusion in post-induction, pre-settled down rewriting.

; Case-split-limitations -- typically (sr-limit (w state)), but can be set with
; a :case-split-limitations hint to override that default in the simplifier.

; Force-info -- t if there are no calls of IF in the :top-clause, else 'weak.

; Fns-to-be-ignored-by-rewrite -- a list of function symbols used
; heuristically.  If a term begins with one of these, we do not rewrite it.
; This is set from the user's hint settings.

; Terms-to-be-ignored-by-rewrite -- a list of terms used heuristically.  We do
; not rewrite any term on this list.  Simplify-clause sets it during the
; initial post-induction rewriting to prevent us from looking prematurely at
; the induction hypotheses (see simplify-clause for details).

; Top-clause -- the clause on which simplify-clause was called.  This is used
; heuristically only, to decide whether to expand function calls.  The
; difference between top-clause and current-clause is that current-clause has
; been subjected to remove-trivial-equations.

; Current-clause -- Top-clause with remove-trivial-equations.  This is used
; heuristically only.

; Current-literal -- a pair containing the not-flg and atm of the literal on
; which rewrite-clause is currently working.  It is used to avoid biting our
; tail (see below).  When we are adding a term to the pot-lst, we refuse to add
; the negation of the current literal.

; Nonlinearp -- A boolean indicating whether nonlinear arithmetic should be
; considered to be active.

; Cheap-linearp -- A boolean indicating whether linear arithmetic should avoid
; rewriting terms to turn into polys and avoid adding linear lemmas.

; We always obtain our rewrite-constant by loading relevant information into
; the following empty constant.  Warning: The constant below is dangerously
; useless less the current-enabled-structure is set to an enabled-structure.

; The next major concern is the fact that rewrite takes so many
; arguments.

; Rewrite takes so many arguments that we introduce a macro for
; calling it.  Many functions that call rewrite also take a lot of
; rewrite-type arguments and this macro can be used to call them too.
; Because all of these functions are mutually recursive with rewrite,
; we consider the use of this macro as an indication that we are
; entering the rewriter and have given it the name "rewrite-entry".

; For example, if you write:
;    (rewrite-entry (rewrite-if test left right alist))
; you get
;    (rewrite-if test left right alist type-alist ... rcnst ttree)

; And if you write:
;    (rewrite-entry (rewrite left alist 2)
;                   :ttree new-ttree)
; you get
;    (rewrite left alist 2 ... rcnst new-ttree)

; Note that in specifying which extra arguments you wish to set
; you must use the keyword form of the formal.  This implementation
; decision was made just to bring rewrite-entry into the same style
; as CLTL keyword args, which it resembles.

; The macro extends the given call by adding 12 extra arguments.
; The arguments used are the "extra formals" of rewrite, namely

;    ; &extra formals
;    rdepth type-alist obj geneqv wrld state fnstack ancestors
;    backchain-limit step-limit simplify-clause-pot-lst rcnst gstack ttree

; Important Note:  The string "&extra formals" is included where ever
; this list has been copied.

; However, for every extra formal for which the macro invocation
; specifies a value, that value is used instead.  Any function to be
; called via rewrite-entry should include the extra formals above
; explicitly in its defun, as the last 12 formals.

; Convention: Not every function uses all 12 of the extra formals.
; Ignored formals are so declared.  It is our convention when calling
; a function with an ignored formal to pass it nil in that slot.  That
; explains some (rewrite-entry (add-poly...) :obj nil...).  We could have
; just passed obj's current value, but that suffers from making the
; caller look like it uses obj when in fact obj might be ignored by it
; too.  This convention means that if one of these functions does
; begin to use a currently ignored formal, it will be necessary to
; remove the formal from the (declare (ignore ...)) and might cause us
; to think about the incoming value.

; Essay on "Break-Rewrite"
; Essay on BRR

; We wish to develop the illusion of a recursive function we will call
; "break-rewrite".  In particular, when a rule is to be applied by
; rewrite-with-lemma and that rule is monitored (i.e., its rune is on
; brr-monitored-runes) then we imagine the rule is actually applied by
; "break-rewrite", which is analogous to rewrite-with-lemma but instrumented to
; allow the user to watch the attempt to apply the rule.  Rewrite-fncall and
; add-linear-lemma are similarly affected.  Because we find "break-rewrite" a
; tedious name (in connection with user-available macros for accessing context
; sensitive information) we shorten it to simply brr when we need a name that
; is connected with the implementation of "break-rewrite."  There is no
; "break-rewrite" function -- its presence is an illusion -- and we reserve the
; string "break-rewrite" to refer to this mythical function.

; Rather than actually implement "break-rewrite" we sprinkle "break points"
; through the various rewrite functions.  These break points are the functions
; brkpt1 and brkpt2.  The reason we do this is so that we don't have to
; maintain two parallel versions of rewrite-with-lemma (and others) as
; discussed above.  It is not clear this is justification for what is a
; surprisingly complicated alternative, especially since a recursive call to
; the rewriter would make it possible to :EVAL more than once.  (For example,
; if the :EVAL says that the attempt failed because hyp 3 rewrote to xyz, we
; might want to :monitor some other rules and do the :EVAL again to see what
; went wrong.)  But since we haven't pursued any other approach, it is not
; clear that the complications are isolated in this one.

; The main complication is that if we really had a recursive "break-rewrite"
; then we could have local variables associated with each attempt to apply a
; given rule.  This would allow us, for example, to set a variable early in
; "break-rewrite" and then test it late, without having to worry that recursive
; calls of "break-rewrite" in between will see the setting.  An additional
; complication is that to interact with the user we must enter a wormhole and
; thus have no effect on the state.

; Our first step is to implement a slightly different interface to wormholes that
; will provide us with global variables that retain their values from one exit to
; the next entrance but that can be overwritten conveniently upon entrance.  See
; brr-wormhole below.  Assume that we have such a wormhole interface providing
; what we call "brr-globals."

; We use the notion of brr-globals to implement "brr-locals."  Of course, what
; we implement is a stack.  That stack is named brr-stack and it is a
; brr-global.  By virtue of being a brr-global it retains its value from one
; call of brr-wormhole to the next.

; Imagine then that we have this stack.  Its elements are frames.  Each frame
; specifies the local bindings of various variables.  Inside brkpt1 and brkpt2
; we access these "brr-locals" via the top-most frame on the stack.  Brkpt1
; pushes a new frame, appropriately binding the locals.  brkpt2 pops that frame
; when it exits "break-rewrite".

; For sanity, each frame will contain the gstack for the brkpt1 that built it.
; Any function accessing a brr-local will present its own gstack as proof that
; it is accessing the right frame.  One might naively assume that the presented
; gstack will always be equal to the gstack in the top-most frame and that
; failure of this identity check might as well signal a hard error.  How might
; this error occur?  The most obvious route is that we have neglected to pop a
; frame upon exit from the virtual "break-rewrite", i.e., we have forgotten to
; call brkpt2 on some exit of rewrite-with-lemma.  More devious is the
; possibility that brkpt2 was called but failed to pop because we have
; misinterpreted our various flags and locally monitored runes.  These routes
; argue for a hard error because they ought never to occur and the error
; clearly indicates a coding mistake.  But it is possible for the stack to get
; "out of sync" in an entirely user controlled way!

; Suppose we are in brkpt1.  It has pushed a frame with the current gstack.
; The user, typing to "break-rewrite" (the brr-wormhole in brkpt1) invokes the
; theorem prover and we enter another brkpt1.  It pushes its frame.  The user
; issues the command to proceed (i.e., to attempt to establish the hypotheses).
; The inner brkpt1 is terminated and control returns to rewrite.  Note that we
; are still in the inner "break-rewrite" because we are pursuing the hyps of
; the inner rule.  Consistent with this note is the fact that the stack
; contains two frames, the top-most one being that pushed by the inner brkpt1.
; Control is flowing toward the inner brkpt2 where, normally, the user would
; see the results of trying to establish the inner hyps.  But then the user
; aborts.  Control is thrown to the outer brkpt1, because all of this action
; has occurred in response to a recursive invocation of the theorem prover from
; within that wormhole.  But now the stack at that brkpt1 is out of sync: the
; gstack of the wormhole is different from the gstack in the top-most frame.
; So we see that this situation is unavoidable and must be handled gracefully.

; Therefore, to access the value of a brr-local we use a function which
; patiently looks up the stack until it finds the right frame.  It simply
; ignores "dead" frames along the way.  We could pop them off, but then we
; would have to side-effect state to update the stack.  The way a frame binds
; local variables is simply in an alist.  If a variable is not bound at the
; right frame we scan on up the stack looking for the next binding.  Thus,
; variables inherit their bindings from higher levels of "break-rewrite" as
; though the function opened with (let ((var1 var1) (var2 var2) ...) ...).
; When we "pop a frame" we actually pop all the frames up to and including the
; one for the gstack presented to pop.  Finally, we need the function that
; empties the stack.

; So much for the overview.  We begin by implementing brr-wormholes and
; brr-globals.

; While a normal wormhole provides one "global variable" that persists over
; entries and exits (namely, in the wormhole data field of the
; wormhole-status), the brr-wormhole provides several.  These are called
; "brr-globals."  The implementation of brr-globals is in two places: entry to
; and exit from the wormhole.  The entry modification is to alter the supplied
; form so that it first moves the variable values from the wormhole-input and
; previous wormhole-status vectors into true state global variables.  See
; brr-wormhole.  The exit modification is to provide exit-brr-wormhole which
; moves the final values of the globals to the wormhole-status vector to be
; preserved for the next entrance.

; NOTE: To add a new brr-global, look for all the functions containing the
; string "Note: To add a new brr-global" and change them appropriately.  No
; other changes are necessary (except, of course, passing in the desired values
; for the new global and using it).

; See the Essay on "Break-Rewrite".  Stack is a list of frames.  Each frame is
; of the form (gstack' . alist), where the frames are ordered so that each
; successive gstack' is at a higher level than the previous one.  (But note
; that they do not ascend in increments of one.  That is, suppose the
; top frame of stack is marked with gstack' and the next-to-top frame is
; marked with gstack''.  Then gstack' is an extension of gstack'', i.e.,
; some cdr of gstack' is gstack''.  We sweep down stack looking for
; the frame marked by gstack.  We return the stack that has this frame on
; top, or else we return nil.

; We used (Version_2.7 and earlier) to cause a hard error if we did
; not find a suitable frame because we thought it indicated a coding
; error.  Now we just return the empty stack because this situation
; can arise through interrupt processing.  Suppose we are in rewrite
; and push a new frame with brkpt1.  We're supposed to get to brkpt2
; eventually and pop it.  An interrupt could prevent that, leaving the
; frame unpopped.  Suppose that is the last time a brkpt occurs in
; that simplification.  Then the old stack survives.  Suppose the
; waterfall carries out an elim and then brings us back to
; simplification.  Now the gstack is completely different but the
; preserved brr-stack in *wormhole-status-alist* is still the old one.
; Clearly, we should ignore it -- had no interrupt occurred it would
; have been popped down to nil.

; Essay on Correctness of Meta Reasoning

; Below, we sketch a proof of a theorem asserting the correctness of ACL2's
; meta reasoning, starting with meta rules and then handling clause processor
; rules.  We state correctness for extended metafunctions, but correctness for
; ordinary metafunctions follows trivially by adding mfc and state as ignored
; arguments.  We assume a call of hyp-fn in the meta rule, but of course this
; too is fully general; just define hyp-fn to return 't if it is not already
; present.  We also assume that the metatheorem includes hypotheses of
; (pseudo-termp term) and (alistp a), but of course the metatheorem then
; applies if it omits these hypotheses -- just weaken it by adding them back
; in!  And of course, the mention of meta-extract-hyps is harmless if there are
; no meta-extract hypotheses; in that case, meta-extract-hyps is the empty
; conjunction.

; Let *mfc* be a metafunction context, and let {*mfc*} denote the formula
; asserting the validity of *mfc*, as based on its type-alist.  For example, if
; *mfc* has only one entry in its type-alist, and that entry binds (foo x) to
; (ts-complement *ts-integer*), then {*mfc*} is (not (integerp (foo x))).  For
; notational convenience, we write "ev" below for a function symbol that is
; definitely not the predefined ACL2 ev function!

; Theorem.  Suppose that the following is a theorem, where the only axioms for
; ev are evaluator axioms, where term, a, mfc, and state are variables with
; those exact names (clearly this theorem then generalizes to more arbitrary
; variables) and META-EXTRACT-HYPS is explained below.

;   (implies (and (pseudo-termp term)
;                 (alistp a)
;                 META-EXTRACT-HYPS ; see below
;                 (ev (hyp-fn term mfc state) a))
;            (equal (ev term a)
;                   (ev (meta-fn term mfc state) a)))

; Suppose in addition that LHS, HYP, and RHS are terms, and that in an
; environment where term is bound to 'LHS, mfc is bound to *mfc* (the current
; metafunction context), and state is bound to the live ACL2 state, the
; following conditions hold, where evaluation may use attachments.

;   (hyp-fn term mfc state) evaluates to 'HYP;
;   (meta-fn term mfc state) evaluates to 'RHS; and
;   META-EXTRACT-HYPS is a conjunction of meta-extract hypotheses,
;     as recognized by remove-meta-extract-contextual-hyps and
;     remove-meta-extract-global-hyps

; Let EXTRA-FNS be a set of 0, 1, or 2 symbols consisting of
; meta-extract-contextual-fact, meta-extract-global-fact+, or both, according
; to which have top-level calls among meta-extract-hyps.

; Finally, assume the following: ev is not ancestral in any defaxiom, in
; meta-fn, in hyp-fn, or in EXTRA-FNS; no ancestor of ev or EXTRA-FNS with an
; attachment is ancestral in meta-fn or hyp-fn; and no ancestor of any defaxiom
; has an attachment.  (See chk-evaluator-use-in-rule for enforcement.)

; Then the following is a theorem of (mfc-world *mfc*), or equivalently (since
; the worlds have the same logical theory), (w *the-live-state*):

;   (implies (and {*mfc*}
;                 HYP)
;            (equal LHS RHS)).

; The proof of the theorem above uses the following lemma.

; Evaluator Elimination Lemma.  Assume that u is a term, ev is an evaluator for
; the function symbols in u, and a0 is a term of the form (list (cons 'v1 t1)
; ... (cons 'vn tn)) where (v1 ... vn) includes all variables occurring free in
; u and each ti is a term.  Let s be the substitution mapping vi to ti (1 <= i
; <= n).  Then the following is a theorem:

;   (ev 'u a0) = u/s

; Proof:  An easy induction on the structure of term u.  Q.E.D.

; As a warmup, we first prove the theorem in the special case that
; META-EXTRACT-HYPS is the empty conjunction and there are no attachments
; involved.  Let (v1 .. vn) be the variables occurring free in lhs, rhs, or
; hyp.  Let A0 be the term

;   (list (cons 'v1 v1) ... (cons 'vn vn)).

; We instantiate the assumed theorem

;   (implies (and (pseudo-termp term)
;                 (alistp a)
;                 (ev (hyp-fn term mfc state) a))
;            (equal (ev term a) (ev (meta-fn term mfc state) a)))

; replacing term by 'LHS, a by A0, mfc by *mfc*, and state by the live state,
; to obtain the following.

;   (implies (and (pseudo-termp 'LHS)
;                 (alistp A0)
;                 (ev (hyp-fn 'LHS *mfc* *the-live-state*) A0))
;            (equal (ev 'LHS A0)
;                   (ev (meta-fn 'LHS *mfc* *the-live-state*) A0)))

; which is provably equal, by computation, to the following (assuming no
; attachments are used in the computation; we consider attachments later):

;   (implies (ev 'HYP A0)
;            (equal (ev 'LHS A0) (ev 'RHS A0)))

; By functional instantiation, we may replace ev in the hypotheses of the
; theorem by an "extended" evaluator for a set of function symbols including
; all those that occur in hyp, lhs, or rhs.  (A long comment in
; defaxiom-supporters justifies this use of functional instantiation.)  Then by
; the Evaluator Elimination Lemma the formula above simplifies to

;   (implies HYP
;            (equal LHS RHS))

; as desired.

; We next consider the general case, where there may be meta-extract hypotheses
; and attachments may be used.  To start, note that the following is a theorem,
; as it results from the assumed theorem by strengthening hypotheses.  (Here we
; write obj1, obj2, st, and aa for variables not occurring elsewhere in the
; formula.)

;   (implies
;    (and (pseudo-termp term)
;         (alistp a)
;         (forall (obj1)
;                 (ev (meta-extract-contextual-fact obj1 mfc state) a))
;         (forall (obj2 st2 aa)
;                 (ev (meta-extract-global-fact+ obj2 st2 state) aa))
;         (ev (hyp-fn term mfc state) a))
;    (equal (ev term a) (ev (meta-fn term mfc state) a)))

; We instantiate as before, to obtain:

;   (implies
;    (and (pseudo-termp 'LHS)
;         (alistp A0)
;         (forall (obj1)
;          (ev (meta-extract-contextual-fact obj1 *mfc* *the-live-state*)
;              A0))
;         (forall (obj2 st2 aa)
;          (ev (meta-extract-global-fact+ obj2 st2 *the-live-state*) aa))
;         (ev (hyp-fn 'LHS *mfc* *the-live-state*) A0))
;    (equal (ev 'LHS A0)
;           (ev (meta-fn 'LHS *mfc* *the-live-state*) A0)))

; As before, this reduces by computation to the following theorem.

;   (implies
;    (and (forall (obj1)
;          (ev (meta-extract-contextual-fact obj1 *mfc* *the-live-state*)
;              A0))
;         (forall (obj2 st2 aa)
;          (ev (meta-extract-global-fact+ obj2 st2 *the-live-state*) aa))
;         (ev 'hyp A0))
;    (equal (ev 'LHS A0) (ev 'RHS A0)))

; We now deal with attachments; feel free to skip this paragraph on a first
; read.  If attachments are used, then the formula displayed just above is
; actually a theorem in the current evaluation theory, because of the use of
; computation; we now argue that it is also a theorem of the current logical
; world.  Consider the evaluation history h_e obtained from the current logical
; world by considering only attachment pairs <f,g> for which f is ancestral in
; hyp-fn or meta-fn.  The Attachment Restriction Lemma in the Essay on
; Defattach justifies that h_e is indeed an evaluation history.  The
; computations above use only attachments in h_e, because it is closed under
; ancestors (also see the comment about mbe in constraint-info).  So the
; formula displayed just above is a theorem of h_e.  But by hypothesis, no
; ancestor of ev or EXTRA-FNS with an attachment occurs in h_e.  So for the
; history h1 obtained by closing ev and EXTRA-FNS under ancestors in h_e
; (including defaxioms, which never have ancestors with attachments, by the
; Defaxiom Restriction for Defattach; see the Essay on Defattach), h1 contains
; no attachments.  But h_e is conservative over h1 (a standard property of
; histories), so by definition of conservativity, the formula displayed above
; is a theorem of h1.  Since h1 is contained in the current logical world, that
; formula is also a theorem of the current logical world.  So we justifiably
; ignore attachments for the remainder of this discussion.

; Now we functionally instantiate as before, this time after introducing an
; evaluator ev' that includes all currently known function symbols, thus
; obtaining a world w' extending the current logical world, w.

;   (implies
;    (and (forall (obj1)
;          (ev' (meta-extract-contextual-fact obj1 *mfc* *the-live-state*)
;               A0))
;         (forall (obj2 st2 aa)
;          (ev' (meta-extract-global-fact+ obj2 st2 *the-live-state*) aa))
;         (ev' 'HYP A0))
;    (equal (ev' 'LHS A0) (ev' 'RHS A0)))

; As before, the Evaluator Elimination Lemma yields that the following is a
; theorem of w'.

;   (implies
;    (and (forall (obj1)
;          (ev' (meta-extract-contextual-fact obj1 *mfc* *the-live-state*)
;               A0))
;         (forall (obj2 st2 aa)
;          (ev' (meta-extract-global-fact+ obj2 st2 *the-live-state*) aa))
;         HYP)
;    (equal LHS RHS))

; Thus, it remains only to modify the rest of the original argument by dealing
; with the two universally quantified hypotheses.

; Our first step is to show that the second universally quantified hypothesis,
; where we may as well ignore the forall quantifier, is a theorem of w'.  Let
; term0 be the value returned by (meta-extract-global-fact+ obj2 st2
; *the-live-state*).  Since (ev' *t* aa) is provably equal to *t*, let us
; assume without loss of generality that term0 is not *t*, .  The first case we
; consider is that obj2 is not of the form (:FNCALL fn arglist).  Then we
; claim, without proof (but by appeal to plausibility!), that term0 is provably
; a member of the finite list ('THM1 'THM2 ...), where (THM1 THM2 ...)
; enumerates the theorems of w that can be returned by rewrite-rule-term and
; meta-extract-formula when called by meta-extract-global-fact+.  We thus need
; to show that for each member 'THM of this list, (ev' 'THM aa) is a theorem of
; w'.  By the (argument of the) Evaluator Elimination Lemma, (ev' 'THM aa) is
; provably equal to the instance of THM obtained by replacing each variable x
; by the term (cdr (assoc 'x aa)).  Since THM is a theorem of w and hence w',
; so is this instance.  It remains to consider the other case, i.e., to show
; that for obj2 = (:FNCALL fn arglist), (ev' term0 aa) is a theorem of w'.
; Since we are assuming that term0 is not *t*, we know that (w st2) = (w
; *the-live-state*), which is w, and we also know (by inspection of the
; definition of fncall-term) that term0 = (fncall-term fn arglist st2) for a
; logic-mode function symbol fn of w whose input arity is the length of
; arglist.  But (fncall-term fn arglist st2) is the term (equal (fn . arglist)
; 'val) where (magic-ev-fncall fn arglist st2 ...) = (mv nil val).  We arrange
; that magic-ev-fncall has unknown constraints, but we conceive of it as being
; axiomatized using clocked, logic mode definitions that follow the definitions
; supporting ev-fncall -- in particular, a clocked, logic-mode version of
; ev-fncall-rec-logical -- such that (mv t nil) is returned when the clock
; expires.  (All of those functions are conceptually in the ground-zero theory,
; but they need not be defined in the ACL2 system implementation.)  Then the
; top-level recursive function is called with a clock that is greater than all
; clocks that would ever be needed for termination under this story for actual
; calls made.  Thus, for every input term, the value returned by ev-fncall is
; provably equal to the value returned by magic-ev-fncall.

; Thus, we now know that the following is a theorem of w':

; (*)
;   (implies
;    (and (forall (obj1)
;          (ev' (meta-extract-contextual-fact obj1 *mfc* *the-live-state*)
;               A0))
;         HYP)
;    (equal LHS RHS))

; Recall that we are trying to show that the following is a theorem of w.

;   (implies
;    (and {*mfc*}
;         HYP)
;    (equal LHS RHS))

; Since the introduction of ev' makes w' a conservative extension of w, it
; suffices to show that the formula just above is a theorem of w'.  Since (*)
; has been shown to be a theorem of w', then it suffices to show that the
; following is a theorem of w'.

; (+)
;   (implies
;    {*mfc*}
;    (forall (obj1)
;     (ev' (meta-extract-contextual-fact obj1 *mfc* *the-live-state*) A0)))

; But we now argue that this is indeed a theorem.  Informally, we think of it
; as a way to formalize the spec for meta-extract-contextual-fact: that it only
; produces terms that evaluate to true.  To see why (+) is a theorem, we focus
; on the case that obj has the form (:rw term obj nil).  Then the above call of
; meta-extract-contextual-fact is equal to a term of the form (equal lhs0
; rhs0), where rhs0 is the result of applying mfc-rw-fn to lhs0, *mfc*, and a
; state whose world is w, the world of *mfc*.  The key is that in such a case,
; mfc-rw-fn rewrites a term to one that is equal to it with respect to the
; hypotheses of *mfc* including its world, w.  A little more precisely, we
; arrange that mfc-rw-fn -- and mfc-ts-fn, and so on -- all have
; unknown-constraints, but we conceive of those constraints as coming from
; clocked, logic mode versions of corresponding prover routines.  For example,
; we conceive of the definition of mfc-rw-fn as following the definition of
; rewrite, but with a clock and using analogous logic-mode supporting functions
; (just as discussed above for magic-ev-fncall), so that the original term is
; returned if the clock expires.  That clock has an initial value that is
; greater than all clocks that could be needed for termination in support of
; all calls ever actually made, in the sense of this story.  This approach
; guarantees that any value computed by rewrite can be legitimately used as a
; value returned by mfc-rw-fn; that is, the returned value is provably equal to
; the call of mfc-rw-fn on its inputs.  But by the (conceived) definition of
; mfc-rw-fn as a logic mode function, the proof obligations pertaining to
; mfc-rw-fn for (+) are provable.  By extending this argument to other mfc-
; functions, we see that (+) is a theorem.

; It remains to modify the arguments above in the case of clause-processors.
; The terms in META-EXTRACT-HYPS are then all calls of
; meta-extract-global-fact+, not meta-extract-contextual-fact.  The argument
; then proceeds in analogy to how it went before, thus for example replacing
; (ev' 'HYP A0) by (forall aa (ev' 'CLAUSES-RESULT aa)), where CLAUSES-RESULT
; is the formal conjunction of the (disjunctions of the) clauses returned by
; the clause-processor.  This hypothesis is a theorem (by the Evaluator
; Elimination Lemma), however, because by hypothesis, these clauses are all
; theorems.

; We remark briefly on the relation between guards and ancestors in our
; criterion for using attachments in meta-level reasoning.  Above, we argue
; that we can restrict to attachments to functions ancestral in metafunctions
; or clause-processors.  But how do we know that evaluation produces theorems
; in the resulting evaluation history?  If raw-Lisp functions installed by ACL2
; involve mbe, then we need to know that their guards hold.  Thus we need to
; know that the guard proof obligation holds when a function is calling its
; attachment.  This was in essence proved when the defattach event was
; admitted, but after applying the entire functional substitution of that
; event.  Thus, we include guards in our notion of ancestor so that this guard
; obligation clearly holds; see the calls of canonical-ancestors-lst in
; function chk-evaluator-use-in-rule.

; So, we enrich the notion of ancestor to include guards.  However, we can
; weaker our notion of ancestor to avoid the next-to-last argument of
; return-last, except when it is used to implement mbe (see function
; canonical-ffn-symbs).  This weakening was inspired by an example sent to us
; by Sol Swords, who derived it from his own experience, and is justified by
; imagining that all such calls of return-last are expanded away before storing
; events.  The parameter rlp passed to our functions is true when this special
; handling of return-last is to be performed.

; We attempt to keep all terms in quote-normal form, which explains the use of
; sublis-var-lst below.  There are also three related calls, all of the form
; (sublis-var nil X), in rewrite-with-lemma.

; We wondered if for large problems, the cost of exploring large terms might
; not be worth the benefit of maintaining quote-normal form, so we tried
; replacing the pairlis$ call below with, simply, alist.  However, we found
; relatively little benefit, as we now describe.

; Below are timings from 4 different configurations.  In all cases, we
; abstained from doing anything else on the laptop during the run.  So the
; differences you see are real, up to GC time.  All the runs were conducted
; sequentially in the same image.
;
; The first configuration, A, is as reported in the Stateman paper (by J Moore)
; at the 2015 ACL2 Workshop.  The relevant fact is that sublis-var1 is memoized
; when the substitution is nil and the term has a HIDE on it.  Three runs were
; done to see if the time would stabilize.  The time reported in the paper was
; 275 seconds.
;
; ; A runs:
; ; 388.94 seconds realtime, 382.18 seconds runtime
; ; 265.68 seconds realtime, 262.71 seconds runtime
; ; 274.68 seconds realtime, 272.27 seconds runtime
;
; The next configuration is the same as A except that here, sublis-var1 is not
; memoized.  So here you see the extra cost of the sublis-var nil calls.
;
; ; B runs:
; ; 485.81 seconds realtime, 482.91 seconds runtime
; ; 494.81 seconds realtime, 491.70 seconds runtime
;
; The next configuration is with the change described above, as follows: we
; replaced the pairlis$ call with the variable, alist, and replaced each
; (sublis-var nil X) call in rewrite-with-lemma by the corresponding X.  Note
; that sublis-var is not memoized here either.
;
; ; C runs:
; ; 281.10 seconds realtime, 278.37 seconds runtime
; ; 284.11 seconds realtime, 281.30 seconds runtime
;
; So eliminating the call has about the same effect on time as memoizing it.
;
; The final experiment leaves memoization on (for sublis-var1 with nil
; substitution and a term beginning with HIDE) but also includes the
; modifications described above, that is, to avoid the (sublis-var nil ...)
; call in this function and the three such calls in rewrite-with-lemma.

; D runs:
; 273.10 seconds realtime, 270.52 seconds runtime
; 299.00 seconds realtime, 277.31 seconds runtime

; This suggests that memoizing sublis-var as Stateman does and eliminating
; these sublis-var calls is marginally worse than just memoizing sublis-var (as
; in A).  That seems rather unlikely, so we are willing to conclude that the
; differences are just noise.  So we have decided to keep these four calls of
; sublis-var-lst or sublis-var, which will avoid the potential pain of
; modifying some books to accommodate their removal.  (Actually no regression
; books as of early November 2015 needed to be modified; but other user books
; might need to be.)

(defrec rw-cache-entry

; This structure is a record of a failed attempt at relieve-hyps.  The
; :step-limit is set to the step-limit upon entry to the failed relieve-hyps
; call.

; There are two cases, which we call the "normal-failure" case and the
; "free-failure" case.  In the free-failure case, a preceding hypothesis bound
; a free variable without using bind-free or being a binding hypothesis;
; otherwise, we are in the normal-failure case.

; Consider first the normal-failure case.  Then the :unify-subst is the
; restriction of a failed attempt to rewrite the nth hypothesis, stored in
; :hyp-info, to true, where the :failure-reason has the form (n . &), and the
; indexing is one-based.

; In the free-failure case, failure-reason is a structure satisfying
; free-failure-p, i.e.  of the form (:RW-CACHE-ALIST . alist), where each key
; of alist is a unify-subst and each value is a failure reason (either
; normal-failure or recursively of this form).  We sometimes call alist an
; "rw-cache-alist".  The :hyp-info field contains the :hyps field of the
; rewrite-rule, and the :step-limit is as above.  The following example
; illustrates the form of the :failure-reason.  Suppose we have a rewrite rule
; whose left-hand side has variables x1 and x2, such that hypothesis 2 binds
; free variable y and hypothesis 6 binds free variable z.  Suppose that when
; binding x1 to a1 and x2 to a2 we find:

; - bind y to b1
;    - obtained failure-reason-1 at hypothesis 4
; - bind y to b2
;    - bind z to c1
;      - obtained failure-reason-2 at hypothesis 8
;    - bind z to c2
;      - obtained failure-reason-3 at hypothesis 8

; Then the :unify-subst is ((x1 . a1) (x2 . a2)), and the corresponding
; :failure-reason looks as follows.

; (:RW-CACHE-ALIST
;  (((y . b1) (x1 . a1) (x2 . a2)) ; unify-subst
;   . failure-reason-1)
;  (((y . b2) (x1 . a1) (x2 . a2)) ; unify-subst
;   . (:RW-CACHE-ALIST
;      (((z . c1) (y . b2) (x1 . a1) (x2 . a2)) ; unify-subst
;       . failure-reason-2)
;      (((z . c2) (y . b2) (x1 . a1) (x2 . a2)) ; unify-subst
;       . failure-reason-3))))

; Note that if for example we bind y to b3 at hypothesis 2 and fail by finding
; no binding of z at hypothesis 6, then we do not store a failure-reason; and
; this is reasonable, because maybe a later context will find a binding of z.
; Another way to look at this case is to notice that above, we are storing a
; failure reason for each binding of z; so if there are no bindings of z, then
; there is nothing to store!

; We use lexorder a lot, so we put the step-limit field first.

; Comments on the function REWRITE

; The Input
; c term:        the "matrix" term we are to rewrite.
; c alist:       a substitution we are to apply to term before rewriting it.
; h type-alist:  a list of assumptions governing this rewrite
;   obj:         (objective of rewrite) t, nil, or ? - of heuristic use only.
; c geneqv:      a generated equivalence relation to maintain
; c pequiv-info: info on patterned equivalence relations (pequivs) to maintain
;   wrld:        the current world
;   fnstack:     fns and terms currently being expanded - of heuristic use only
; h ancestors:   a list of terms assumed true, modified as we backchain.
; h backchain-limit: of heuristic use only
; h simplify-clause-pot-lst: a pot-lst of polys
; h rcnst:       the rewrite constant arguments
; h ttree:       the evolving ttree describing the rewrites.
;   rdepth:      maximum allowed stack depth - of heuristic use only
;   step-limit:  number of recursive calls permitted for rewrite

; The Output:
; a new step-limit, a term term', and a tag-tree ttree'

; The Specification of Rewrite: The axioms in wrld permit us to infer that the
; Rewrite Assumption implies that term' is equivalent via geneqv+pequiv-info to
; term/alist.  One can write this "wrld |- h -> c."  The args are tagged with h
; and c according to how they are involved in this spec.

; The Rewrite Assumption: the conjunction of (a) the assumptions in type-alist,
; (b) the assumptions in ancestors, (c) the assumption of every "active" poly
; in simplify-clause-pot-lst (where a poly is inactive iff its tag-tree
; contains a 'pt containing some literal number that occurs in the :pt field of
; rcnst), and (d) the 'assumptions in the final tag-tree ttree'.

; Observe that if there are 'assumptions in the incoming ttree they are unioned
; into those made by this rewrite.  Thus, unless you want the assumptions to
; accumulate across many rewrites, you must use the empty initial tag-tree.  It
; would be incorrect to attempt to split on the "new" assumptions in the new
; tag-tree because of the unioning.

; The first value is the rewritten term.  The second is the final
; value of ttree.

; When we rewrite the test of the if we use geneqv iff.  What about

; Suppose you are rewriting (if t1 'nil 't) with the objective t.
; Then you should rewrite t1 with the objective nil.  This actually
; comes up in the handling of (<= x y).  That term opens to (if (< y
; x) 'nil 't).  If we had an obj of t initially, and we don't look
; into the if to see which way the branches go, then we rewrite the (<

; It is possible that this rewriting will force some hypotheses in a
; ``context free'' way, i.e., forcing might occur while rewriting the
; concl but the forced assumption won't record the hypotheses that
; might actually be necessary to establish the assumption.  This is
; not supposed to happen because the only IMPLIES we should see
; (barring any introduced by user supplied rewrite rules) are in :USE
; hyps, and their hyps are normally provable under the hyps of the
; original theorem -- and those original hyps are in the type-alist
; defining this context.

; Once upon a time, the call of assume-true-false below was replaced by a call
; of repetitious-assume-true-false.  See the Essay on Repetitive Typing.  This
; caused a terrible slowdown in the proof of the Nqthm package theorems (e.g.,
; the proof of AX-20-2 seemed never to complete but was not apparently
; looping).  It was apparently due to the opening of MEMBER on a long constant
; list and each time doing a repetition on an increasingly long type-alist (but
; this is just speculation).  For a simple example of a problem that arises if
; repetition is used here, consider the example problem shown with the Satriani
; hack above.  (Search for make-standard-codes.)  Try that thm both with an
; assume-true-false and a repetitious-assume-true-false here.  The former takes
; 3.87 seconds; the latter takes about 13.37 seconds.  The problem is that we
; keep assuming tests of the form (EQUAL X '#\a) on a type-alist that contains
; a litany of all the chars X is not equal to, i.e., a type-alist containing
; such triples as ((EQUAL X '#\b) 64 ; (*ts-nil*)) for lots of different #\b's.
; On the true branch, we add the pair that X is of type *ts-character* and then
; reconsider every one of the (EQUAL X '#\b) assumptions previously posted.

; Note: Running that example will also illustrate another oddity.  You will see
; successive duplicate calls of assume-true-false on the (EQUAL X '#\a)'s.
; What is happening?  In opening (MEMBER X '(#\a ...)) in rewrite-fncall we
; rewrite the body of member, producing the first call of assume-true-false
; when we consider (equal x (car lst)).  The result of rewriting the body is
; essentially an instance of the body; the recursive call within it is unopened
; because member is recursive (!).  Then we decide to keep the rewrite and
; rewrite the body again.  So we again assume-true-false the instance of the
; just produced (EQUAL X '#\a).

; If ancestors is non-nil, ACL2 is backchaining to relieve the hypothesis of
; some rule.  Conversely, if ancestors is nil, ACL2 is rewriting a term in the
; current clause.  As of v2_8 if ACL2 is backchaining, we use the new and
; stronger assume-true-false capability of milking the linear pot.  We apply
; the extra power when backchaining because ACL2's operations are largely
; invisible to the user when backchaining.  The main effect of using
; assume-true-false this way is to cause recursive definitions to open up a
; little more aggressively.  (Since the simplify-clause-pot-lst is passed in,
; linear arithmetic --- via type-reasoning --- can decide the truth or falsity
; of more inequalities than otherwise, causing more if expressions to
; collapse.  This may eliminate recursive calls that would otherwise be passed
; up to rewrite-fncallp and have to be accepted as heuristically simpler.  It
; could also change the too-many-ifs situation.)  We do not apply the extra
; power when rewriting the current clause, because it is potentially expensive
; and the user can see (and therefore change) what is going on.

; If lhs and rhs are both of type cons, we (essentially) recursively rewrite
; the equality of their cars and then of their cdrs.  If either of these two
; tests fails, this equality is nil.  If both succeed, this one is t.
; Otherwise, we don't rewrite term.

; Before attempting to add complete equality we did not do anything like this
; and relied solely on elim to do it for us.  In the first attempt to add it to
; rewrite we just rewrote all such (EQUAL lhs rhs) to the conjunction of the
; equalities of the components.  That was unsatisfactory because it caused such
; equalities as (EQUAL (ADDTOLIST X L) B) to be torn up all the time.  That
; caused us to fail to prove thms like SORT-OF-ORDERED-NUMBER-LIST because weak
; subgoals are pushed -- subgoals about (CAR (ADDTOLIST X L)) and (CDR
; (ADDTOLIST X L)) instead about (ADDTOLIST X L) itself.

; In Version_3.3 and earlier (even as far back as Version_2.2) we rewrote
; equality terms (equal (car lhs) (car rhs)) and (equal (cdr lhs) (cdr rhs)),
; with variables lhs and rhs bound to the parameters lhs and rhs.  But now we
; instead call the rewriter separately on the car and cdr of lhs and rhs (hence
; "essentially" in a paragraph above).  Then to check equality we finish using
; a recursive call of rewrite-equal with lhs and rhs pushed on to the stacks
; lhs-ancestors and rhs-ancestors (respectively).  We avoid making a recursive
; call if we see that we have looped back to a call with the same lhs or rhs,
; which indicates a potential infinite loop.  When we formerly called the full
; rewriter on (equal (car lhs) (car rhs)) and (equal (cdr lhs) (cdr rhs)), We
; did not make such a check and we found an infinite loop in the following
; example (a slight simplification of one Sol Swords sent to us); see just
; below for analysis.

; (thm (implies (and (consp y)
;                    (consp (car y))
;                    (equal (caar y) y))
;               (equal y (car y))))

; If you try the following trace on the above example using Version_3.3, where
; we called rewrite on applications of equal to the two cars and the two cdrs

; (trace$ (rewrite :entry (list 'rewrite term alist type-alist))
;         (rewrite-equal :entry (list 'r-e lhs rhs type-alist)))

; then you will see a loop as follows.

;  98> (R-E Y
;           (CAR Y)
;           (((CAR (CAR Y)) 1536)
;            ((EQUAL (CAR (CAR Y)) Y) 128) ; 128 = *ts-t*

; The calls of rewrite-equal keep toggling between argument list (Y (CAR Y))
; and ((CAR Y) Y), because when we take the CAR, Y becomes (CAR Y), but (CAR Y)
; becomes (CAR (CAR Y)) which simplifies to Y.  Our loop-breaking mechanism
; clearly avoids this problem.  (An elim is still needed to finish the proof,

; We are trying to rewrite hyp0 to true, where hyp0 is the hypothesis of rune
; at (one-based) position bkptr, and target is an instantiated term to which
; rune is being applied.

; We return six results.  Most often they are interpreted as indicated by the
; names:

; (mv step-limit wonp failure-reason unify-subst' ttree' memo').

; Here wonp is t, nil, :unify-subst-list, or a term.  If it is t, nil, or
; :unify-subst-list, then interpretation of the results is as hinted above:
; wonp indicates whether hyp0 was relieved, failure-reason is nil or else a
; token indicating why we failed, and the rest are extended versions of the
; corresponding inputs except for the case :unify-subst-list, where
; unify-subst' is actually a list of unifying substitutions, each of which is
; sufficient for relieving the remaining hypotheses.

; But there is a special case where they are interpreted quite differently: if
; wonp is a term then it means that hyp0 contains free-vars, it was not
; relieved, and the six results are to be interpreted as follows,
; where the last three are unchanged.

; (mv step-limit term typ unify-subst ttree memo)

; This signals that the caller of relieve-hyp is responsible for relieving the
; hypothesis and may do so in either of two ways: Extend unify-subst to make
; term have typ in the original type-alist or extend unify-subst to make hyp0
; true via ground units.  This is called the SPECIAL CASE.

; This function is a No-Change Loser modulo rw-cache: only the values of
; 'rw-cache-any-tag and 'rw-cache-nil-tag may differ between the input and
; output ttrees.

; Below we describe the memo argument, but first, here is an example that
; illustrates how it is used.

; (defstub p1 (x) t)
; (defstub p2 (x) t)
; (defstub p3 (x) t)
; (defaxiom ax (implies (and (p1 x) (p2 y) (consp x) (symbolp y)) (p3 x)))
; (thm (implies (and (p1 a) (p2 b) (p2 c) (consp a) (symbolp b)) (p3 a)))

; In the proof of thm, a rewrite of (p3 a) triggers application of ax.  Note
; that (p2 c) is in front of (p2 b) on the type-alist.  So, the second
; hypothesis of ax first binds y to c.  Since (symbolp y) fails with this
; binding, we backtrack in the relieving of hyps for ax, and now bind y to b.
; But note that we encounter (consp x) again.  Rather than have to rewrite
; (consp x) again, we save the fact that it was relieved when that happened the
; first time, when y was bound to c.  How do we do this?

; Memo (called "allp" in other functions in this nest) can be an alist with
; entries of the form (n vars (subst0 . ttree0) ... (substk . ttreek)), where n
; is a bkptr, vars is (all-vars hyp0), and ttreei is the result of successfully
; calling relieve-hyp with the following arguments: ttree=nil; bkptr=n;
; unify-subst is some substitution whose restriction to vars is substi; and the
; other arguments are the same.  In these cases substi should bind all the free
; variables of hyp0.  The other legal values of memo are nil, t and :start.  If
; memo is nil or t then we do not memoize, though in the case of t we may start
; memoizing in later calls because we have a free variable.  If memo is :start
; or an alist then we return an extended memo (where :start is viewed as the
; empty memo) if this call of relieve-hyp succeeds and all variables of hyp0
; are bound in unify-subst.

; Note that unlike some other functions in the rewrite clique, here we really
; do care that bkptr is a number representing the hypothesis.

; to the attempt to relieve hyps using extended-unify-subst_i, an extension of
; unify-subst.  The failure-reason-lst is used in
; tilde-@-failure-reason-free-phrase to explain why each attempt at extending
; the unify-subst failed to succeed, except if this list is empty, then a
; 'hyp-vars token is used in its place (see relieve-hyps1).

; nil iff term is a lambda application.  The three values returned by this
; function are the new step-limit, the (possibly) rewritten term, and the new

; Term is of the form (fn . args).

; Nqthm Discrepancy: In nqthm, the caller of rewrite-fncall,
; rewrite-with-lemmas, would ask whether the result was different from term and
; whether it contained rewriteable calls.  If so, it called the rewriter on the
; result.  We have changed that here so that rewrite-fncall, in the case that
; it is returning the expanded body, asks about rewriteable calls and possibly
; calls rewrite again.  In the implementation below we ask about rewriteable
; calls only for recursively defined fns.  The old code asked the question on
; all expansions.  It is possible the old code sometimes found a rewriteable
; call of a non-recursive fn in the expansion of that fn's body because of uses
; of that fn in the arguments.  So this is a possible difference between ACL2
; and nqthm, although we have no reason to believe it is significant and we do
; it only for recursive fns simply because the non-recursive case seems
; unlikely.

; Once upon a time, before we were heavily involved with ACL2 proofs, we had
; the following code here.  Roughly speaking this code forced recursive
; functions to open one step at a time if they introduced any IFs.

;                           ((ffnnamep 'if rewritten-body)

; Nqthm Discrepancy: This clause is new to ACL2.  Nqthm always rewrote the
; rewritten body if it contained rewriteable calls.  This allows Nqthm to open
; up (member x '(a b c d e)) to a 5-way case split in "one" apparent rewrite.
; In an experiment I have added the proviso above, which avoids rewriting the
; rewritten body if it contains an IF.  This effectively slows down the opening
; of member, forcing the whole theorem back through the simplifier on each
; opening.  Eventually it will open completely, even under this rule.  The
; thought, though, is that often the case splits introduced by such openings
; seems to be irrelevant.  Under this new rule, (length (list a b c d e)) will
; expand in one step to '5, but the member expression above will expand more
; slowly because the expansion introduces a case split.  An experiment was done
; with Nqthm-1992 in which this change was introduced and examples/basic/
; proveall.events was replayed without any trouble and with no apparent
; performance change.  There are undoubtedly example files where this change
; will slow things down.  But it was motivated by an example in which it speeds
; things up by a factor of 10 because the opening is totally irrelevant to the
; proof.  The problem -- which was illustrated in the guard proofs for the
; function ascii-code-lst in the nqthm.lisp events -- is that (member x
; *standard-chars*) opens into a 96-way case split in a situation in which it
; could as well have been disabled.  This happens more in ACL2 than in Nqthm
; because of the presence of defconsts which permit big constants to be fed
; to recursive functions.  It is not clear whether this change is an improvement
; or not.

; With further experience, I've decided it is clear that this change is not an

; still a problem.  In particular,

;    (defun ascii-code-lst (lst)

; We desire to rewrite the instantiated conclusion of :LINEAR lemmas
; before adding them to the linear pot.  (We also rewrite with this

; list, when the non-linear package is turned on via set-non-linearp.)
; To avoid tail biting we adopted the policy of rewriting just the
; args of the conclusion.  It is not known whether this is still
; necessary.

; Historical Plaque from Nqthm:

; However, because all of the literals of the clause being proved are on the
; TYPE-ALIST as false, it is possible -- say when proving an instance of an
; already proved :LINEAR lemma -- to rewrite the conclusion to F!  We could
; avoid this by either not putting the linear-like literals on the type alist
; in the first place, or by not rewriting the entire conclusion, just the
; args.  We took the latter approach because it was simplest.  It does suffer
; from the possibility that the whole (< lhs rhs) of the conclusion might
; rewrite to something else, possibly a better <.

; End of Plaque.

; Note that it is not the case that all of the literals of the clause are on
; type-alist!  In rewrite-clause we do not put the current literal on.  During
; the computation of the initial pot-lst in setup-simplify-clause-pot-lst, the
; type-alist is nil.

; We return two things, the rewritten term and the new ttree.

; The best solution would probably be to not rewrite the instantiated
; trigger term in rewrite-linear-term, but that has its own problems
; and is much more work to implement.  By just reverting to the
; un-rewritten concl we catch the ``obvious'' cases such as
; illustrated above.  Note that the un-rewritten concl may also
; linearize to nil, but a regression test using the community books
; actually shows a slight improvement in speed (about a
; minute and a half, out of 158 and a half minutes), so we conclude
; that this is not a problem in practice.

; We thank Robert Krug for providing this improvement.

; Simplify-clause arranges for the following term to be true immediately after
; the clause has settled down.  In that case, we are prepared to try any
; "desperation heuristics", such as (here) linearizing the unrewritten
; conclusion in cases when we would have stopped after linearizing the
; rewritten conclusion.  Below are two examples that motivated this change.

; Example 1.

; Consider the following theorem:
; (<= (len (cdr (cdr (nthcdr n stk))))
;      (len stk))

; A script is below that introduces two linear lemmas that one could reasonably
; expect to suffice for proving this theorem, given the following informal
; proof.

;   (len (cdr (cdr (nthcdr n stk))))
;   <=                                 ; by linear1
;   (len (cdr (nthcdr n stk)))
;   <=                                 ; by linear1
;   (len (nthcdr n stk))
;   <=                                 ; by linear2
;   (len stk)

; Here are the two linear lemmas.

;   (defthm linear1
;     (<= (len (cdr stk)) (len stk))
;     :rule-classes :linear)

;   (defthm linear2
;     (<= (len (nthcdr n stk)) (len stk))
;     :rule-classes :linear)

; The following theorem did not prove until after we added this "desperate
; heuristic" to linearize the unrewritten conclusion.

;   (thm (<= (len (cdr (cdr (nthcdr n stk))))
;            (len stk))
;        :hints (("Goal" :do-not-induct t)))

; Example 2.

; First evaluate these events:

;   (include-book "arithmetic-5/top" :dir :system)
;
;   (defthm mod-linear
;     (implies (and (natp x) (natp k)) (<= (mod x k) x))
;     :rule-classes :linear)
;
;   (encapsulate ((rd (x) t))
;                (local (defun rd (x) (nfix x)))
;                (defthm natp-rd (natp (rd x))
;                  :rule-classes :type-prescription))

; The following proves, and indeed proved (without induction) before the
; change.

;   (thm (<= (mod (rd x) 4)
;            (+ 1 (rd x))))

; But the following theorem only proved after the change.  Naively one wouldn't
; expect the hypothesis to get in the way.  (We are not using induction in this
; example.)  To make matters worse, the hypothesis is provable; the two
; theorems really are equivalent.

;   (thm (implies
;         (< (mod (rd x) 4) 5)
;         (<= (mod (rd x) 4)
;             (+ 1 (rd x)))))

; Warning: It may be tempting to add the following optimization, as was done up
; through Version_3.3.  Don't do it!  The optimization is that under suitable
; hypotheses (see optimization code below): when given 0 < a1 + b1x and 0 < a2
; + b2y, first let a1' = -a1 and b1' = -b1 and then multiply a1' < b1x by a2' <
; b2 y to get a1'a2' < b1b2xy.

; Consider the following example that illustrates the problem with this
; optimization.

; (set-non-linearp t)
; (thm (implies (and (rationalp x) (< 3 x)
;                    (rationalp y) (< 4 y))
;               (< 0 (+ 12 (* -4 x) (* -3 y) (* x y)))))

; With the optimization shown below, the proof fails, because the hypotheses
; only generate the weaker inequality (< 0 (+ -12 (* x y))).  This inequality,
; which we will name In0, is weaker than the thm's conclusion above because
; under the thm's hypotheses, we have (< (* -4 x) -12) and (< (* -3 x) -12),
; and adding these inequalities to the thm's conclusion yields In0.  In0 is
; strictly weaker than the thm's conclusion: consider x=13 and y=1, which makes
; In0 true but makes the thm's conclusion false.  Of course, that example
; doesn't take into account the hypotheses on x and y above, so the following
; example may be more persuasive.  Consider abstracting (* x y) to a new
; variable z, and consider whether the weaker inequality implies the stronger
; -- if so, then we would expect linear arithmetic reasoning to be able to
; derive the stronger from the weaker when necessary.

; (implies (and (rationalp x) (< 3 x)
;               (rationalp y) (< 4 y)
;               (rationalp z) (< 12 z))
;          (< 0 (+ 12 (* -4 x) (* -3 y) z)))

; But this is not a theorem -- consider x = y = z = 100.

; Here, then, is the optimization code to avoid:

; (if (and (rationalp const1)

; The following examples from Robert Krug illustrate issues pertaining to the
; above "optimization".  First note that the following fails with the
; optimization.  We have labeled interesting hypotheses for an explanation
; below.

; (set-non-linearp t)
; (thm
;  (implies (and (rationalp i)
;                (rationalp n)
;                (rationalp r)
;                (<= 1 i)      ; [1]
;                (<= 1 n)      ; [2]
;                (< r 0)       ; [3]
;                (< (- i) r))  ; [4]
;           (<= 0 (+ r (* i n)))))

; However, if in this formula we change r to a, and/or if we comment out the
; hypothesis (<= 1 i), then we succeed with or without the optimization,
; i.e. in Version_3.3 or beyond.

; First, consider how commenting out [1] can help.  ACL2 can add hypotheses [3]
; and [4] about r to generate 0 < i.  This can be multiplied by [2] (in the
; form 0 <= -1 + n) to generate an i*n term.  This product -- performed without
; the optimization, since 0 < i has a constant of zero -- is 0 < -i + i*n.
; This adds to [4] to yield the conclusion.  BUT if [1] is around, it subsumes
; generated inequality 0 < i, and then with the optimization, hypotheses [1]
; and [2] generate 1 <= i*n, and we claim that the conclusion no longer follows
; by linear reasoning.  To verify this claim, treat i*n as a variable by
; replacing it with z, and then notice that the following evaluates to NIL:

; (let ((i 10) (n 10) (r -5) (z 1))
;   (implies (and (rationalp i)
;                 (rationalp n)
;                 (rationalp r)
;                 (rationalp z)
;                 (<= 1 i)      ; [1]
;                 (<= 1 n)      ; [2]
;                 (< r 0)       ; [3]
;                 (< (- i) r)   ; [4]
;                 (<= 1 z))     ; generated, with i*n abstracted
;            (<= 0 (+ r z))))

; Second, consider how changing r to a can help.  We have the following.

; (thm
;  (implies (and (rationalp i)
;                (rationalp n)
;                (rationalp a)
;                (<= 1 i)      ; [1]
;                (<= 1 n)      ; [2]
;                (< a 0)       ; [3]
;                (< (- i) a))  ; [4]
;           (<= 0 (+ a (* i n)))))

; This time, [4] is about i, not r.  So in order to obtain an i*n term, we can
; multiply [4] (actually 0 < i + a) by [2] (actually 0 <= -1 + n), and what's
; more, there is no "optimization" since [4] has a constant of 0.
; Multiplication gives us: 0 < -i + i*n - a + a*n.  We add this to the negated
; conclusion, 0 < -a - i*n, to obtain 0 < -i - 2*a + a*n.  We combine this with
; [4] to obtain 0 < -a + a*n.  We then generate an inequality about a*n by
; multiplying [2] and [3] (without optimization, since [3] has a constant of 0)
; to obtain 0 < a - a*n.  Adding this to the previous result yields a
; contradiction.

; Inverse-var is the multiplicative inverse of new-var,

; for multiplication from (see non-linear-arithmetic), and
; pot-lst-to-step-down is the pot-lst we cdr down as we recurse
; through this function.  They are initially the same pot
; list.  Products-already-tried is an accumulator which keeps track of
; which pots we have already tried multiplying the polys from.

; Division can cause problems.  For a simple example, consider:
; p1: 0 < b
; p2: b < a
; and imagine we are trying to prove
; p: 1 < a/b.
; by adding its negation and looking for a contradiction.
; The presence of the /b in the pot will cause inverse-polys to give us
; p3: 0 < 1/b
; But deal-with-factors and deal-with-products will not have a poly
; ``about'' a to multiply p3 by, because a is not the heaviest term in
; any poly.  Rather, what we want to do is multiply p3 and p2 since
; b/b = 1.  (Note that before we invoke deal-with-division, we insure
; that we have good bounds for b in the pot.  This insures that b/b
; disappears without a case split.)

; Another example is that
; p1: 0 < a
; p2: a < b
; imply
; p: 1 < b/a.
; The last will be stored as
; p3: b/a <= 1.
; If we multiply p1 and p3 and cancel we get
; p4: 0 <= a - b
; or
; p4: b <= a
; which contradicts p2.

; So, what we do here is see if there is a pot whose label has inverse-var
; as a factor, and, if so, multiply two sets of polys and add the
; resultant polys to the pot-lst.  The two sets of polys we multiply are:
; (1) The bounds polys of new-var with the polys of the found pot, and
; (2) the polys of new-var with the bounds polys of the found pot.

; All the deal-with-xxx functions return four values: a new step-limit, the
; standard contradictionp, a potentially augmented pot-lst (or nil if
; contradictionp is true), and the accumulated list of products we have already
; tried.

; New-vars is a list of pot labels or factors thereof.  We think of it
; as the labels of newly added pots, analogous to new-vars in
; add-polys-and-lemmas1.

; We cdr down the list of new-vars, calling the deal-with-xxx functions
; on the way.  The basic idea is that if a new var is a product and we have
; polys about both factors, then we can multiply those polys together to
; form polys about the new var.  We are thus using the lemma

; 0 < a & 0 < b -> 0 < a*b  (for rational a and b)

; We ``deal with'' new vars of the form a*b, a/b.  Analogously, if we
; have a new var of the form a we look to see whether we have an old
; pot about a*b and if so, look for a pot about b, etc.  That is, we try
; not to be sensitive to the order in which the pots a, b, and a*b are
; added.

; We do not handle terms like (* a (* a (* a a))) very well.  We
; anticipate that such terms will be normalized into expt expressions
; anyway.  So handling them here may not be too helpful.

; Unfortunately, we do not handle (expt a i) very well either.  We do
; know that (expt a -2) is the inverse of (expt a 2).  But we do not
; know that (expt a 2) is a*a or any of the analogous higher-order
; facts.  This is an obvious subject for future work.

; Note that we keep around the original pot-lst.  We have found this
; heuristic useful to prevent excessive effort on the part of
; non-linear arithmetic.  After running a large number of tests, we
; have found that the polys which we wished to multiply were almost
; always present in the original pot-lst and that much time can be
; saved this way.  Perhaps in a few more years when computers are even
; faster than they are now (2002) this should be revisited.

; Products-already-tried is an accumulator which keeps track of which pots
; we have already tried multiplying the polys from.

; by assuming the disjunction of the polys in lst1 and lst2.  But since
; pot lists can only represent conjunctions, we are forced to take a weak
; approach:  we can assume lst1 if the assumption of lst2 produces a
; contradiction and vice versa.  If both are contradictory, we return
; the standard contradiction result.  Otherwise we return a (possibly) new
; pot-lst.

; The hard part of this procedure is keeping track of dependencies.
; If lst1 is contradictory, we must infect lst2 with the ttree of the
; contradiction, since the assumption of lst2 is dependent upon the
; proof that lst1 is contradictory.  We must do the symmetric thing if
; lst2 proves to be contradictory.  But here we are in an efficiency
; bind.  We have already created the assumption of
; simplify-clause-pot-lst and lst1 and do not want to re-create it
; after infecting lst1 with the ttree from the refutation of lst2.  So
; we visit the modified pot-lst after the fact, if lst2 is contradictory,
; and add the appropriate ttree.

; Historical Note: In nqthm we handled this problem by infecting the
; polys of lst1 with a special mark (a fresh cons) in the lemmas field
; of the poly before we added them to the pot-lst.  If lst2 gave a
; contradiction, we scanned the pot-lst produced by lst1 looking for
; all polys containing that (eq) cons.  During the initial attempts to
; code linear applicatively we tried to mimic this by using a 'mark
; tag in the tag-tree and inventing a "new" mark, such as an integer
; that was associated with the simplify-clause-pot-lst and was
; increased here when we obtained the mark.  We could not find a
; convincing way to generate a new mark.  The problem is due to the
; recursive rewriting done to add :LINEAR lemmas.  How do we know a
; mark generated now will still be new when it needs to be?  How do we
; know that a term rewritten in an extension of this pot-lst under us,
; doesn't have some marks in its tag-tree that will come back to haunt
; us?  These questions may have cut and dried answers that make marks
; viable.  But we decided not to pursue them and just identify the new
; polys as done here.  This exercise does point to the convenience of
; being able to use cons to generate a unique object.

; the others.  But if one gives a contradiction, then we can go with the
; assumption of the other as the assumption of their disjunction.  There is a
; subtlety here however: the assumption of lst2 in place of (or lst1 lst2)
; depends upon the refutation of lst1 and hence we must infect the polys from
; lst2 with the ttree arising from the refutation of lst1.  And vice versa.
; See add-disjunct-polys-and-lemma.

; We return two values, the standard contradictionp, and a new pot-lst.

; The to-do-later list was first present in Version 1.6, and represents an
; attempt to make the order of the split-lst irrelevant.  The idea is that if a
; doublet in the split-lst must be "discarded" as noted above, then we actually
; save that doublet on to-do-later and try it again after processing the
; others.  Here is a long message that explains the problem; the message was
; sent to Bishop Brock, who first reported the problem, on March 31, 1994,

; I have fixed the "bug" that prevented us from proving

; (thm
;  (IMPLIES
;   (AND (INTEGERP N)
;        (NOT (< N 0))
;        (NOT (< 4 N))
;        (NOT (EQUAL N 2))
;        (NOT (EQUAL N 0))
;        (NOT (EQUAL N 1))
;        (NOT (EQUAL N 3)))
;   (EQUAL N 4)))

; To understand what I did, consider a proof that works, e.g.,
;  (IMPLIES (AND (INTEGERP N)
;              (NOT (< N 0))
;              (NOT (< 4 N))
;              (NOT (EQUAL N 0))
;              (NOT (EQUAL N 1))
;              (NOT (EQUAL N 2))
;              (NOT (EQUAL N 3)))
;         (EQUAL N 4))

; The arithmetic hyps are stored in the linear inequalities database by the
; linear arithmetic package.  That database represents a conjunction of
; inequalities.  The first two inequalities give us

;  0 <= N <= 4

; Now we come to the hard part.  In general, we cannot represent (NOT (EQUAL x
; y)) as a conjunction of inequalities.  It turns into a DISjunction, namely,
; either x < y or y < x.  Thus, if we are asked to add (NOT (EQUAL x y)) to the
; linear database we try adding x < y.  If that gives us a contradiction, then
; we know y < x and we add that.  Alternatively, if x < y doesn't give us a
; contradiction, but y < x does, we can assume x < y.  If neither gives us a
; contradiction, we simply can't represent (NOT (EQUAL x y)) in the linear
; database.  Note that to get any linear information out of (NOT (EQUAL x y))
; we must get a contradiction from one of the two disjuncts.

; When you process the hypotheses in the "wrong" order, you don't always get a
; contradiction and so we effectively drop one or more of the inequalities and
; lose.

; Consider one of the many "right" orders first, in particular the proof that
; works above.  The first NOT EQUAL we process is (NOT (EQUAL N 0)).  Because N
; is an integer, this is equivalent to either N <= -1 or 1 <= N.  The linear
; database we have initially is

;  0 <= N <= 4.

; When we add N <= -1 we get a contradiction, by clashing 0 <= N with N <= -1
; and deriving 0 <= -1.  Since we got a contradiction on one disjunct we can
; assume the other.  Adding 1 <= N to the above database gives us

;  1 <= N <= 4.

; Note that we are now in a position to successfully process (NOT (EQUAL N 1)),
; because it becomes either N <= 0 (contradiction) or 2 <= N, and thus we get

;  2 <= N <= 4.

; As you can see, we can keep narrowing the known interval as long as the hyp
; we process is beyond the current known endpoints.  We can work at either
; endpoint and so there are many "right" orders.  (In the case of the 5-way
; case split on N=0,1,2,3,4, there are 90 right orders and 30 wrong ones out of
; the 120 permutations.)

; Now consider one of the "wrong" orders.  If we know

;  0 <= N <= 4

; and we first process (NOT (EQUAL N 1)) then we must get a contradiction from
; either N <= 0 or from 2 <f= N.  But neither of these is contradictory yet.
; So in Version 1.5 (and Nqthm!) we just ignore that NOT EQUAL hyp (as far as
; linear arithmetic is concerned).  Once we've ignored any one hyp, the game is
; lost.

; In Version 1.6 the success of linear is independent of the order in which the
; inequalities are presented.  I do this by keeping a list of the ones I had
; tried to add but couldn't, i.e., the ones that Version 1.5 decided to ignore.
; Call that list the "to-do-later list".  I process all the hyps and get a
; database and a to-do-later list.  Then I reprocess the to-do-later list and
; see if any can be added now.  I iterate until either I've added them all or
; no changes happen.

; In the case of inequalities about variable symbols this is very very fast.
; In the case of inequalities about arbitrary terms, e.g., (NOT (EQUAL (FOO
; (BAR X Y)) 2)), it can be slow because every time we add an inequality we go
; look in the :LINEAR lemmas database for more facts about that term.  But I
; think this problem doesn't arise too often and I think we'll find Version 1.6
; better than Version 1.5 and seldom any slower.

; Thank you very much Bishop for noticing this problem.  It is amazing to me
; that it survived all those years in Nqthm without coming to our attention.

; If no contradiction is indicated then the second value is the new
; simplify-clause-pot-lst.  For each poly p in the new pot list there is a
; proof of p from type-alist, the assumption of the terms in term-lst (as per

; Historical Plaque from Nqthm:

;    We tried rewriting with linear under the objective ?, and it cost
;    us 4 million conses over a proveall, so we stopped rewriting with
;    linear under the objective ?.  We found that too restrictive, and
;    experimented with the idea of only rewriting with linear under ?
;    when ANCESTORS is nonNIL, i.e., when we are working on a term
;    that may appear as part of the simplification of the theorem as
;    opposed to a term that appears while rewriting the hypothesis of
;    a :REWRITE rule.  That cost us 5 times more conses on the theorem
;    it was designed to prove!  So we have abandoned linear under ?
;    altogether, again.  Here, however is the most recent experimental
;    code:

;    (COND ((AND (NULL ANCESTORS)
;                (EQ (ADD-TERM-TO-POT-LST TERM
;                                         SIMPLIFY-CLAUSE-POT-LST NIL NIL)

;           (SETQ ANS FALSE)
;           (GO WIN)))

; On a somewhat related note, we have briefly considered the possibility of
; supporting some weak kind of forward chaining when we enter the true and
; false branches of an IF, generalizing what we support with compound
; recognizer rules.

; (implies (unsigned-byte-p 4 x)
;          (< x 16))

; We have come up with at least the following reasons not to provide such
; support.

; - To take full advantage of such a rule we'd need assume-true-false to extend
;   the linear pot, which would likely be expensive, as discussed above.

; - IF calls generally work their way up to top-level case splits anyhow, with
;   two exceptions: backchaining and the tentative opening of recursive
;   functions.  Such a rule would only provide marginal help for these cases.
;   Note that recursive function calls can be forced open anyhow, using :expand
;   hints.
