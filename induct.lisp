(defun sound-induction-principle-mask (term formals quick-block-info subset)

; Term is a call of some fn on some args.  The formals and
; quick-block-info are those of fn, and subset is one of fn's measured
; subset (a subset of formals).  We wish to determine, in the
; terminology of ACL, whether the induction applies to term.  If so we
; return a mask indicating how to build the substitutions for the
; induction from args and the machine for fn.  Otherwise we return
; nil.

; Let the changeables be those args that are in measured formal
; positions that sometimes change in the recursion.  Let the
; unchangeables be all of the variables occurring in measured actuals
; that never change in recursion.  The induction applies if
; changeables is a sequence of distinct variable names and has an
; empty intersection with unchangeables.

; If the induction is applicable then the substitutions should
; substitute for the changeables just as the recursion would, and hold
; each unchangeable fixed -- i.e., substitute each for itself.  With
; such substitutions it is possible to prove the measure lemmas
; analogous to those proved when justification of subset was stored,
; except that the measure is obtained by instantiating the measure
; term used in the justification by the measured actuals in unchanging
; slots.  Actual variables that are neither among the changeables or
; unchangeables may be substituted for arbitrarily.

; If the induction is applicable we return a mask with as many
; elements as there are args.  For each arg the mask contains either
; 'changeable, 'unchangeable, or nil.  'Changeable means the arg
; should be instantiated as specified in the recursion.  'Unchangeable
; means each var in the actual should be held fixed.  Nil means that
; the corresponding substitution pairs in the machine for the function
; should be ignored.

; Abstractly, this function builds the mask by first putting either
; 'changeable or 'unchangeable in each measured slot.  It then fills
; in the remaining slots from the left so as to permit the actual to
; be instantiated or held fixed as desired by the recursion, provided
; that in so doing it does not permit substitutions for previously
; allocated actuals.

; This record is used to represent one of the plausible inductions that must be
; considered.  The SCORE represents some fairly artificial estimation of how
; many terms in the conjecture want this induction.  CONTROLLERS is the list of
; the controllers -- including unchanging controllers -- for all the inductions
; merged to form this one.  The CHANGED-VARS is a list of all those variables
; that will be instantiated (non-identically) in some induction hypotheses.
; Thus, CHANGED-VARS include both variables that actually contribute to why
; some measure goes down and variables like accumulators that are just along
; for the ride.  UNCHANGEABLE-VARS is a list of all those vars which may not be
; changed by any substitution if this induction is to be sound for the reasons
; specified.  TESTS-AND-ALISTS-LST is a list of TESTS-AND-ALISTS which
; indicates the case analysis for the induction and how the various induction
; hypotheses are obtained via substitutions.  JUSTIFICATION is the
; JUSTIFICATION that justifies this induction, and INDUCTION-TERM is the term
; that suggested this induction and from which you obtain the actuals to
; substitute into the template.  OTHER-TERMS are the induction-terms of
; candidates that have been merged into this one for heuristic reasons.

; Because of induction rules we can think of some terms being aliases for
; others.  We have to make a distinction between the terms in the conjecture
; that suggested an induction and the actual terms that suggested the
; induction.  For example, if an induction rule maps (fn x y) to (recur x y),
; then (recur x y) will be the INDUCTION-TERM because it suggested the
; induction and we will, perhaps, have to recover its induction machine or
; quick block information to implement various heuristics.  But we do not wish
; to report (recur x y) to the user, preferring instead to report (fn x y).
; Therefore, corresponding to INDUCTION-TERM and OTHER-TERMS we have
; XINDUCTION-TERM and XOTHER-TERMS, which are maintained in exactly the same
; way as their counterparts but which deal completely with the user-level view
; of the induction.  In practice this means that we will initialize the
; XINDUCTION-TERM field of a candidate with the term from the conjecture,
; initialize the INDUCTION-TERM with its alias, and then merge the fields
; completely independently but analogously.  XANCESTRY is a field maintained by
; merging to contain the user-level terms that caused us to change our
; tests-and-alists.  (Some candidates may be flushed or merged into this one
; without changing it.)

; The ttree of a candidate contains 'LEMMA tags listing the :induction rules
; (if any) involved in the suggestion of the candidate.

; and hence we pass symbols and define our own special-purpose "apply"
; that interprets the particular symbols passed to calls of
; pigeon-holep.

; However, it turns out that the applications of pigeon-holep require
; passing functions that themselves call pigeon-holep.  And so
; pigeon-holep-apply is mutually recursive with pigeon-holep (but only
; because the application functions use pigeon-holep).

; Lst1 and lst2 are each tests-and-alists-lsts from some induction
; candidates.  Intuitively, we try to stuff the alists of lst1 into
; those of lst2 to construct a new lst2 that combines the induction
; schemes of both.  If we fail we return nil.  Otherwise we return the
; modified lst2.  The modified lst2 has exactly the same tests as
; before; only its alists are different and they are different only by
; virtue of having been extended with some addition pairs.  So the
; justification of the merged induction is the same as the
; justification of the original lst2.

; Given an alist1 from lst1, which alist2's of lst2 do you extend and
; how?  Suppose alist1 maps x to x' and y to y'.  Then intuitively we
; think "the first candidate is trying to keep x and y in step, so
; that when x goes to x' y goes to y'."  So, if you see an alist in
; lst2 that is replacing x by x', one might be tempted to augment it
; by replacing y by y'.  However, what if x is just an accumulator?
; The role of vars is to specify upon which variables two
; substitutions must agree in order to be merged.  Usually, vars
; consists of the measured variables.

; So now we get a little more technical.  We will try to "merge" each
; alist1 from lst1 into each alist2 from lst2 (preserving the case structure
; of lst2).  If alist1 and alist2 do not agree on vars then their merge
; is just alist2.  If they do agree on vars, then their merge is their
; union, provided that is a substitution.  It may fail to be a substitution
; because the two alists disagree on some other variable.  In that case
; we say the two are irreconcilable.  We now give three simple examples:

; Let vars be {x}.  Let alist2 be {(x . x') (z . z')}.  If alist1 maps
; x to x'', then their merge is just alist2 because alist1 is
; addressing a different case of the induction.  If alist1 maps x to x'
; and y to y', then their merge is {(x . x') (y . y') (z . z')}.  If
; alist1 maps x to x' and z to z'', then the two are irreconcilable.
; Two irreconcilable alists that agree on vars are called "antagonists"
; because they "want" to merge but can't.  We cannot merge lst1 into lst2
; if they have an antagonistic pair between them.  If an antagonistic pair
; is discovered, the entire merge operation fails.

; Now we will successively consider each alist1 in lst1 and merge it
; into lst2, forming successive lst2's.  We insist that each alist1 of
; lst1 have at least one mate in lst2 with which it agrees and is
; reconcilable.  (Otherwise, we could merge completely disjoint
; substitutions.)

; Because we try the alist1's successively, each alist1 is actually
; merged into the lst2 produced by all the previous alist1's.  That
; produces an apparent order dependence.  However, this is avoided by
; the requirement that we never produce antagonistic pairs.

; For example, suppose that in one case of lst1, x is mapped to x' and
; y is mapped to y', but in another case x is mapped to x' and y is
; mapped to y''.  Now imagine trying to merge that lst1 into a lst2 in
; which x is mapped to x' and z is mapped to z'.  The first alist of
; lst1 extends lst2 to (((x . x') (y . y') (z . z'))).  But the second
; alist is then antagonistic.  The same thing happens if we tried the two
; alists of lst1 in the other order.  Thus, the above lst1 cannot be merged
; into lst2.  Note that they can be merged in the other order!  That is,
; lst2 can be merged into lst1, because the case structure of lst1 is
; richer.

; We can detect the situation above without forming the intermediate
; lst2.  In particular, if lst1 contains an antagonistic pair, then it
; cannot be merged with any lst2 and we can quit.

; Note: Once upon a time, indeed, for the first 20 years or so of the
; existence of the merge routine, we took the attitude that if
; irreconcilable but agreeable alists arose, then we just added to
; alist2 those pairs of alist1 that were reconcilable and we left out
; the irreconcilable pairs.  This however resulted in the system often
; merging complicated accumulator using functions (like TAUTOLOGYP)
; into simpler functions (like NORMALIZEDP) by dropping the
; accumulators that got in the way.  This idea of just not doing
; "hostile merges" is being tried out for the first time in ACL2.

(defun compute-vetoes (cand-lst wrld)

; We try two different techniques for throwing out candidates.  If the
; first throws out everything, we try the second.  If the second throws
; out everything, we throw out nothing.

; The two are: (1) throw out a candidate if its changing induct-vars
; (the variables in control slots that change) intersect with either
; the changed-vars or the unchangeable-vars of another candidate.  (2)
; throw out a candidate if its changed-vars intersect the
; unchangeable-vars of another candidate.

; Historical Plaque from Nqthm:

;   This function weeds out "unclean" induction candidates.  The
;   intuition behind the notion "clean" is that an induction is clean
;   if nobody is competing with it for instantiation of its variables.
;   What we actually do is throw out any candidate whose changing
;   induction variables -- that is the induction variables as computed
;   by induct-vars intersected with the changed vars of candidate --
;   intersect the changed or unchanged variables of another candidate.
;   The reason we do not care about the first candidates unchanging
;   vars is as follows.  The reason you want a candidate clean is so
;   that the terms riding on that cand will reoccur in both the
;   hypothesis and conclusion of an induction.  There are two ways to
;   assure (or at least make likely) this: change the variables in the
;   terms as specified or leave them constant.  Thus, if the first
;   cand's changing vars are clean but its unchanging vars intersect
;   another cand it means that the first cand is keeping those other
;   terms constant, which is fine. (Note that the first cand would be
;   clean here.  The second might be clean or dirty depending on
;   whether its changed vars or unchanged vars intersected the first
;   cand's vars.)  The reason we check only the induction vars and not
;   all of the changed vars is if cand1's changed vars include some
;   induction vars and some accumulators and the accumulators are
;   claimed by another cand2 we believe that cand1 is still clean.
;   The motivating example was

;   (IMPLIES (MEMBER A C) (MEMBER A (UNION1 B C)))

;   where the induction on C is dirty because the induction on B and C
;   claims C, but the induction on B and C is clean because the B does
;   not occur in the C induction.  We do not even bother to check the
;   C from the (B C) induction because since it is necessarily an
;   accumulator it is probably being constructed and thus, if it
;   occurs in somebody else's ind vars it is probably being eaten so
;   it will be ok.  In formulating this heuristic we did not consider
;   the possibility that the accums of one candidate occur as
;   constants in the other.  Oh well.

;   July 20, 1978.  We have added an additional heuristic, to be
;   applied if the above one eliminates all cands.  We consider a cand
;   flawed if it changes anyone else's constants.  The motivating
;   example was GREATEST-FACTOR-LESSP -- which was previously proved
;   only by virtue of a very ugly use of the no-op fn ID to make a
;   certain induction flawed.

(defun m&m (bag fn)

; This function takes a bag and a symbol naming a dyadic function, fn,
; known to m&m-apply and about which we assume certain properties
; described below.  Let z be (m&m-apply fn x y).  Then we say x and y
; "mate" if z is non-nil.  If x and y mate, we say z is the "merge" of
; x and y.  The name of this function abbreviates the phrase "mate and
; merge".

; We consider each element, x, of bag in turn and seek the first
; successive element, y, that mates with it.  If we find one, we throw
; out both, add their merge in place of x and iterate.  If we find no
; mate for x, we deposit it in our answer accumulator.

; The specification above is explicit about the order in which we try
; the elements of the bag.  If we try to loosen the specification so
; that order is unimportant, we must require that fn have certain
; properties.  We discuss this below.

; First, note that we have implicitly assumed that mate and merge are
; commutative because we haven't said in which order we present the
; arguments.

; Second, note that if x doesn't mate with any y, we set it aside in
; our accumulating answer.  We do not even try to mate such an x with
; the offspring of the y's it didn't like.  This makes us order
; dependent.  For example, consider the bag {x y1 y2}.  Suppose x
; won't mate with either y1 or y2, but that y1 mates with y2 to
; produce y3 and x mates with y3 to produce y4.  Then if we seek mates
; for x first we find none and it gets into our final answer.  Then y1
; and y2 mate to form y3.  The final answer is hence {x y3}.  But if
; we seek mates for y1 first we find y2, produce y3, add it to the
; bag, forming {y3 x}, and then mate x with y3 to get the final answer
; {y4}.  This order dependency cannot arise if fn has the property
; that if x mates with the merge of y and z then x mates with either y
; or z.  This is called the "distributive" property of mate over merge.

; Third, note that if x does mate with y to produce z then we throw x
; out in favor of z.  Thus, x is not mated against any but the first
; y.  Thus, if we have {x y1 y2} and x mates with y1 to form z1 and x
; mates with y2 to form z2 and there are no other mates, then we can
; either get {z1 y2} or {z2 y1} as the final bag, depending on whether
; we mate x with y1 or y2.  This order dependency cannot arise if fn
; has the property that if x mates with y1 and x mates with y2, then
; (a) the merge of x and y1 mates with y2, and (b) merge has the
; "commutativity-2" (merge (merge x y1) y2) = (merge (merge x y2) y1).
; We call property (a) "non-preclusion" property of mate and merge,
; i.e., merging doesn't preclude mating.

; The commutativity-2 property is implied by associativity and (the
; already assumed commutativity).  Thus, another way to avoid the
; third order dependency is if legal merges are associative and have
; the non-preclusion property.

; Important Note: The commonly used fn of unioning together two alists
; that agree on the intersection of their domains, does not have the
; non-preclusion property!  Suppose x, y1, and y2 are all alists and
; all map A to 0.  Suppose in addition y1 maps B to 1 but y2 maps B to
; 2.  Finally, suppose x maps C to 3.  Then x mates with both y1 and
; y2.  But merging y1 into x precludes mating with y2 and vice versa.

; We claim, but do not prove, that if the mate and merge functions for
; fn are commutative and associative, and have the distributive and
; non-preclusion properties, then m&m is order independent.

; For efficiency we have chosen to implement deletion by keeping a
; list of the deleted elements.  But we cannot make a list of the
; deleted elements themselves because there may be duplicate elements
; in the bag and we need to be able to delete occurrences.  Thus, the
; workhorse function actually operates on a list of pairs, (i . ele),
; where i is a unique identification integer and ele is an element of
; the bag.  In fact we just assign the position of each occurrence to
; each element of the initial bag and thereafter count up as we
; generate new elements.

(defun m&m-over-powerset (st fn)

; Fn is a function known to m&m-apply.  Let (fn* s) be defined to be z,
; if (m&m s fn) = {z} and nil otherwise.  Informally, (fn* s) is the
; result of somehow mating and merging all the elements of s into a single
; object, or nil if you can't.

; This function applies fn* to the powerset of st and collects all those
; non-nil values produced from maximal s's.  I.e., we keep (fn* s) iff it
; is non-nil and no superset of s produces a non-nil value.

; We do this amazing feat (recall that the powerset of a set of n
; things contains 2**n subsets) by generating the powerset in order
; from largest to smallest subsets and don't generate or test any
; subset under a non-nil fn*.  Nevertheless, if the size of set is
; very big, this function will get you.

; An informal specification of this function is that it is like m&m
; except that we permit an element to be merged into more than one
; other element (but an element can be used at most once per final
; element) and we try to maximize the amount of merging we can do.

; For example, if x mates with y1 to form z1, and x mates with y2 to
; form z2, and no other mates occur, then this function would
; transform {x y1 y2} into {z1 z2}.  It searches by generate and test:

;       s            (fn* s)
;    (x y1 y2)         nil
;    (x y1)            z1
;    (x y2)            z2
;    (x)              subsumed
;    (y1 y2)           nil
;    (y1)             subsumed
;    (y2)             subsumed
;    nil              subsumed

; Here, s1 is "subsumed" by s2 means s1 is a subset of s2.  (Just the
; opposite technical definition but exactly the same meaning as in the
; clausal sense.)

; The way we generate the powerset elements is suggested by the
; following trivial von Neumann function, ps, which, when called as in
; (ps set nil), calls PROCESS on each member of the powerset of set,
; in the order in which we generate them:

; (defun ps (set subset)
;  (cond ((null set) (PROCESS subset))
;        (t (ps (cdr set) (cons (car set) subset))   ;rhs
;           (ps (cdr set) subset))))                 ;lhs

; By generating larger subsets first we know that if a subset subsumes
; the set we are considering then that subset has already been
; considered.  Therefore, we need a way to keep track of the subsets
; with non-nil values.  We do this with a "subset tree".  Let U be the
; universe of objects in some order.  Then the full binary tree with
; depth |U| can be thought of as the powerset of U.  In particular,
; any branch through the tree, from top-most node to tip, represents a
; subset of U by labelling the nodes at successive depth by the
; successive elements of U (the topmost node being labelled with the
; first element of U) and adopting the convention that taking a
; right-hand (cdr) branch at a node indicates that the label is in the
; subset and a left-hand (car) branch indicates that the label is not
; in the subset.  At the tip of the tree we store a T indicating that
; the subset had a non-nil value or a NIL indicating that it had a nil
; value.

; For storage efficiency we let nil represent an arbitrarily deep full
; binary tree will nil at every tip and we let t represent the
; analogous trees with t at every tip.  Car-subset-tree,
; cdr-subset-tree and cons-subset-tree implement these abstractions.

; Of course, we don't have the tree when we start and we generate it
; as we go.  That is a really weird idea because generating the tree
; that tells us who was a subset of whom in the past seems to have little
; use as we move forward.  But that is not true.

; Observe that there is a correspondence between these trees and the
; function ps above for generating the power set.  The recursion
; labelled "rhs" above is going down the right-hand side of the tree
; and the "lhs" recursion is going down the left-hand side.  Note that
; we go down the rhs first.

; The neat fact about these trees is that there is a close
; relationship between the right-hand subtree (rhs) and left-hand
; subtree (lhs) of any given node of the tree: lhs can be obtained
; from rhs by turning some nils into ts.  The reason is that the tips
; of the lhs of a node labelled by x denote exactly the same subsets
; as the corresponding tips of the right-hand side, except that on the
; right x was present in the subset and on the left it is not.  So
; when we do the right hand side we come back with a tree and if we
; used that very tree for the left hand side (interpreting nil as
; meaning "compute it and see" and t as meaning "a superset of this
; set has non-nil value") then it is correct.  But we can do a little
; better than that because we might have come into this node with a
; tree (i.e., one to go into the right hand side with and another to go
; into the left hand side with) and so after we have gone into the
; right and come back with its new tree, we can disjoin the output of
; the right side with the input for the left side to form the tree we
; will actually use to explore the left side.

; Cl-set is a set of clauses we are to try to prove by induction, applying

; Historical Plaque from Nqthm:

;   TESTS-AND-ALISTS-LST is a such a list that the disjunction of the
;   conjunctions of the TESTS components of the members is T.  Furthermore,
;   there exists a measure M, a well-founded relation R, and a sequence of
;   variables x1, ..., xn such that for each T&Ai in TESTS-AND-ALISTS-LST, for
;   each alist alst in the ALISTS component of T&Ai, the conjunction of the
;   TESTS component, say qi, implies that (R (M x1 ... xn)/alst (M x1 ... xn)).

;   To prove thm, the conjunction of the disjunctions of the members of CL-SET,
;   it is sufficient, by the principle of induction, to prove instead the
;   conjunction of the terms qi & thm' & thm'' ...  -> thm, where the primed
;   terms are the results of substituting the alists in the ALISTS field of the
;   ith member of TESTS-AND-ALISTS-LST into thm.

;   If thm1, thm2, ..., thmn are the disjunctions of the members of CL-SET,
;   then it is sufficient to prove all of the formulas qi & thm' & thm'' ...
;   -> thmj.  This is a trivial proposition fact, to prove (IMPLIES A (AND B
;   C)) it is sufficient to prove (IMPLIES A B) and (IMPLIES A C).

;   The (ITERATE FOR PICK ...)* expression below returns a list of
;   clauses whose conjunction propositionally implies qi & thm' &
;   thm'' ...  -> thmj, where TA is the ith member of
;   TESTS-AND-ALISTS-LST and CL is the jth member of CL-SET.  Proof:
;   Let THM have the form:
;
;        (AND (OR a1 ...)
;             (OR b1 ...)
;             ...
;             (OR z1 ...)).

;   Then qi & thm' & thm'' ... -> thmj has the form:

;       (IMPLIES (AND qi
;                     (AND (OR a1 ... )
;                          (OR b1 ... )

;                          (OR z1 ... ))'

;                          (OR b1 ... )
;                          ...
;                          (OR z1 ... ))''
;                     ...
;                     (AND (OR a1 ... )
;                          (OR b1 ... )

;                          (OR z1 ... )))'''...'
;                thmj).
;
;   Suppose this formula is false for some values of the free variables.  Then
;   under those values, each disjunction in the hypothesis is true.  Thus there
;   exists a way of choosing one literal from each of the disjunctions, all of
;   which are true.  This choice is one of the PICKs below.  But we prove that

; Historical Plaque from Nqthm:

;   Two of the variables effecting REWRITE are TERMS-TO-BE-IGNORED-BY-REWRITE
;   and EXPAND-LST.  When any term on the former is encountered REWRITE returns
;   it without rewriting it.  Terms on the latter must be calls of defined fns
;   and when encountered are replaced by the rewritten body.

;   We believe that the theorem prover will perform significantly faster on
;   many theorems if, after an induction, it does not waste time (a) trying to
;   simplify the recursive calls introduced in the induction hypotheses and (b)
;   trying to decide whether to expand the terms inducted for in the induction
;   conclusion.  This suspicion is due to some testing done with the idea of
;   "homographication" which was just a jokingly suggested name for the idea of
;   generalizing the recursive calls away at INDUCT time after expanding the
;   induction terms in the conclusion.  Homographication speeded the
;   theorem-prover on many theorems but lost on several others because of the
;   premature generalization.  See the comment in FORM-INDUCTION-CLAUSE.

;   To avoid the generalization at INDUCT time we are going to try using
;   TERMS-TO-BE-IGNORED-BY-REWRITE.  The idea is this, during the initial
;   simplification of a clause produced by INDUCT we will have the recursive
;   terms on TERMS-TO-BE-IGNORED-BY-REWRITE.  When the clause settles down --
;   hopefully it will often be proved first -- we will restore
;   TERMS-TO-BE-IGNORED-BY-REWRITE to its pre-INDUCT value.  Note however that
;   we have to mess with TERMS-TO-BE-IGNORED-BY-REWRITE on a clause by clause
;   basis, not just once in INDUCT.

;   So here is the plan.  INDUCT will set INDUCTION-HYP-TERMS to the list of
;   instances of the induction terms, and will set INDUCTION-CONCL-TERMS to the
;   induction terms themselves.  SIMPLIFY-CLAUSE will look at the history of
;   the clause to determine whether it has settled down since induction.  If
;   not it will bind TERMS-TO-BE-IGNORED-BY-REWRITE to the concatenation of
;   INDUCTION-HYP-TERMS and its old value and will analogously bind EXPAND-LST.
;   A new process, called SETTLED-DOWN-SENT, will be used to mark when in the
;   history the clause settled down.

; In a departure from Nqthm, starting with Version_2.8, we do not wait for
; settled-down before turning off the above special consideration given to
; induction-hyp-terms and induction-concl-terms. See simplify-clause for
