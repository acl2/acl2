#  NOTE:  Users need not read below this line.  Neither should installers of
#  ACL2 at sites other than CLI.  We have no reason to believe that the make
#  commands illustrated below will work at sites other than CLI.  Indeed, we
#  have reasons to believe they will not!  A typical problem is that we refer
#  to a file or directory that exists at CLI but that is not created when our
#  installation instructions are followed at other sites.

#  Example invocations for CLI implementors:

#   NOTE:  Make large completely recompiles, initializes and
#   saves.

#   make full      ; A complete recompilation whether needed or not.
#   make full init ; Completely recompile, initialize and save.
#   make full-meter init  ; Completely recompile with meters, init and save.
#   make init      ; Just build full-size ${PREFIXsaved_acl2}.
#   make check-sum ; Call only after ACL2 is completely compiled.
#   make full LISP=lucid PREFIX=lucid-  ; makes acl2 in Lucid
#   make full LISP=cl PREFIX=allegro- ; makes acl2 in allegro
#                  ; Note:  Allegro is not always named cl at CLI.  See
#                  ; ~moore/allegro/runcl for some clues.
#   make full LISP=lispworks PREFIX=lispworks- ; makes acl2 in lispworks
#   make copy-distribution DIR=/stage/ftp/pub/moore/acl2/v2-9/acl2-sources
#                  ; copies all of acl2 plus books, doc, etc., to the named
#                  ; directory, as for compiling on another architecture or
#                  ; moving to the ftp site.
#                  ; Preconditions:
#                  ; (1) The named directory must not already exist; if it
#                  ;     does, a harmless error is caused.
#                  ; (2) acl2-book must be gzipped, i.e., if necessary first do
#                         gzip /projects/acl2/v2-9/doc/TEX/acl2-book.ps
#                         gzip /projects/acl2/v2-9/doc/TEX/acl2-book.dvi
#   make DOC       ; Build xdoc manual and rebuild source file doc.lisp
#   make clean-doc ; Remove files created by make DOC
#   make proofs    ; Assuming sources are compiled, initialize without skipping
#                  ; proofs during pass 2.  Does not save an image.  Uses same
#                  ; flags used to build full-size image.

#  Metering: If the currently compiled version is unmetered and you
#  wish it metered, the fastest thing to do is to (push :acl2-metering
#  *features*) and then yank in and recompile just those definitions
#  that mention acl2-metering.  However, if you would like to install
#  metering as part of a system-wide recompilation, use the full-meter
#  option below.  If you want to get rid of the metering in the
#  compiled code, do make full.

# Avoid escape characters in regression log:
export CERT_PL_NO_COLOR ?= t

# Always make it possible to gather timing statistics after a regression.

# The variable ACL2_REAL should be defined for the non-standard

# saved_acl2.  Variables ACL2_PAR, ACL2_DEVEL, and ACL2_WAG (for
# feature write-arithmetic-goals) are similar (with suffixes p, d, and
# w, resp., rather than r), but for versions that respectively are
# parallel or (for implementors only) have features :acl2-devel or
# :write-arithmetic-goals, for special builds pertaining to
# guard-verified functions or writing out arithmetic lemma data to
# ~/write-arithmetic-goals.lisp.  Variable ACL2_HONS is h by default,
# but when its value is the empty string, then suffix "c" is
# generated, to create an ACL2(c) build -- BUT NOTE that after
# Version_7.1, change ACL2-HONS at your own risk -- it might work, but
# we no longer claim to support it!
