#   make init      ; Just build full-size ${PREFIXsaved_acl2}.
#   make check-sum ; Call only after ACL2 is completely compiled.
#   make full LISP=lucid PREFIX=lucid-  ; makes acl2 in Lucid
#   make full LISP=cl PREFIX=allegro- ; makes acl2 in allegro
#   make full LISP=lispworks PREFIX=lispworks- ; makes acl2 in lispworks
#   make copy-distribution DIR=/stage/ftp/pub/moore/acl2/v2-9/acl2-sources
#                  ; copies all of acl2 plus books, doc, etc., to the named

#                  ;     The named directory must not already exist; if it
#                  ;     does, a harmless error is caused.
#   make DOC       ; Build xdoc manual and rebuild source file doc.lisp
#   make clean-doc ; Remove files created by make DOC
#   make proofs    ; Assuming sources are compiled, initialize without skipping

#                  ; flags used to build full-size image.

#  Metering: If the currently compiled version is unmetered and you
#  wish it metered, the fastest thing to do is to (push :acl2-metering
#  *features*) and then yank in and recompile just those definitions
#  that mention acl2-metering.  However, if you would like to install
#  metering as part of a system-wide recompilation, use the full-meter
#  option below.  If you want to get rid of the metering in the
#  compiled code, do make full.
