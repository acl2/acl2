# ACL2s Systems Programming Framework

The ACL2s systems programming framework (ASPF) is a library for
querying the ACL2 theorem prover from inside of "raw Lisp", a Common
Lisp process that has ACL2 loaded.

The library is inside of the `interface` subdirectory; see README.md
there for more information.
