    ;;  ~c[:SOME], or ~c[:NONE], and ~c[cpn] is ~c[t] or ~c[nil].

    ;;  Each level of the hierarchy describes techniques used to prove
    ;;  termination. Termination proofs performed after admitting this event will
    ;;  use the specified techniques in the order in which they are listed.

    ;;  Basically, the CCG analysis as described and illustrated at a high level
    ;;  in the documentation for ~il[CCG] can potentially be very expensive. In
    ;;  order to make the analysis as efficient as possible, we use less expensive
    ;;  (and less powerful) techniques first, and resort to more powerful and
    ;;  expensive techniques only when these fail.

    ;;  There are three ways of varying the CCG analysis, which are represented by
    ;;  each of the three elements in a hierarchy level (levels of the form
    ;;  ~c[(:measure pt)] will be explained later).

    ;;  ~c[Pt] tells the CCG analysis how to limit proof attempts. The idea behind
    ;;  this is that ACL2 is designed to prove statements that the user thinks are
    ;;  true. It therefore does everything it can to prove the conjecture. As ACL2
    ;;  useres already know, this can lead to very long, or even non-terminating
    ;;  proof attempts. The CCG analysis, on the other hand, sends multiple
    ;;  queries to the theorem prover that may or may not be true, in order to
    ;;  improve the accuracy of the analysis. It is therefore necessary to reign
    ;;  in ACL2's proof attempts to keep them from taking too long. Of course, the
    ;;  trade-off is that, the more we limit ACL2's prover, the less powerful it
    ;;  becomes.

    ;;  ~c[Pt] can be ~c[:built-in-clauses], which tells ACL2 to use only
    ;;  ~il[built-in-clauses] analysis. This is a very fast, and surprisingly
    ;;  powerful proof technique. For example, the definition of Ackermann's
    ;;  function given in the documentation for ~il[CCG] is solved using only this
    ;;  proof technique.

    ;;  ~c[Pt] can also be of the form ~c[(:induction-depth n)], where ~c[n] is a
    ;;  natural number. This uses the full theorem prover, but limits it in two
    ;;  ways. First, it stops proof attempts if ACL2 has been working on a subgoal
    ;;  with no case splitting or induction for 20 steps (that is, at a goal of
    ;;  the form 1.5'20'). It also limits the ~em[induction depth], which
    ;;  describes how many times we allow induction goals to lead to further
    ;;  induction goals. For example, ~c[(:induction-depth 0)] allows no
    ;;  induction, while ~c[(:induction-depth 1)] allows goals of the form ~c[*1]
    ;;  or ~c[*2], but stops if it creates a goal such as ~c[*1.1] or ~c[*2.1].

    ;;  ~c[Ccm-cs] limits which CCMs are compared using the theorem
    ;;  prover. Consider again the ~c[ack] example in the documentation for
    ;;  ~il[CCG]. All we needed was to compare the value of ~c[(acl2-count x)]
    ;;  before and after the recursive call and the value of ~c[(acl2-count y)]
    ;;  before and after the recursive call. We would learn nothing, and waste
    ;;  time with the theorem prover if we compared ~c[(acl2-count x)] to
    ;;  ~c[(acl2-count y)]. However, other times, it is important to compare CCMs
    ;;  with each other, for example, when arguments are permuted, or we are
    ;;  dealing with a mutual recursion.

    ;;  ~c[Ccm-cs] can be one of ~c[:EQUAL], ~c[:ALL], ~c[:SOME], or
    ;;  ~c[:NONE]. These limit which CCMs we compare based on the variables they
    ;;  mention. Let ~c[c] be a recursive call in the body of function ~c[f] that
    ;;  calls function ~c[g]. Let ~c[m1] be a CCM for ~c[f] and ~c[m2] be a CCM
    ;;  for ~c[g]. Let ~c[v1] be the formals mentioned in ~c[m1] and ~c[v2] be the
    ;;  formals mentioned in ~c[m2'] where ~c[m2'] is derived from ~c[m2] by
    ;;  substituting the formals of ~c[g] with the actuals of ~c[c]. For example,
    ;;  consider following function:
    ;;  ~bv[]
    ;;  (defun f (x)
    ;;    (if (endp x)
    ;;        0
    ;;      (1+ (f (cdr x)))))
    ;;  ~ev[]
    ;;  Now consider the case where ~c[m1] and ~c[m2] are both the measure
    ;;  ~c[(acl2-count x)]. Then if we look at the recursive call ~c[(f (cdr x))]
    ;;  in the body of ~c[f], then ~c[m2'] is the result of replacing ~c[x] with
    ;;  ~c[(cdr x)] in ~c[m2], i.e., ~c[(acl2-count (cdr x))].

    ;;  If ~c[ccm-cs] is ~c[:EQUAL] we will compare ~c[m1] to
    ;;  ~c[m2] if ~c[v1] and ~c[v2] are equal. If ~c[value] is ~c[:ALL] we will
    ;;  compare ~c[m1] to ~c[m2'] if ~c[v2] is a subset of ~c[v1]. If ~c[value] is
    ;;  ~c[:SOME] we will compare ~c[m1] to ~c[m2'] if ~c[v1] and ~c[v2]
    ;;  intersect. If ~c[value] is ~c[:NONE] we will compare ~c[m1] to ~c[m2] no
    ;;  matter what.

    ;;  There is one caveat to what was just said: if ~c[m1] and ~c[m2] are
    ;;  syntactically equal, then regardless of the value of ~c[ccm-cs] we will
    ;;  construct a CCMF that will indicate that ~c[(o>= m1 m2)].


    ;;  ~c[Cpn] tells us how much ruler information we will use to compare CCMs.
    ;;  Unlike ACL2's measure-based termination analysis, CCG has the ability to
    ;;  use the rulers from both the current recursive call the next recursive
    ;;  call when constructing the CCMFs. That is, instead of asking ``What
    ;;  happens when I make recursive call A?'', we can ask, ``What happens when
    ;;  execution moves from recursive call A to recursive call B?''. Using this
    ;;  information potentially strengthens the termination analysis. For a brief
    ;;  example, consider the following code:
    ;;  ~bv[]
    ;;  (defun half (x)
    ;;     (if (zp x)
    ;;         0
    ;;       (1+ (half (- x 2)))))
    ;;  ~ev[]

    ;;  Clearly this is terminating. If we choose a measure of ~c[(nfix x)] we
    ;;  know that if ~c[x] is a positive integer, ~c[(nfix (- x 2))] is less than
    ;;  ~c[(nfix x)]. But consider the measure ~c[(acl2-count x)]. The strange
    ;;  thing here is that if ~c[x] is 1, then ~c[(acl2-count (- x 2))] is
    ;;  ~c[(acl2-count -1)], which is 1, i.e. the ~c[acl2-count] of ~c[x]. So, the
    ;;  fact that we know that ~c[x] is a positive integer is not enough to show
    ;;  that this measure decreases. But notice that if ~c[x] is 1, we will recur
    ;;  just one more time. So, if we consider what happens when we move from the
    ;;  recursive call back to itself. In this case we know
    ;; ~c[(and (not (zp x)) (not (zp (- x 2))))].
    ;;  Under these conditions, it is trivial for ACL2 to prove that
    ;;  ~c[(acl2-count (- x 2))] is always less than ~c[(acl2-count x)].

    ;;  However, this can make the CCG analysis much more expensive, since
    ;;  information about how values change from step to step are done on a
    ;;  per-edge, rather than a per-node basis in the CCG (where the nodes are the
    ;;  recursive calls and the edges indicate that execution can move from one
    ;;  call to another in one step). Thus, calculating CCMFs (how values change
    ;;  across recursive calls) on a per-edge basis rather than a per-node basis
    ;;  can require n^2 instead of n prover queries.

    ;;  If ~c[cpn] is ~c[t], we will use only the ruler of the current recursive
    ;;  call to compute our CCMFs. If it is ~c[nil], we will use the much more
    ;;  expensive technique of using the rulers of the current and next call.

    ;;  Levels of the hierarchy of the form ~c[(:measure pt)] specify that the CCG
    ;;  analysis is to be set aside for a step, and the traditional measure-based
    ;;  termination proof is to be attempted. Here, ~c[pt] has the same meaning as
    ;;  it does in a CCG hierarchy level. That is, it limits the measure proof in
    ;;  order to avoid prohibitively long termination analyses.

    ;;  The user may specify their own hierarchy in the form given above. The main
    ;;  restriction is that no level may be subsumed by an earlier level. That is,
    ;;  it should be the case at each level of the hierarchy, that it is possible
    ;;  to discover new information about the CCG that could help lead to a
    ;;  termination proof.

    ;;  In addition to constructing his or her own CCG hierarchy, the user may use
    ;;  several preset hierarchies:

; (mv nil state) if event IO is inhibited.  But there are fixnum declarations

;;; The following code implements memoization. Currently this works as
;;; follows. At the beginning of termination analysis, we create a
;;; memoization struct with the default values for each list. At each
;;; prover query that is not built-in-clauses only, we check the prove
;;; list to see if any previously proved query subsumes our current
;;; goal. If so, we know our goal is true. Otherwise, we check our
;;; current goal against those previously unproven using 1 induction
;;; and, if our current restrictions indicate that we should only use
;;; 0 inductions, those previously unproven using 0 inductions. Here
;;; we check for equality (modulo alpha renaming) rather than
;;; subsumption, due to the fact that ACL2 is not a decision
;;; procedure, but relies on heuristics to guide proofs. Hence, ACL2
;;; might fail to prove a given theorem but succeed in proving a more
;;; general version.  Therefore, unless we find the same query (modulo
;;; alpha renaming) in our unproved lists, we try the proof anyway.
;;;
;;; When a ACL2 is done with a query, we add it to proved, unproved0,
;;; or unproved1 depending on whether the proof attempt was successful
;;; (and if it was not successful, how many inductions were tried).
;;;
;;; Possible improvements:
;;;
;;; * instead of proving queries on the fly, perhaps we could collect
;;;   all the queries and sort them from most to least general. That
;;;   way, if we prove a query, we get for free all the queries that
;;;   it generalizes.
;;;
;;; * can we do some preprocessing on the queries before we compare
;;;   them for subsumption? The current subsumption checks are simple
;;;   syntactic comparisons.
;;;
;;; * we can use random testing to discover queries that are provably
;;;   false. We can then have another list, false-queries that we can
;;;   check against. When doing so, we can safely check subsumption
;;;   rather than equality, making it much more powerful than the
;;;   current unproved checks.

----------------------------

Pete:: I am puzzled by the code below and I'm making a change
even though I don't have time to really understand it. Here's the
issue. If I define a function like this:

(defun gen-int-range (x y)
  (cond ((and (integerp x) (integerp y))
         (if (<= x y)
           (cons x (gen-int-range (1+ x) y))
           nil))
        (t nil)))

Then the ccg proof goes through and ccg guesses the ccm I expect,
namely y-x+1.

But, if I switch the order of the variables and I define the
function like this:

(defun gen-int-range ( y x)
  (cond ((and (integerp x) (integerp y))
         (if (<= y x)
           (cons y (gen-int-range (1+ y) x))
           nil))
        (t nil)))

Now ccg fails! and it is because it should have guessed the ccm
x-y+1, but instead it guessed y-x+1. Now, looking at the code
below, notice the how p is defined in the let*. That definition
essentially orders the args based on the term order, so we lose
the information about how they were compared. This is not a good
idea. In many cases, it might be fine because acl2-count is
robust, eg, acl2-count -10 = 10, but in this case the ccm we
guess does not decrease and cgen finds a counterexample. So, I
don't understand why the term order is used here at all. I
rewrote just this case in my updated version of ccg, below.

Also, the comment doesn't correspond with what the code actually
does. For example, the (< e1 e2) case generates the measure
e2-e1+1.

(defun-raw ccg-add-<-ccm (r formals ccms)

;    docs      - their documentation strings
;    pairs     - the (section-symbol . citations) pairs parsed from docs
;    guards    - their translated guards
;    measures  - their translated measure terms
;    ruler-extenders-lst
;              - their ruler-extenders
;    mp        - the domain predicate (e.g., o-p) for well-foundedness
;    rel       - the well-founded relation (e.g., o<)
;    hints     - their translated hints, to be used during the proofs of
;                the measure conjectures, all flattened into a single list

;    bodies    - their translated bodies
;    symbol-class
;              - :program, :ideal, or :common-lisp-compliant
;    normalizeps
;              - list of Booleans, used to determine for each fn in the clique
;                whether its body is to be normalized

;; ; This function does all of the syntactic checking associated with defuns.  It

;; ; "real" value of the function is a list of items extracted from lst during the
;; ; checking.  These items are:

;; ;    names     - the names of the fns in the clique
;; ;    arglists  - their formals
;; ;    docs      - their documentation strings
;; ;    pairs     - the (section-symbol . citations) pairs parsed from docs
;; ;    guards    - their translated guards
;; ;    measures  - their translated measure terms
;; ;    ruler-extenders-lst
;; ;              - their ruler-extenders
;; ;    mp        - the domain predicate (e.g., o-p) for well-foundedness
;; ;    rel       - the well-founded relation (e.g., o<)
;; ;    hints     - their translated hints, to be used during the proofs of
;; ;                the measure conjectures, all flattened into a single list
;; ;                of hints of the form ((cl-id . settings) ...).

;; ;                untranslated
;; ;    std-hints (always returned, but only of interest when
;; ;               #+:non-standard-analysis)
;; ;              - like hints but to be used for the std-p conjectures
;; ;    otf-flg   - t or nil, used as "Onward Thru the Fog" arg for prove
;; ;    bodies    - their translated bodies
;; ;    symbol-class
;; ;              - :program, :ideal, or :common-lisp-compliant
;; ;    normalizeps
;; ;              - list of Booleans, used to determine for each fn in the clique
;; ;                whether its body is to be normalized
;; ;    reclassifyingp
;; ;              - t or nil, t if this is a reclassifying from :program
;; ;                with identical defs.
;; ;    wrld      - a modified wrld in which the following properties
;; ;                may have been stored for each fn in names:
;; ;                  'formals, 'stobjs-in and 'stobjs-out
;; ;    non-executablep - t or nil according to whether these defuns are to
;; ;                  non-executable.  Non-executable defuns may violate the
;; ;                  translate conventions on stobjs.

  ;; termination method to be used (:hybrid or :ccg), contexts are the
  ;; contexts for the functions, ccm-hints is a list of pairs as defined by
  ;; combine-ccm-hints, cpn, verbose, time-limit, and ccm-comparison-scheme are the
  ;; user-specified CCG options, arglists is the list of lists of
  ;; formals for the functions, measures are the user-specified
  ;; measures, t-machines are the termination machines of the
  ;; functions, mp and rel are the domain and relation for proving
  ;; termination with a measure and otf-flg is the on-through-the-fog
  ;; flag.

  ;; If we succeed, we return 4 values, consed together as "the" value
  ;; in this error/value/state producing function. The first value is
  ;; the proof method that ultimately proved termination (:ccg or
  ;; :measure). The second value is the "justification" alist. For a
  ;; measure-based proof, this is the measure-alist, and for a
  ;; CCG-based proof, this is the result of
  ;; ccg-generate-measure-alist. The last two values are the column
  ;; and ttree. Currently, we simply return 0 for the column and nil
  ;; for the ttree. I believe the column value is correct, but the
  ;; ttree should eventually be the accumulation of all the ttrees
  ;; associated with all the proofs done in the termination analysis.

  ;; it is a signal that there is only one element of names and it is
  ;; a non-recursive function.  In that case, we short-circuit all of
  ;; the proof machinery and simply do the associated output.  We
  ;; coded it this way to preserve the invariant that
  ;; prove-termination is THE place the defun output is initiated.

  ;; This function increments timers.  Upon entry, any accumulated time
  ;; is charged to 'other-time.  The printing done herein is charged
  ;; to 'print-time and the proving is charged to 'prove-time.

; WARNING: This function installs a world.  That is safe at the time of this
; writing because this function is only called by defuns-fn0, which is only
; called by defuns-fn, where that call is protected by a revert-world-on-error.

; We are processing a clique of mutually recursive functions with the names,
; arglists, measures, ruler-extenders-lst, and bodies given.  All of the above
; lists are in 1:1 correspondence.  The hints is the result of appending
; together all of the hints provided.  Mp and rel are the domain predicate and
; well-founded relation to be used.  We attempt to prove the admissibility of
; the recursions.  We cause an error if any proof fails.  We put a lot of
; properties under the function symbols, namely:

;    recursivep                     all fns in names
;    justification                  all recursive fns in names
;    induction-machine              the singly recursive fn in name*
;    quick-block-info               the singly recursive fn in name*
;    symbol-class :ideal            all fns in names

; *If names consists of exactly one recursive fn, we store its
; induction-machine and its quick-block-info, otherwise we do not.

; If no error occurs, we return a triple consisting of the column the printer
; is in, the final value of wrld and a tag tree documenting the proofs we did.

; Note: The function could be declared to return 5 values, but we would rather
; use the standard state and error primitives and so it returns 3 and lists
; together the three "real" answers.

; The put above stores a note on each function symbol as to whether it is
; recursive or not.  An important question arises: have we inadventently
; assumed something axiomatically about inadmissible functions?  We say no.

; care about properties such as 'recursivep.  However, we make use of this

; Important Note:  Don't change the formals of this function without

; On Guards

; When a function symbol fn is defund the user supplies a guard, g, and a
; body b.  Logically speaking, the axiom introduced for fn is

;    (fn x1...xn) = b.

; After admitting fn, the guard-related properties are set as follows:

; prop                after defun

; body                   b*
; guard                  g
; unnormalized-body      b
; type-prescription      computed from b
; symbol-class           :ideal

; * We actually normalize the above.  During normalization we may expand some
; boot-strap non-rec fns.

; In addition, we magically set the symbol-function of fn

; symbol-function        b

; and the symbol-function of *1*fn as a program which computes the logical
; value of (fn x).  However, *1*fn is quite fancy because it uses the raw body
; in the symbol-function of fn if fn is :common-lisp-compliant, and may signal
; a guard error if 'guard-checking-on is set to other than nil or :none.  See
; oneify-cltl-code for the details.

; Observe that the symbol-function after defun may be a form that
; violates the guards on primitives.  Until the guards in fn are
; checked, we cannot let raw Common Lisp evaluate fn.

; Intuitively, we think of the Common Lisp programmer intending to defun (fn
; x1...xn) to be b, and is declaring that the raw fn can be called only on
; arguments satisfying g.  The need for guards stems from the fact that there
; are many Common Lisp primitives, such as car and cdr and + and *, whose
; behavior outside of their guarded domains is unspecified.  To use these
; functions in the body of fn one must "guard" fn so that it is never called in
; a way that would lead to the violation of the primitive guards.  Thus, we
; make a formal precondition on the use of the Common Lisp program fn that the
; guard g, along with the tests along the various paths through body b, imply
; each of the guards for every subroutine in b.  We also require that each of
; the guards in g be satisfied.  This is what we mean when we say fn is
; :common-lisp-compliant.

; It is, however, often impossible to check the guards at defun time.  For
; example, if fn calls itself recursively and then gives the result to +, we
; would have to prove that the guard on + is satisfied by fn's recursive
; result, before we admit fn.  In general, induction may be necessary to
; establish that the recursive calls satisfy the guards of their masters;
; hence, it is probably also necessary for the user to formulate general lemmas
; about fn to establish those conditions.  Furthermore, guard checking is no
; longer logically necessary and hence automatically doing it at defun time may
; be a waste of time.

  :short "A powerful automated termination prover for ACL2"
  :long "<p>In order to see how the CCG analysis works, consider the following
 definition of Ackermann's function from exercise 6.15 in the ACL2
 textbook:</p>

 @({
  (defun ack (x y)
     (if (zp x)
         1
       (if (zp y)
           (if (equal x 1) 2 (+ x 2))
         (ack (ack (1- x) y) (1- y)))))

 })

 <p>ACL2 cannot automatically prove the termination of @('ack') using its
  measure-based termination proof. In order to admit the function, the user
  must supply a measure. An example measure is @('(make-ord 1 (1+ (acl2-count
  y)) (acl2-count x))'), which is equivalent to the ordinal @('w * (1+
  (acl2-count y)) + (acl2-count x)'), where @('w') is the first infinite
  ordinal.</p>

 <p>The CCG analysis, on the other hand, automatically proves termination as
 follows. Note that there are two recursive calls. These calls, along with
 their rulers (i.e. the conditions under which the recursive call is reached)
 are called <i>calling contexts</i>, or sometimes just <i>contexts</i> (for
 more on rulers, see @(see ruler-extenders)). For @('ack'), these are:</p>

 @({
  1. (ack (1- x) y) with ruler ((not (zp x)) (not (zp y))).
  2. (ack (ack (1- x) y) (1- y)) with ruler ((not (zp x)) (not (zp y))).
 })

 <p>These calling contexts are used to build a <i>calling context graph
 (CCG)</i>, from which our analysis derives its name. This graph has an edge
 from context @('c1') to context @('c2') when it is possible that execution can
 move from context @('c1') to context @('c2') in one ``step'' (i.e. without
 visiting any other contexts). For our example, we get the complete graph, with
 edges from each context to both contexts.</p>

 <p>The analysis next attempts to guess <i>calling context measures (CCMs)</i>,
 or just <i>measures</i>, for each function. These are similar to ACL2
 measures, in that they are ACL2 terms that must provably be able to evaluate
 to an ordinal value (unlike ACL2 measures, CCG currently ignores the current
 well-founded relation setting). However, functions may have multiple CCMs,
 instead of one, like ACL2, and the CCG analysis has some more sophisticated
 heuristics for guessing appropriate measures. However, there is a mechanism
 for supplying measures to the CCG analysis if you need to see @(see
 CCG-XARGS). In our example, the CCG analysis will guess the measures
 @('(acl2-count x)'), @('(acl2-count y)'), and @('(+ (acl2-count x) (acl2-count
 y))'). This last one turns out to be unimportant for the termination
 proof. However, note that the first two of these measures are components of
 the ordinal measure that we gave ACL2 to prove termination earlier. As one
 might guess, these are important for the success of our CCG analysis.</p>

 <p>Like ACL2's measure analysis, we are concerned with what happens to these
 values when a recursive call is made. However, we are concerned not just with
 decreasing measures, but also non-increasing measures. Thus, we construct
 <i>Calling Context Measure Functions (CCMFs)</i>, which tell us how one
 measure compares to another across recursive calls.</p>

 <p>In our example, note that when the recursive call of the context 1 is made,
 the new value of @('(acl2-count x)') is less than the original value of
 @('(acl2-count x)'). More formally, we can prove the following:</p>

 @({
  (implies (and (not (zp x))
                (not (zp y)))
           (o< (acl2-count (1- x))
               (acl2-count x)))
 })

 <p>For those of you that are familiar with measure-based termination proofs in
 ACL2, this should look familiar, as it has the same structure as such a
 termination proof. However, we also note the following trivial
 observation:</p>

 @({
  (implies (and (not (zp x))
                (not (zp y)))
           (o<= (acl2-count y)
                (acl2-count y)))
 })

 <p>That is, @('y') stays the same across this recursive call. For the other
 context, we similarly note that @('(acl2-count y)') is decreasing. However, we
 can say nothing about the value of @('(acl2-count x)'). The CCG algorithm does
 this analysis using queries to the theorem prover that are carefully
 restricted to limit prover time.</p>

 <p>Finally, the CCG analysis uses this local information to do a global
 analysis of what happens to values. This analysis asks the question, for every
 infinite path through our CCG, @('c_1'), @('c_2'), @('c_3'), ..., is there a
 natural number @('N') such that there is an infinite sequence of measures
 @('m_N'), @('m_(N+1)'), @('m_(N+2)'), ... such that each @('m_i') is a measure
 for the context @('c_i') (i.e. a measure for the function containing @('ci')),
 we have proven that the @('m_(i+1)') is never larger than @('m_i'), and for
 infinitely many @('i'), it is the case that we have proven that @('m_i') is
 always larger than @('m_(i+)'). That's a bit of a mouthful, but what we are
 essentially saying is that, for every possible infinite sequence of recursions
 it is the case that after some finite number of steps, we can start picking
 out measures such that they never increase and infinitely often they
 decrease. Since these measures return ordinal values, we then know that there
 can be no infinite recursions, and we are done.</p>

 <p>For our example, consider two kinds of infinite paths through our CCG:
 those that visit context 2 infinitely often, and those that don't. In the
 first case, we know that @('(acl2-count y)') is never increasing, since a
 visit to context 1 does not change the value of @('y'), and a visit to context
 2 decreases the value of @('(acl2-count y)'). Furthermore, since we visit
 context 2 infinitely often, we know that @('(acl2-count y)') is infinitely
 decreasing along this path. Therefore, we have met the criteria for proving no
 such path is a valid computation. In the case in which we do not visit context
 2 infinitely often, there must be a value @('N') such that we do not visit
 context 2 any more after the @('N')th context in the path. After this, we must
 only visit context 1, which always decreases the value of @('(acl2-count
 x)'). Therefore, no such path can be a valid computation. Since all infinite
 paths through our CCG either visit context 2 infinitely often or not, we have
 proven termination. This analysis of the local data in the global context is
 done automatically by a decision procedure.</p>

 <p>That is a brief overview of the CCG analysis. Note that, can it prove many
 functions terminating that ACL2 cannot. It also does so using simpler
 measures. In the @('ack') example, we did not require any infinite ordinal
 measures to prove termination using CCG. Intuitively, CCG is in a way putting
 together the measures for you so you don't have to think about the ordinal
 structure. Thus, even when the CCG analysis to prove termination, it is often
 easier to give it multiple simple measures and allow it to put together the
 global termination argument than to give ACL2 the entire measure so it can
 prove that it decreases every single step.</p>

 number @('n'), @('ccm-cs') is one of @(':EQUAL'), @(':ALL'), @(':SOME'), or
 @(':NONE'), and @('cpn') is @('t') or @('nil').</p>

 <p>Each level of the hierarchy describes techniques used to prove
 termination. Termination proofs performed after admitting this event will use
 the specified techniques in the order in which they are listed.</p>

 <p>Basically, the CCG analysis as described and illustrated at a high level in
 the documentation for @(see CCG) can potentially be very expensive. In order
 to make the analysis as efficient as possible, we use less expensive (and less
 powerful) techniques first, and resort to more powerful and expensive
 techniques only when these fail.</p>

 <p>There are three ways of varying the CCG analysis, which are represented by
 each of the three elements in a hierarchy level (levels of the form
 @('(:measure pt)') will be explained later).</p>

 <p>@('Pt') tells the CCG analysis how to limit proof attempts. The idea behind
 this is that ACL2 is designed to prove statements that the user thinks are
 true. It therefore does everything it can to prove the conjecture. As ACL2
 useres already know, this can lead to very long, or even non-terminating proof
 attempts. The CCG analysis, on the other hand, sends multiple queries to the
 theorem prover that may or may not be true, in order to improve the accuracy
 of the analysis. It is therefore necessary to reign in ACL2's proof attempts
 to keep them from taking too long. Of course, the trade-off is that, the more
 we limit ACL2's prover, the less powerful it becomes.</p>

 <p>@('Pt') can be @(':built-in-clauses'), which tells ACL2 to use only <see
 topic='@(url acl2::broken-link)'>built-in-clauses</see> analysis. This is a
 very fast, and surprisingly powerful proof technique. For example, the
 definition of Ackermann's function given in the documentation for @(see CCG)
 is solved using only this proof technique.</p>

 <p>@('Pt') can also be of the form @('(:induction-depth n)'), where @('n') is
 a natural number. This uses the full theorem prover, but limits it in two
 ways. First, it stops proof attempts if ACL2 has been working on a subgoal
 with no case splitting or induction for 20 steps (that is, at a goal of the
 form 1.5'20'). It also limits the <i>induction depth</i>, which describes how
 many times we allow induction goals to lead to further induction goals. For
 example, @('(:induction-depth 0)') allows no induction, while
 @('(:induction-depth 1)') allows goals of the form @('*1') or @('*2'), but
 stops if it creates a goal such as @('*1.1') or @('*2.1').</p>

 <p>@('Ccm-cs') limits which CCMs are compared using the theorem
 prover. Consider again the @('ack') example in the documentation for @(see
 CCG). All we needed was to compare the value of @('(acl2-count x)') before and
 after the recursive call and the value of @('(acl2-count y)') before and after
 the recursive call. We would learn nothing, and waste time with the theorem
 prover if we compared @('(acl2-count x)') to @('(acl2-count y)'). However,
 other times, it is important to compare CCMs with each other, for example,
 when arguments are permuted, or we are dealing with a mutual recursion.</p>

 <p>@('Ccm-cs') can be one of @(':EQUAL'), @(':ALL'), @(':SOME'), or
 @(':NONE'). These limit which CCMs we compare based on the variables they
 mention. Let @('c') be a recursive call in the body of function @('f') that
 calls function @('g'). Let @('m1') be a CCM for @('f') and @('m2') be a CCM
 for @('g'). Let @('v1') be the formals mentioned in @('m1') and @('v2') be the
 formals mentioned in @('m2'') where @('m2'') is derived from @('m2') by
 substituting the formals of @('g') with the actuals of @('c'). For example,
 consider following function:</p>

 @({
  (defun f (x)
    (if (endp x)
        0
      (1+ (f (cdr x)))))
 })

 <p>Now consider the case where @('m1') and @('m2') are both the measure
 @('(acl2-count x)'). Then if we look at the recursive call @('(f (cdr x))') in
 the body of @('f'), then @('m2'') is the result of replacing @('x') with
 @('(cdr x)') in @('m2'), i.e., @('(acl2-count (cdr x))').</p>

 <p>If @('ccm-cs') is @(':EQUAL') we will compare @('m1') to @('m2') if @('v1')
 and @('v2') are equal. If @('value') is @(':ALL') we will compare @('m1') to
 @('m2'') if @('v2') is a subset of @('v1'). If @('value') is @(':SOME') we
 will compare @('m1') to @('m2'') if @('v1') and @('v2') intersect. If
 @('value') is @(':NONE') we will compare @('m1') to @('m2') no matter
 what.</p>

 <p>There is one caveat to what was just said: if @('m1') and @('m2') are
 syntactically equal, then regardless of the value of @('ccm-cs') we will
 construct a CCMF that will indicate that @('(o>= m1 m2)').</p>

 <p>@('Cpn') tells us how much ruler information we will use to compare CCMs.
 Unlike ACL2's measure-based termination analysis, CCG has the ability to use
 the rulers from both the current recursive call the next recursive call when
 constructing the CCMFs. That is, instead of asking ``What happens when I make
 recursive call A?'', we can ask, ``What happens when execution moves from
 recursive call A to recursive call B?''. Using this information potentially
 strengthens the termination analysis. For a brief example, consider the
 following code:</p>

 @({
  (defun half (x)
     (if (zp x)
         0
       (1+ (half (- x 2)))))
 })

 <p>Clearly this is terminating. If we choose a measure of @('(nfix x)') we
 know that if @('x') is a positive integer, @('(nfix (- x 2))') is less than
 @('(nfix x)'). But consider the measure @('(acl2-count x)'). The strange thing
 here is that if @('x') is 1, then @('(acl2-count (- x 2))') is @('(acl2-count
 -1)'), which is 1, i.e. the @('acl2-count') of @('x'). So, the fact that we
 know that @('x') is a positive integer is not enough to show that this measure
 decreases. But notice that if @('x') is 1, we will recur just one more
 time. So, if we consider what happens when we move from the recursive call
 back to itself. In this case we know @('(and (not (zp x)) (not (zp (- x
 2))))').  Under these conditions, it is trivial for ACL2 to prove that
 @('(acl2-count (- x 2))') is always less than @('(acl2-count x)').

 However, this can make the CCG analysis much more expensive, since information
 about how values change from step to step are done on a per-edge, rather than
 a per-node basis in the CCG (where the nodes are the recursive calls and the
 edges indicate that execution can move from one call to another in one
 step). Thus, calculating CCMFs (how values change across recursive calls) on a
 per-edge basis rather than a per-node basis can require n^2 instead of n
 prover queries.</p>

 <p>If @('cpn') is @('t'), we will use only the ruler of the current recursive
 call to compute our CCMFs. If it is @('nil'), we will use the much more
 expensive technique of using the rulers of the current and next call.</p>

 <p>Levels of the hierarchy of the form @('(:measure pt)') specify that the CCG
 analysis is to be set aside for a step, and the traditional measure-based
 termination proof is to be attempted. Here, @('pt') has the same meaning as it
 does in a CCG hierarchy level. That is, it limits the measure proof in order
 to avoid prohibitively long termination analyses.</p>

 <p>The user may specify their own hierarchy in the form given above. The main
 restriction is that no level may be subsumed by an earlier level. That is, it
 should be the case at each level of the hierarchy, that it is possible to
 discover new information about the CCG that could help lead to a termination
 proof.</p>

 <p>In addition to constructing his or her own CCG hierarchy, the user may use
 several preset hierarchies:</p>

 <p>Introduced by the CCG analysis book, this macro sets the default means by
 which ACL2 will prove termination. Note: This is an event!  It does not print
 the usual event summary but nevertheless changes the ACL2 logical @(see world)
 and is so recorded.</p>

 @({
   General Form:
  (set-termination-method tm)
 })

 <p>where @('tm') is @(':CCG') or @(':MEASURE'). The default is @(':MEASURE')
 (chosen to assure compatibility with books created without CCG). The
 recommended setting is @(':CCG'). This macro is equivalent to @('(table
 acl2-defaults-table :termination-method 'tm)'), and hence is @(tsee local) to
 any @(see books) and @(tsee encapsulate) @(see events) in which it occurs; see
 @(see acl2-defaults-table).</p>

 <p>When the termination-method is set to @(':CCG'), a termination proof is
 attempted using the the hierarchical CCG algorithm <a
 href='CCG-hierarchy'>CCG-hierarchy</a>.</p>

 <p>When the termination-method is set to @(':MEASURE'), ACL2 attempts to prove
 termination using its default measure-based method. Thus, in this setting,
 ACL2's behavior is identical to that when the CCG book is not included at
 all.</p>

 <p>To see what the current termination method setting is, use @(tsee
 get-termination-method).</p>")
