To certify the books use the standard procedure i.e. make
or use ../cert.pl ccg.cert ccg-settings-dependencies.cert

To get CCG to do termination proofs, use the following two commands.

(include-book "acl2s/ccg/ccg" :ttags ((:ccg)) :dir :system :load-compiled-file nil)
(ld "acl2s/ccg/ccg-settings.lsp" :dir :system)
