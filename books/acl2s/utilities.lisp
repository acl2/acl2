; Symbol generation utilities

; The following functions, macros and theorems are used to generate
; symbols. A general principle for symbol generation is that generated
; symbols should be in the current package. Doing that in ACL2
; requires using make-event in a top level form to determine the
; current package from state and then passing this package to
; functions that generate symbols. The code below is used in
; defthm.lisp to define defequiv, defrefinement and defcong.
