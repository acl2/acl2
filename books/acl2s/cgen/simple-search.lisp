;;;; * Main Idea
;;;; Given any formula, we want to test it using test? or
;;;; amidst a prove call.  By test it, I mean we search for an
;;;; instantiation (or assignment) of the free variables in the
;;;; formula *and* evaluate the ground formula resulting from
;;;; substituting the assignment.  The way 'Cgen' (name of our
;;;; implementation) works is as follows. We set up the type
;;;; infrastructure, i.e we store type meta data in ACL2 tables for
;;;; all primitive/basic types in ground ACL2 and provide the user
;;;; with macros (defdata) to introduce new types. These macros
;;;; automate maintenance of type meta data. The metadata henceforth
;;;; called defdata tables, store the enumerators for each type
;;;; predicate, and also capture the relationship (subtype and
;;;; disjoint) among the different types. The latter are useful in
;;;; finding the minimal (possible) type information for a variable
;;;; constrained by multiple predicates/relations. When we say 'type',
;;;; we refer to a name that characterizes a set in the ACL2
;;;; Universe. This 'type' is characterized redundantly both with a
;;;; predicate and an enumerator. When the user asks
;;;; to test?/thm a conjecture, Cgen queries the defdata tables to
;;;; obtain the name of the corresponding enumerator for each variable
;;;; constrained by a monadic predicate in the conjecture.  In
;;;; practice what Cgen derives is not an enumerator function but an
;;;; enumerat(or/ing) expression with holes. When these holes are filled
;;;; with random natural numbers, it will evaluate to a random value
;;;; satisfying the type-like constraints of the concerned
;;;; variable in the conjecture under test. Also in practice there is
;;;; dependency among variables and naively instantiating all of them
;;;; independently will lead to poor test data, since the full
;;;; assignment might turn out to be vacuous (inconsistent hypotheses)
;;;; many a time. (And this indeed is the main hurdle to be crossed).
;;;; 
;;;; Clearly to obtain the best results, we want to be able to do the
;;;; following things.
;;;; 1. Derive an enumerator expression for each variable that
;;;; evaluates to a minimal set of values, the variable is allowed to
;;;; take.
;;;; 2. Derive an enumerator expression for each
;;;; variable that takes into account its dependency on other
;;;; variables. i.e If (= x (f y)) and (posp y), then enumerator
;;;; expression call (enumcall) for y is (nth-pos n) and for x it is
;;;; simply (f y). Thus x never evaluates to a value that would make
;;;; its constraint inconsistent. Things are more complicated for
;;;; mutually-dependent variables and for complex dependency
;;;; relations. 
;;;; 
;;;; Feb 3 2012
;;;; This is basically a constraint satisfaction problem and there exist
;;;; naive backtracking algorithms for finite-domain variables. There also
;;;; exists the notion of arc-consistency, which basically tells you if it
;;;; is possible to extend an partial assignment without backtracking. So
;;;; the "ideal scenario" is to construct the assignment without backtracking.

;;;; Right now, in one search strategy, which is named "simple", we
;;;; simply compute enumerator/type expressions for all free
;;;; variables, taking into account "equality" dependencies and use
;;;; this as a template code to plug in random natural numbers or
;;;; bounded consecutive natural number tuples to obtain either random
;;;; value assignment or a consecutive value assignment in the bounded
;;;; value space of free variables. 

;;;; Alternatively, in the DPLL-style search strategy, which we named
;;;; as "incremental", we incrementally build the assignment, taking
;;;; into account dependency, by selecting the least "dependent"
;;;; variable in the dependency graph built from the conjecture. After
;;;; every variable is assigned a new value (satisfying its local type
;;;; constraints), this information is propagated using the theorem
;;;; prover itself. If the resulting hypotheses of the partially
;;;; instantiated conjecture are contradictory/inconsistent, then we
;;;; backtrack to the last "decision" Assign. We stop when we either
;;;; backtrack too many times, or we have obtained the full value
;;;; assignment (called sigma hereafter).

;;;; The following illustrates the top-level driver pseudocode

;;;; Top-level test driver loop for Conjecture/Subgoal G
;;;; All type alists below have as keys the free variables of G.

;;;; Initialization code:
;;;; defattach conclusion-val/hypotheses-val for G
;;;; T_naive := get naive type alist from defdata tables for G
;;;; T_ACL2  := get ACL2 type alist for freevars(G)
;;;; T_final := get type expression alist for freevars(G) using
;;;;            T_naive, T_ACL2 and the dependency graph of G.
;;;; E := get enumerator expression alist for G using T_final
;;;; make defun next-sigma using E and random seed, BE arg tuple
;;;; defattach next-sigma to a fun computing assignments
;;;;   
;;;;
;;;; Driver loop code:
;;;; repeat *num-trial* times or till we meet stopping condition
;;;; \sigma := (next-sigma ...)
;;;;   if (hypotheses-val \sigma)
;;;;      if (conclusion-val \sigma)
;;;;         record witness 
;;;;       record counterexample
;;;;    record vacuous
;;;; end
;;;;
;;;; conclusion-val and hypotheses-val are stub functions which
;;;; are attached during the main search function.
;;;; They take a substitution and apply it to G, returning a boolean.

; [2014-08-30 Sat] Use ld instead of trans-eval+make-event
; Reasons:
; - ld can catch raw lisp errors (although it cannot suppress its error message). Note that we would like to fix any raw lisp errors of Cgen.
; - ld does not use make-event and so can be used in non-event contexts (This is important for Cgen to be used as an API)
; - ld restores previous world on error (We always arrange for the error to be produced at the end) 
; - Can be switched to wormholes if needed. (But then we cant use state to share the result of run-tests)
; - Is this parallelizable? Are wormholes?
; [2014-09-21 Sun] Reverted back to trans-eval. It is simpler and hopefully the interrupt story is saner!
; But we still dont use make-event, due to which we have to redef.
