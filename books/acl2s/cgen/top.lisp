<h3>Using Cgen</h3>
<p>
Cgen is available and enabled in all ACL2 Sedan session modes except <i>Compatible</i>.
If it is not already available, you can use Cgen simply be submitting the following
commands:
@({
  (include-book \"acl2s/cgen/top\" :dir :system :ttags :all)
  (acl2s-defaults :set testing-enabled t)
})
</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p> Cgen is a powerful debugging facility that can be used to test/check
formulas for counterexamples automatically. It is implemented as a set of
books, tightly coupled with the @(see defdata) framework. Thus for the most
profitable use of Cgen, one should specify all type-like monadic predicates
using @('defdata') or at least register such predicates as defdata types using
@('register-type').  When Cgen is in effect via the @('testing-enabled')
parameter, every checkpoint subgoal arising in event contexts such as @('thm'),
@('defthm') and @('verify-guards') is checked (searched) for
counterexamples. So although you can integrate Cgen seamlessly in your
interactive proof workflow, we recommend the use of the specially designed
macro, <i>test?</i>.  </p>

<h3>To prove use <tt>thm</tt>, to disprove use <tt>test?</tt></h3>

<p> One can use @('test?') as a drop-in replacement for @('thm')
to disprove conjectures.  @('test?') guarantees that
counterexamples are printed in terms of the top goal's
variables. See @(see test?) for more details and examples.</p>

<h3>More Powerful Theorem Proving</h3>

<p>
Cgen also defeats false generalizations. We have seen many
examples where defthms succeed with @('testing-enabled') because
Cgen falsified a bad generalization, thereby causing ACL2 to
@('backtrack') and modify its proof search path.
</p>

<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Examine the proof output to see the backtracking.</p>
@({
  (acl2s-defaults :set testing-enabled t) ;try first with nil
  (defthm no-duplicates-remove
    (implies (and (true-listp list)
                  (no-duplicatesp list))
             (no-duplicatesp (remove x list))))
})


<h3>Control Parameters</h3>

<p> The Cgen library can be configured via a collection of parameters using the
  @('acl2s-defaults') macro using the <tt>:get</tt> or <tt>:set</tt> keyword
  arguments. In particular, see @('num-trials'), @('verbosity-level'),
  @('testing-enabled'). All the control parameters are package-agnostic.  </p>

<h3> Advanced Notes </h3>


<p>The API functions/macros for Cgen library reside in the ACL2S package. Use
list (<tt>*acl2s-exports*</tt>) to import these symbols into your own
package.</p>

<h3>More details</h3>

   )

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p> @('test?') is a powerful counterexample generation facility,
based on random testing, that is intended to be used to increase
confidence in the truth of a conjecture by providing extensive
testing.</p>

<p> @('test?') combines random testing with the power of ACL2 via our data
definition framework (@(see defdata)). It guarantees that any counterexamples
generated are truly counterexamples to the original conjecture. A
counterexample is just a binding that maps the variables in the original
conjecture to values in the ACL2 universe. In cases where the value of
variables are irrelevant, we bind the variables to the symbol @('?') : these
bindings still provide counterexamples, but should raise alarms, since chances
are that there is a specification error. </p>

<p> If no counterexample is found, there are three possibilities. First, it is
possible that the conjecture is false, in which case increasing the amount of
testing we do may lead to the discovery of a counterexample.  Second, it is
also possible that ACL2 proves that the conjecture is true, in which case we
print a message reporting success.  Finally, the conjecture may be true, but
ACL2 cannot prove it.  For all of these three cases, we consider testing to
have succeeded, so @('test?') will report success. </p>

<p>@('test?') is an embedded event and can be used in ACL2 @(see acl2::books). But it
is recommended to use them only in the design and in the debug phase, since its
use requires trust-tags.</p>

<h3> Control Parameters </h3>

<p> We can furthur control the behavior of test? using keyword options or
@('acl2s-defaults'). All the parameters in @('acl2s-defaults') are available as
keyword options to the @('test?') macro and they override the current defaults.
The most important parameters to tweak are
@(see num-trials), @(see verbosity-level), @(see testing-enabled).</p>

<h3> Advanced Notes </h3>

<p> We note that in order to be able to generate counterexamples, we do not
allow ACL2 to use any of the following processes: induction, generalization,
and cross-fertilization. We do allow destructor-elimination, though in rare
cases, user defined elim rules may generalize the conjecture. Such situations
are recognized.  If you want to enable the above processes, use @('thm')
instead, but note that counterexamples shown might not be of the top-level
conjecture.  </p>

"<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p> This is the main API function to test/check a form for counterexamples with
the full power of prove (and hints), i.e. @('prove/cgen') actually calls
@('prove') as a subfunction. You can accomplish the same thing using @('thm,
defthm') with the acl2s defaults parameter @('testing-enabled') set to @('T'),
but this function gives the user/caller more control: the user is responsible
to pass @('cgen-state') (use @('make-cgen-state') to construct one), that
provides the <i>context</i> for cgen/testing; the results and statistics
summarizing Cgen/testing are collected in cgen-state and this is returned to
the caller. </p>

<h3>General Form:</h3>
@({(prove/cgen form hints cgen-state state) => (mv erp cgen-state state)})

<p> The @('erp') part of result is @('nil'), if call to @('prove') was
successful, it is @(':falsifiable') if there is at least one
counterexample (not necessarily top-level), it is @('t') if there was a error
in trans-eval call of prove (usually a hard/raw lisp error), it is @(':?')
otherwise, which points out that we could neither prove nor disprove the
conjecture under consideration </p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p> For an example of the use of @('prove/cgen'), you can study the
implementation of the @('test?') macro itself found in cgen/top.lisp. To see
the structure of @('cgen-state'), you can study the
@('print-testing-summary-fn') function which deconstructs it and prints its
information in a human-readable form. </p>
