(in-package "ACL2")

inline-book.lisp
----------------

Peter Dillinger, 22 July 2008

This book has two rough replacements for INCLUDE-BOOK that don't require the
referenced book to be certified separately.  Basically, we use make-event to
"inline" all the events from the referenced book into the current book.
This enables one to split a single ACL2 book across several files, which can
be in different packages.

We handle in-package clauses and the acl2-defaults-table properly, but we
assume the portcullis is already satisfied.  One version, "inline-book,"
does not respect LOCAL events in the referenced book, while the other,
"encapsulate-book," does.  Also, (local (inline-book ...)) is not supported
but (local (encapsulate-book ...)) should work.

;The syntax is to replace "include-book" with "inline-book" or
"encapsulate-book," except that only the book name and any :dir argument are
used by inline-book.  All the other parameters are ignored/irrelevant and the
effect is that they are inherited from the parent book. 


In a feat of make-event foo, the inclusion of this book can itself be inlined:

;(make-event
; (er-progn (ld "inline-book.lisp")
;           (make-event (compute-inline-book-value "inline-book"))))

Explanation:
;  (ld "inline-book.lisp") loads the definitions in this file but they only
persist for computing the next result.
  (compute-inline-book-value "inline-book") is able to complete because we
temporarily loaded in the definitions, and this returns all the forms in
this file for inlining into the current book.
