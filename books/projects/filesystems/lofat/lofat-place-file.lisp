;; We've actually gotten pretty close to precisely specifying when there
;; can be a space error and when there can't.
;; - We started off thinking that every directory tree with
;; (hifat-cluster-count ...) evaluating to a number less than the number of
;; available clusters would work, but we realised that would be false given the
;; recursive nature and the fact that other directory trees would, in general,
;; exist.
;;  - We then thought incrementally: the difference between clusters needed by
;; the new tree and the clusters needed by the old tree would be the number of
;; free clusters needed. This is surprisingly close to being true! However,
;; there are issues. Even in the case where we're inserting just one regular
;; file, we're going to have to update its parent directory, potentially
;; increasing its length. That gives us a correctness issue, in that we might
;; be making the directory contents longer than *ms-max-dir-size*. So... we
;; decide that inserting a new directory entry is a good time to pluck out the
;; parent and current directory entries, and discard all other useless entries
;; (i.e. entries for deleted files.) That resolves the correctness issue,
;; because it means that any directory tree which continues to satisfy
;; hifat-bounded-file-alist-p will be fine. However, that also immediately
;; raises the spectre of special treatment for the root directory, which does
;; not have parent and current directory entries. Moreover, since we're
;; changing the number of clusters in the root directory, we'll need to account
;; for those in addition to the hifat-cluster-count of the new tree... and so
;; the number of new clusters needed becomes the difference between the new
;; tree and the old tree in terms of the sum of clusters needed for the root
;; directory and clusters needed for the tree (awkward, I know, but unavoidable
;; given the definition of hifat-cluster-count.) This gives rise to a weird
;; situation where we might need, say, two free clusters for placing the
;; regular file, and we will have exactly two clusters freed up by removing
;; deleted directory entries from the root directories. We should be able to do
;; it, but we can't without entering a domain of utter madness where we
;; free all possible clusters first and then use them as needed, and the
;; atomicity of the various operations recedes far into the distance.
;; - We conclude thinking it's probably best for the *ENOSPC* error condition
;; not to be formally specified at all. We would be hamstringing ourselves
;; pretty severely if we tried to break atomicity and then (likely) had to
;; reimplement a bunch of things. We can still do some obvious things
;; though... we shouldn't be hanging on to useless directory entries when we're
;; adding new ones, and we shouldn't subject ourselves to clusters full of
;; zeroes, both of which point to sticking with the new implementation of
;; insert-d-e.

;; This works because as soon as both arguments are quoted constants, the
;; executable-counterpart will kick in. The availability of the
;; executable-counterpart will, however, have to be ensured
;; by a theory invariant.
