;; Here's the idea behind this recursion: A loop could occur on a badly formed
;; FAT32 volume which has a cycle in its directory structure (for instance, if
;; / and /tmp/ were to point to the same cluster as their initial cluster.)
;; This loop could be stopped most cleanly by maintaining a list of all
;; clusters which could be visited, and checking them off as we visit more
;; entries. Then, we would detect a second visit to the same cluster, and
;; terminate with an error condition. Only otherwise would we make a recursive
;; call, and our measure - the length of the list of unvisited clusters - would
;; decrease.

;; This would probably impose performance penalties, and so there's a better
;; way which does not (good!), and also does not cleanly detect cycles in the
;; directory structure (bad.) Still, it returns exactly the same result for
;; good FAT32 volumes, so it's acceptable. In this helper function, we set our
;; measure to be entry-limit, an upper bound on the number of entries we can
;; visit, and decrement every time we visit a new entry. In the main function,
;; we count the total number of visitable directory entries, by dividing the
;; entire length of the data region by *ms-d-e-length*, and set that as the
;; upper limit. This makes sure that we aren't disallowing any legitimate FAT32
;; volumes which just happen to be full of directories.

;; OK, this function needs to return a list of directory entries, so that when
;; it is called recursively to take care of all the entries in a subdirectory,
;; the caller gets the list of these entries and becomes able to concatenate
;; them all together, add entries in the front for "." and "..", and then treat
;; the result as the contents of a file. In this scenario, the
;; caller must allocate one cluster even before making the recursive call for
;; the subdirectory, because  the FAT spec says, on page 26, "One cluster is
;; allocated to the directory (unless it is the root directory on a FAT16/FAT12
;; volume), and you set DIR_FstClusLO and DIR_FstClusHI to that cluster number
;; and place an EOC mark in that cluster's entry in the FAT." Now, after the
;; recursive call returns a list of entries, the caller can create a "." entry
;; using the index of the cluster allocated for this subdirectory before this
;; call, and a ".." entry using its own first cluster. However, it cannot know
;; its own first cluster without having it passed from its parent, so this must
;; be an extra argument to the recursive call.
;; Purely for proof purposes, we're also going to have to return an extra
;; argument, namely, the list of indices we used. That will be (mv-nth 3 ...)
;; of the thing.

  ;; We tried (in commit aaf008a0e4edf4343b3d33e23d4aeff897cb1138) removing the
  ;; three place-contents-expansion rules in favour of rules which do not
  ;; introduce case splits. This is not easily doable, because the case split
  ;; based on the emptiness of the file contents is necessary for Subgoal *1/3
  ;; of this induction. Either we'd have to do the case split in a different
  ;; rule, or else we'd have to introduce a hint for Subgoal *1/3 - neither
  ;; seems very much better than the status quo. Therefore, this will remain
  ;; the slowest proof because the case splitting is necessary.

;; The proof of this theorem, and the subsequent removal of its hypotheses,
;; have significantly influenced the development of the model. We really want
;; the number of hypotheses for lofat-equiv to be the bare minimum, because
;; lofat-equiv is just an important predicate, around which we are building a
;; number of proofs. The git history will show the precise details, but at
;; various points we've removed hypotheses stating that the outcome of
;; lofat-to-hifat satisfied hifat-bounded-file-alist-p and
;; hifat-file-no-dups-p. The following paragraphs, written at an earlier point,
;; describe why one of these clauses was hard to remove. We ultimately removed
;; it by requiring all clusterchains to be distinct from each other.
;;
;; This clause should almost always be true (which is a difficult thing to say
;; in a theorem-proving setting...) The argument is: The only time we get an
;; error out of hifat-to-lofat-helper (and the wrapper) is when we run out of
;; space. We shouldn't be able to run out of space when we just extracted an m1
;; instance from fat32$c, and we didn't change the size of
;; fat32$c at all. However, that's going to involve reasoning about the
;; number of clusters taken up by an m1 instance, which is not really where
;; it's at right now.
;;
;; One reason why this clause will not always be true: we aren't
;; requiring dot and dotdot entries to exist (except vaguely, by making
;; sure that we don't have 65535 or 65536 useful directory entries in
;; any directory.)  As a result, it's possible for a lofat instance to
;; exist which completely fills up the available clusters on the disk,
;; but which leaves out at least one dot or dotdot entry, with the
;; result that attempting to remake the stobj after converting to hifat
;; would cause the directory with the missing dot/dotdot entry to cross
;; a cluster boundary and therefore occupy more space than available in
;; the stobj. This scenario wouldn't even need a directory with 65535 or
;; 65536 useful directory entries. The largest possible cluster size for
;; FAT32 is 2^15 bytes, which is a multiple of all other possible
;; cluster sizes - so let's consider an example where a directory
;; contains 2^11 useful directory entries and no dot or dotdot entries,
;; completely filling 2, 4, 8, or however many clusters. Then, when we
;; write back this directory, we'll have 3 clusters occupied by this
;; directory, or 5 or 9 or something. The problem is clear.
;;
;; One solution is to return a non-zero error code when a directory is
;; encountered without a dot or dotdot entry in it. Anything else wrecks
;; our guarantees that the transformation from lofat to hifat is
;; reversible. Then, the reasoning will involve the number of clusters
;; taken up for the on-disk representation of a lofat instance. That
;; reasoning will also involve proving that we can allocate upto
;; (count-of-clusters fat32$c) clusters and no more.
;; But, this solution is not perfect - there still remains the problem
;; of clusters being shared across multiple files. So, if cluster 2
;; begins the root directory's clusterchain, and cluster 3 begins a
;; different clusterchain of length 1, then the rest of the clusters
;; could be filled up with directory files in which all the regular
;; file entries point to cluster 3. This would create a filesystem with
;; a huge number of identical files, and after converting it to HiFAT we
;; wouldn't be able to convert it back to LoFAT because of space
;; issues. There's no simple solution to this thing other than insisting
;; that all clusterchains should be disjoint from each other.
;;
;; By the way, what are our guarantees? We assure that a lofat instance
;; which can successfully be transformed to a hifat instance has no more
;; than (max-entry-count fat32$c) directory entries, no
;; duplicate entries in any directory and no directories with more than
;; 2^16 - 2 useful entries. What about directories which blow past 2^16
;; entries altogether? Those will be caught thanks to the error code of
;; get-cc-contents.
