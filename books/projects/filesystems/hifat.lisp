;; It's tempting to remove this predicate, because it makes the fixing of
;; certain functions hard... but it does give us the desirable property of
;; maintaining equality for hifat-entry-count between two directory trees whenever
;; it holds for the two trees. I'm not sure that property is currently used,
;; but it makes a good argument for keeping it. One other argument is the proof
;; of anti-reflexivity for hifat-subsetp - if we are to prove that y is a
;; subset of y under this definition of subsetp (that is, this definition which
;; doesn't do remove-equal), then we need to make sure there are no duplicate
;; bindings for the same filename within a directory. The third argument
;; pertains to the generally understood semantics for filesystems, where there
;; is generally no valid way of dealing with two directory entries referring to
;; the same filename (not the same inode, which is OK in filesystems with hard
;; linking.)
;;
;; In support of this whole thing about ordering of files, there are folks on
;; StackOverflow (https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/227370,
;; https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/227361) and there is this somewhat related
;; snippet from the readdir(3) man page: "The order in which filenames are read
;; by successive calls to  readdir()  depends  on  the filesystem
;; implementation; it is unlikely that the names will be sorted in any

;; We're combining two operations into one here - a different approach would be

;; slash-delimited strings and then for transforming the resulting list
;; element-by-element to a list of fat32 names.
;; This function now necessitates unconditionally using absolute paths every
;; place where its return value is the argument to something else. Perhaps we
;; can have one layer of abstraction for generating the absolute path, but
;; right now we don't have any per-process data structure for storing the
;; current directory, nor are we planning to implement chdir.
