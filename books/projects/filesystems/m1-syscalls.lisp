; return value (corresponding to the C return value) and an errno.

;; This implementation of basename+dirname is not exactly compliant with the
;; man pages basename(3)/dirname(3) - it assumes all paths provided to it are
;; absolute paths (thus, the empty pathname is treated like "/"), and further
;; it expects its argument to be a list of FAT32 names, which means there is
;; not much hope for formulating a particularly coherent relation between this
;; and the friendly command line programs basename(1)/dirname(1).

;; From the common man page basename(3)/dirname(3):
;; --
;; If  path  does  not contain a slash, dirname() returns the string "." while
;; basename() returns a copy of path.  If path is the string  "/",  then  both
;; dirname()  and basename() return the string "/".  If path is a NULL pointer
;; or points to an empty string, then both dirname() and basename() return the
;; string ".".
;; --
;; Of course, an empty list means something went wrong with the parsing code,
;; because even in the case of an empty path string, (list "") should be passed
;; to these functions. Still, we do the default thing, because neither of these
;; functions sets errno.

;; Also, an empty string right in the beginning indicates that the path began
;; with a "/". While not documented properly in the man page, for a path such
;; as "/home" or "/tmp", the dirname will be "/".
