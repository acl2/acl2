RAC: Restricted Algorithmic C
====================================

Documentation
-------------

  RAC is described in Chapter 15 of the book

    Russinoff, D.M., Formal Verification of Floating-Point Hardware Design:
    A Mathematical Approach, Springer, 2018.

Contents of this Directory
--------------------------

This directory contains this README, Makefile, and the following subdirectories:

  src

    Makefile; the parser source files parser.*, output.c, and main.c; and
    rac-skel, which generates the script bin/rac.  Compilation produces some
    other stuff via Flex/Bison.

  bin

    Initially empty.  Compilation produces the rac script and the parser executable.

  lisp

    Makefile and translate.lisp, which converts the output of the parser to
    ACL2 code.  Compilation produces translate.cert.

  include

    rac.h, which must be included in any RAC program, and the Algorithmic C header
    files ac_int.h and ac_fixed.h.

  examples

    Two simple examples of RAC programs, as described in examples/README.
  

Compiling RAC
-------------

  Compilation requires ACL2 and a reasonably recent version of g++ (version
  4.8.1 works fine).

  Edit Makefile so that ACL2 points to the local distribution of ACL2 (where
  the saved_acl2 is to be found) and RAC points to the current directory (which
  is normally the subdirectory books/projects/rac of the ACL2 directory).

  Then,

    make

  After compilation, 'make clean' removes temporary files (lex.yy.c and the like).
  'make veryclean' removes all that was generated, e.g., binaries and ACL2 books.

Structure of a RAC Program
--------------------------

  Every RAC program should contain

    #include <rac.h>

  possibly preceded by one or both of the lines

    #include <ac_int.h>
    #include <ac_fixed.h>

  as needed.  Note that this ordering is critical.

  Every program must also contain the delimiting comments

    // RAC begin

    ...

    // RAC end

  A program may contain any compilable C++ code, but the code between these
  comments, which is the input to the RAC parser, must conform to the RAC
  restrictions.

Parsing, pretty-printing, and translating RAC programs
------------------------------------------------------

  The script bin/rac is invoked in one of the following ways:

    rac prog

      Check prog.cpp for conformance to the RAC subset and programming
      conventions.  This also performs g++ pre-processing, which resolves
      file inclusions, etc., and generates the file prog.i.

    rac -r prog

      Create prog.i, extract the RAC code (between the 'RAC begin' and
      RAC end' delimiters) and pretty-print it. The pretty-printed 
      output is not parsable RAC code, but it looks better on slides and
      in documentation.  Unfortunately, the pretty-printer is not smart
      enough to preserve comments.

    rac -a prog

      Create prog.i, translate the RAC code into a set of ACL2 function
      definitions, and certify the definitions as an ACL2 book.  
      The translation is a two-step process: (1) the parser produces a
      set of S-expressions in the file prog.ast.lisp, and (2) the ACL2
      program translate.lisp converts these to a set of ACL2 functions in
      prog.lisp and certifies that file.  If this process succeeds, the file
      prog.cert is created.  If not, the file prog.acl2.log should provide
      clues to the cause of failure.


Compiling RAC programs for simulation
--------------------------------------

  This should do the trick:
  
    g++ -std=c++14 -I <this directory>/include prog.cpp
