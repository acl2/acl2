; Abstract:
; PLTP(A) fails to prove two theorems in the [THEOREMS] file from 2 September,
; 1973, (Listing I, page 3).  Recall that it is from [THEOREMS] that we have
; constructed the PLTP(A) file we call the ``standard proveall'' in this
; archive.

; The two failures are:

;  [T 8 1 *]::
;  [EQUAL [BINARYOF [PLUS N M]] [BINADD [BINARYOF N] [BINARYOF M]]]

; and

;  [T 8 3]::
;  [EQUAL [LINEAR [CDR [BINARYOF N]]] [HALF N]]

; There is no reason to believe this indicates a difference between PLTP and
; PLTP(A).  These two theorems are not included in the proveall output of 18
; July, 1973 (Listing-J in the archive) even though a proof of the theorem
; between these two, [T 8 2], is included in that output.  But the question
; naturally arises: could some version of PLTP have proved these theorems?  I
; argue in the negative here to that question.

; Some Historical Perspective:

; The following remarks, while meant to clarify the situation, probably do the
; opposite.  The 18 July, 1973, proveall output in Listing-J was not driven
; from same [THEOREMS] file from which we constructed the current
; standard-proveall.lsp.  That [THEOREMS] file dates from 2 September, 1973,
; and may well include theorems that were not in earlier versions of that file.
; Unfortunately, the only snapshot we have of the [THEOREMS] file is the 2
; September, 1973, one, several months after the proof output was listed.

; Furthermore, it was our convention back then to mark with `*' any theorem we
; knew PLTP could not prove and we worked on improving it to find proofs for
; those theorems.  The proveall process could skip theorems marked with `*'
; (see the handling of AVOIDSTAR in the 14 September, 1973, POP-2 source code
; listings-f-and-h.txt).  The 14 September, 1973, version of PLTP in fact
; proves some of the theorems marked with `*' in the 2 September, 1973
; [THEOREMS] file, as evidenced by the fact that those theorems are listed as
; proved in Moore's dissertation and the 1975 JACM paper:

;  [T 6 11 *]::
;  [EQUAL [MEMBER A [SORT B]] [MEMBER A B]]

;  [T 6 13 *]::
;  [EQUAL [COUNT A B] [COUNT A [SORT B]]]

;  [T 6 17 *]::
;  [EQUAL [EQUAL [SORT A] A] [ORDERED A]]

; Random Anectdote: In my oral exam, which included a demonstration of PLTP,
; the committee asked if PLTP had proved that [SORT B] is a permutation of B
; and I replied that it had not, even though I had demonstrated a proof that
; [SORT A] is ORDERED.  The committee then challenged me to try the permutation
; theorem, which we formalized in terms of COUNT and proved for the first time
; in the oral exam.

; It is curious that one of the current failures, [T 8 3] above, does not
; have a `*' in its name.  I cannot explain that and it is one of the reasons
; I undertook the work here.

; The Argument:

; I am convinced that no version of PLTP could prove [T 8 1 *] or [T 8 3].  The
; basic reason is that the only proofs I can think of involve steps that PLTP
; was incapable of taking.  There are two basic difficulties with these
; theorems.

; First, both theorems involve BINADD, a binary addition algorithm.  BINADD is
; used explicitly in (T 8 1 *) and is involved in the definition of BINARYOF,
; which is used explicitly in (T 8 3).  Most problematically, BINADD is defined
; as a ``reflexive function'': when the algorithm needs to carry into a higher
; position it does the addition of the higher bits without carrying and then
; calls itself again on that partial sum and the binary representation of 1.
; No induction that PLTP could do could unwind this recursion adequately.

; Second, both proofs involve the knowledge that BINARYOF returns a well-formed
; binary number, i.e., a list of 1s and 0s.  Such knowledge can only be
; captured in PLTP by its inference of type functions.  But BINADD, which is
; used in the definition of BINARYOF, returns a well-formed binary number only
; if its inputs are well-formed and PLTP could not infer type functions that
; were dependent on the types of the actuals.

; A less principled argument that PLTP could not do these proofs is that ACL2
; cannot prove the ``corresponding'' theorems automatically without help from
; the user.  This is significant since ACL2 is, many senses, our current ``best
; effort'' at improving PLTP!

; This file is actually a certified ACL2 book.  To explore the issues raised in
; these two PLTP proof attempts, I formalize the notion of the
; ``corresponding'' ACL2 theorems, show that ACL2 cannot prove them
; automatically, then guide ACL2 to proofs with a few well-chosen lemmas, and
; and observe that the proofs involve steps beyond those known to PLTP.

; But it is, of course, possible that there is a PLTP-reachable proof that I'm
; not seeing!

; SO I INVITE THE READER OF THIS DOCUMENT TO TRY TO FIND SIMPLER ACL2 PROOFS OF
; THESE EXACT THEOREMS WITH THESE EXACT DEFINITIONS.

; By ``corresponding'' theorems I mean ACL2 formulas and functions that are
; restricted to the PLTP universe of CONS-trees built from NIL.  This universe
; is recognized by pltp-objectp defined below.  I'm willing to stipulate that
; this universe is closed under PLTP functions and to provide that information
; to ACL2 ``for free'' in the sense that I don't expect ACL2 to discover that.
; Each time I introduce the ACL2 correspondent of a PLTP function I will state
; and have ACL2 prove that it stays in the PLTP universe and make that
; available as both a :rewrite rule and a :generalize rule.

; The ACL2 correspondent of a PLTP function definition

; (DEFINE (f (LAMBDA (v1 ... vn) body)))

; will be

; (defun f (v1 ... vn) 
;  (if (and (pltp-objectp v1) ... (pltp-objectp vn))
;      body'
;      '???))

; where body' is the simplified body stored by PLTP(A)'s DEFINE.  This is the
; same body stored by the 1973 PLTP DEFINE for functions in the standard
; proveall since it ``normalates'' the definitions.

; The correspondent of a theorem is just the PLTP formula with the additional
; hypotheses that the variables are pltp-objects (and if the variables are
; ``numeric'' then we also add those hypotheses explicitly).  The closure
; theorems insure that the ??? exits on all the functions are never taken.

; Analysis of (T 8 1 *)

; ACL2 cannot prove the correspondent of this formula automatically but it can
; do so if it knows that BINADD returns a binary number when given two binary
; numbers and that BINARYOF produces a binary number.  If that information is
; required for every proof then there was no way PLTP could have proved this
; theorem because its type inference was context-free: it could not express the
; idea (as a TYPEFN) that the type of a function's output depended on the type
; of its input.

; The induction used on T-8-1-* is ``suggested by (PLTP-OBJECTP N),
; but modified to accommodate (PLUS N M).''  However, the simpler
; induction suggested by (PLUS N M) alone suffices for ACL2, and

; reach of PLTP had it been able to use lemmas!

; PLTP(A) infers the TYPEFN CONSTTRUE, i.e., PLTP(A) can't infer any
; restriction on the output of BINARYOF.  Clearly, given the way
; type-expr works, PLTP would have had to write BINARYP as the TYPEFN
; of BINADD in order to infer it for BINARYOF.  So here's BINADD:

; (DEFINE
;   (BINADD
;    (LAMBDA
;     (X Y)
;     (COND
;      X
;      (COND Y
;            (COND (CAR X)
;                  (COND (CAR Y)
;                        (CONS 0 (BINADD (CONS 1 NIL) (BINADD (CDR X) (CDR Y))))
;                        (CONS 1 (BINADD (CDR X) (CDR Y))))
;                  (CONS (CAR Y) (BINADD (CDR X) (CDR Y))))
;            X)
;      Y))))

; But this function sometimes returns one of arguments, X or Y.  And so the
; ONLY way the output could satisfy BINARYP is if the arguments are.  And PLTP
; had no way to express that idea... unless the definition of BINADD were
; changed somehow to coerce those outputs.  I've tried several versions of BINADD
; and BINARYOF without success.
