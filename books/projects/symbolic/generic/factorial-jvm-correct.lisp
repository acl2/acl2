In this book I show the use of defsimulate to prove the correctness of a
recursive factorial program written in JVM. The JVM model is M5, which has been
developed by Robert Krug, Hanbing Liu, and J Moore at UT Austin. They have
proved various theorems about this model, but mostly using the so-called "clock
functions". J has actually also proved partial correctness theorems using the
method referred to in "Inductive Assertions and Operational Semantics".

;; I need to specify some stuff first before we can get into the situation when
;; we can talk about precondition, postcondition, etc. The first thing is
;; really technical, and might even be considered stupidity on my part. I allow
;; step to take only one argument, namely the current state, in the macro
;; implementation. But M5 programs take two arguments, namely the state and the
;; thread to step. This is because M5 is really a multithraded and
;; non-deterministic model, while our technique affords verification of
;; sequential [deterministic] programs. To reconcile this, I will specify a
;; particular thread for this entire exercise.

;; OK so we are done with this little set of technicalities. Now I want to

;; Assertions and Operational Semantics" book, but modified to be applied to
;; the current method, and in addition, total correctness is proved.

;; The function sdepth here is used to specify the size of the recursion stack
;; which can then be used to indicate whether we are done with the run. In
;; other words I will start the recursive call specifying that the depth of the

;; mechanical. And here I show one. This opener is just specifying to open up
;; the function when the pc is known. Notice that I can also provide the right
;; hints to the macro. Isn't this cool? Of course this is just to show that
;; these facilities exist with the macro in case somebody wants to use
;; them. For this particular program it is possible to avoid both with the
;; right syntaxp hypothesis. But this need not be possible in general, and I
;; like to provide such control in software I write.
