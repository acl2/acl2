(in-package "ACL2")

; This file defines the macro db so that (acl2::db acl2::state) is the
; Paco analogue of the current ACL2 logical world.  This file can only
; be loaded after all the Paco files have been loaded, since it might
; conceptually use any Paco record or data structure.

; Does the ACL2 sometimes contain multiple entries for the same key
; and property?  Yes.  Every :logic mode function in axioms.lisp is
; defined twice, so the properties as ABSOLUTE-EVENT-NUMBER, FORMALS,
; GUARD, STOBJS-IN, STOBJS-OUT, SYMBOL-CLASS, and TYPE-PRESCRIPTIONS
; are all duplicated many times.  In addition, even user-defined
; functions may redefine both SYMBOL-CLASS and TYPE-PRESCRIPTIONS, as
; well as all the properties, e.g., LEMMAS, associated with newly
; added rules.  (Some stats, FYI: The boot strap world contains
; approximately 48K triples.  Of these, approximately 27K have unique
; symbol/property pairs.  There are about 3K symbol/property pairs
; that occur multiple times. It takes about a minute to sweep the
; world and find the duplicate entries in the completely naive way.
; The way we implement it here is about 30 times faster.)

; Seen is an alist pairing symbols with all the properties we have so
; far seen.  We say a trip (sym prop . val) is ``in'' seen if prop is
; an element of the value associated with sym in seen.


; Some ACL2 record accessor forms expand into terms involving the
; :program mode function record-error.  (In particular, the access
; forms for "non-cheap" records.)  This means that the functions that
; copy these records over to the Paco world have to be in :program
; mode.  Rather than make a careful determination of which records
; have this problem, I just do the entire development in :program
; mode.

; Actually, because of the hidden ACL2 effects of these functions,
; this installs the property list created by copy-trips, say paco-w,
; into the Common Lisp world, under the world name paco::paco.  That
; is, if acl2::getprop is ever invoked on paco-w with world name
; paco::paco, the computation goes directly to the Common Lisp

; The PSIM simulator need not do all this.  In an ideal world of
; memoized functions, it would be just as fast for this function just
; to return paco-w and for paco::getprop to be the slow version.

; Note: The only reason this function takes state is so that it can
; pass it to copy-trips.  The only reason copy-trips takes state is so
; that it can get the world out of it to make the call to
; fn-rune-nume.  This function doesn't do anything fancy with state.
