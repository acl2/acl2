; Abstract

; At the highest level, this book implements three basic ideas and then
; implements DEFUNM.  Each is described in a separate Chapter

; * 1: Guessing Measures
;   We use a ``measure patterns'' table to guess measures for recursive
;   functions, including the ability to invent lexicographic combinations a la
;   Boyer-Moore 1979 and a newer facility to assign weights to flags used to
;   control mutually-recursive functions coded as flagged singly-recursive
;   functions.

; * 2:  Learning from User-Supplied Measures
;   We learn from DEFUNs with explicit :measures supplied by the user,
;   extending our measure patterns table by paring down the user's induction
;   machine so that it only mentions those tests necessary to prove the measure
;   conjecture and implementing a notion of subsumption among patterns so that
;   the database is not cluttered with duplications.

; * 3: Generating Non-Recursive Flag Lemmas
;   We support the option of proving automatically generated ``non-recursive
;   flag lemmas'' so that if the admission of a function involves a flag, and
;   one of the flag values just passes the buck to the others -- e.g., one of
;   the functions in the clique is just an eliminable abbreviation for calls on
;   the others -- we generate and prove lemmas that rewrite such non-recursive
;   calls away.

; * 4: DEFUNM
;   We put the three main ideas together in a utility called DEFUNM, which
;   presents itself to the user like DEFUN except it has room after the formals
;   for an :OPTIONS specification.  DEFUNM uses make-event, since it must
;   access state.  DEFUNM becomes DEFUN if the user specifies a measure in the
;   declarations.  Otherwise, it computes the updates to the measure patterns
;   table via the techniques in Chapter 2, then it guesses a measure via
;   Chapter 1, and then, if the :option so specifies it generates any
;   non-recursive flag lemmas available.  It then assembles the results into a
;   PROGN that stores the new measure-patterns, admits the defun with the
;   guessed measure, and proves the flag lemmas.  DEFUNM comes in two flavors,
;   the ordinary one and DEFUNM-NX which introduces non-executable definitions.

; We further discuss each of these four topics in a section each before
; descending into code.  The code is divided into these same three chapters.
; So you will see, for example: ``Chapter 1 (Discussion)'' and ``Chapter 1
; (Code)'' below.  But we do all three discussions before the codes.

; This book has some TODO suggestions in it.

; =================================================================

; Chapter 1 (Discussion): Guessing Measures

;   Chapter Summary: We use a ``measure patterns'' table to guess measures for
;   recursive functions, including the ability to invent lexicographic
;   combinations a la Boyer-Moore 1979 and a newer facility to assign weights
;   to flags used to control mutually-recursive functions coded as flagged
;   singly-recursive functions.

; -----------------------------------------------------------------
; Section: Virtual Formals and Proto Distilled Machines

; A ``virtual formal,'' or ``vformal,'' is a component of a formal, given by an
; expression in that formal.  For example, (nth 7 st) is a virtual formal that
; is changed in a recursion in which st is replaced (update-nth 7 new-val st).
; An important property of virtual formals is that they're orthogonal
; (independent): changing one does not change another.  Thus, if (nth 7 (locals
; st)) and (nth 8 (locals st)) are virtual formals, then (locals s) should not
; be so considered.

; Two tables drive the identification of virtual formals:

; generalized-updater-drivers -- establishes the relation between updaters and
;                                accessors

; constructor-drivers -- establishes the relation between constructors and
;                                accessors

; When attempting to find a measure for a proposed function definition, we work
; in terms of virtual formals.

; Since we cannot easily code vformals positionally, we convert each call to a
; list of ``slot'' expressions, (:SLOT vformal new-val).  We convert a
; termination machine into a ``proto distilled machine,'' or ``pdmach'', in
; order to look for plausible measures.  A proto distilled machine is a list of
; pairs, each pair, (tests . call), corresponding to a line of the termination
; machine except that the call has been replaced by a list of the slots
; changed.  Pdmachs are built by make-proto-distilled-machine .

; By the way, this code exploits the fact that basic ACL2 utilities like
; one-way-unify, subsumption, substitution, etc., ``work'' on such pseudo-terms
; as (:SLOT V (CDR V)) or (NTH I :BASE), e.g., ``terms'' where keywords may
; appear in function or variable symbol positions.

; -----------------------------------------------------------------
; Section: Plausible Measures, Measure Suggestions, and Distilled Machines

; To find plausible measures, we look for patterns in the tests and slots of
; the pdmach.  For example, finding (not (zp (nth 7 st))) among the tests and
; (update-nth 7 (- (nth 7 st) 1) st) among the slots suggests the measure
; (acl2-count (nth 7 st)).  But this heuristic search is based on a database
; of measure-pattern (q.v.) which are record structures that basically list
; tests and/or slots that trigger the suggestion of a given measure.  The list
; of available measure-patterns is stored in a table named measure-patterns,
; initialized in this file.  (It is this table that we extend by noting
; user-supplied :measures, as described once we finish describing how we guess
; measures.)

; The ``match'' process in which we trigger measure patterns based on terms
; that occur in the pdmach, not only generates an allegedly plausible measure,
; it generates a score or ``rank'' for each suggested measure and when multiple
; lines suggest the same measure, their ranks are added.  So the higher the
; rank, the better.

; The function initial-dmach-and-measure-suggestions (q.v.) takes the
; function's termination machine and generates the pdmach.  Then it
; heuristically searches pdmach and generates a list of ranked measure
; suggestions, which it sorts so that the highest ranking measures are listed
; first.  Then it converts the pdmach into a ``distilled machine'' or ``dmach''
; in which we will store a lot of additional information about each line.  It
; then returns the dmach and rank ordered list of suggestions.

; To hold the additional information about each line, we introduce a
; ``distilled line'' or ``dline'' (q.v.).  Each dline is a record that stores
; the tests and slots verbatim from the pdmach, a sublis-expr-style
; substitution pairing vformals with their new values (recapitulating the slots
; but more convenient for some operations), a list (initially empty) of
; validated or ``stamped'' ``measure-suggestion'' (or ``mesug'') as explained
; next, and certain information about the machine's possible use of a ``flag
; vformal'' which we discuss among the subtleties below.

; The measure-suggestions of a dline is list of measure-suggestion (q.v.) or
; ``mesug'' records one for each measure suggested.  Inside the mesug we record
; the ``rank'' of its suggestion (e.g., how often and how well it matched the
; patterns that inspired its suggestion), the measure itself, a ``stamp''
; indicating what we learned (by proof) about the measure on this line, and the
; name of the patterns that suggested this measure.  The stamp is <, <=, or
; POSSIBLY-GROWING.  To stamp a measure suggestion for a given line we generate
; the obvious measure conjecture (the tests of the dline imply the measure
; decreases, either strongly or weakly, under the sublis-expr substitution).
; If we can't prove either strength, we stamp it POSSIBLY-GROWING.

; When we first build the dmach, the list of measure suggestions in each dline
; is empty.  Then, in rank order of the plausible measures, we add stamped
; measures to each dline, by attempting to prove the corresponding measure
; conjecture for each line.

; -----------------------------------------------------------------
; Section: Interleaving Stamping and Finding Lexicographic Measures

; Every time we finish analyzing the behavior of a measure across all of the
; lines, we ask whether we can piece together a lexicographic measure
; explaining the machine.  We try to assemble all possible lexicographic
; measures to eliminate (justify) as many dlines as possible.  The basic idea
; is to find measures that definitely decrease on some line and never increase,
; consider each such measure as the most significant in a lex order, delete all
; the lines from the dmach on which that measure decreases and delete that
; measure from all remaining lines, and recur with the reduced machine.  If we
; can justify all the lines (reach the empty machine), we quit and win with
; that measure.  If not (and ignoring the subtlety below), we repeat -- taking
; the next highest ranking measure, adding its behavior to every line, look for
; lex, etc).

; We fail if we run out of suggestions before we find a lexicographic measure
; explaining all the lines.

; -----------------------------------------------------------------
; Section:  Weighing Flags

; The subtlety mentioned above concerns the possibility that the meachine is
; the flagged encoding of a mutually recursive clique.  This is determined if
; there is a virtual formal that is tested with equality against constants in
; every line and is always either unchanged or changed to a constant.  From
; these constraints we can determine the range (set of constant values) the
; flag may take on, the ``incoming value'' of the flag on each line (possibly a
; subset of the range as happens when the tests identifying the flag are
; negative equalities, i.e., the flag is not 'TERM and thus is either
; 'TERM-LIST or 'COND-EXPR), and the outgoing value of the flag on each line.

; Thus, in addition to each dline containing the tests, the slots, the
; substitution, and a list of stamped measure suggestions, each dline contains
; the flag vformal for the whole machine (or nil if there is none), an alist
; mapping each incoming flag value for the line to the list of all outgoing
; flag values for that line (typically a singleton but could be a set of all
; the flag values not excluded by the foregoing tests), and an alist mapping
; the incoming flag values to the very test used to identify that value on this
; line.

; We don't let the flag vformal, if any, participate in the suggestion of
; measures.  For example, a numerically valued flag, e.g., a program counter,
; might be compared to some fixed upper bound to enforce some good state
; invariant about the pc being in bounds, and could suggest a ``counting up''
; style measure.

; Also, if after we've pieced together a lexicographic measure for as many
; dlines as possible we're still left with some ``unjustified'' lines and those
; lines have a flag vformal, we attempt to assign weights to the incoming flag
; values.  For example, the flag 'TERM transitions to 'TERM-LIST and the flag
; 'TERM-LIST transitions to both 'TERM and 'TERM-LIST, then we assign 'TERM
; value 2 and 'TERM-LIST value 1.

; This completes our sketch Chapter 1.

; =================================================================

; Chapter 2 (Discussion):  Learning from User-Supplied Measures

;   Chapter Summary: We learn from user-supplied DEFUNs with explicit :measures
;   supplied by the user, extending our measure patterns table by paring down
;   the user's induction machine so that it only mentions those tests necessary
;   to prove the measure conjecture and implementing a notion of subsumption
;   among patterns so that the database is not cluttered with duplications.

; We now turn to the problem of updating the measure-patterns database.  The
; idea is that the main way the database will grow is from user-supplied
; DEFUNs with explicit :MEASUREs.  A typical scenario is that the user submits
; a DEFUNM and we fail to generate the right measure.  So the user changes the
; DEFUMN to a DEFUN with an explicit :measure and goes on.  We want the
; measure-patterns table to grow as a result of this user-interaction so that
; DEFUNM will guess the right measure in the future for that ``new'' recursion
; scheme.

; Ideally, DEFUN itself would update the measure pattern table.  But since it is an
; ACL2 system primitive we can't change it.

; Our solution is for DEFUNM to update the table before it starts generating
; suggestions.  It sweeps the world back to the last time the table was updated
; and collects user-supplied measures, analyzes them, and possibly stores
; corresponding measure-patterns in the table.

; This is actually quite complicated because we wish to keep the table small by
; (a) throwing out anything from the induction machine that is not relevant to
; the measure proof, and (b) detecting when an about-to-be-added pattern
; subsumes or is subsumed by an existing pattern.  We deal with updating the
; measure-patterns table only at the end of the development of everything else!

; We pare down the original induction-machine by trying to prove stronger and
; stronger measure lemmas by successively eliminating tests that might be
; irrelevant.  This is not done for the measure conjecture for the entire
; machine but line-by-line, independently.  We actually do this paring down in
; two steps.  First we produce a ``syntactically bare-essentials machine'' --
; with the function syntactically-bare-essentials-machine (q.v.) -- which
; throws out tests based on cliques of variables used.  If a test does not
; involve at least one of the variables used in the measure, it is irrelevant
; (unless the conjunction of the tests is contradictory and the recursion can't
; be taken).  Then, given a syntactically bare machine, we further pare it down
; by successively proving the required measure theorem under fewer and fewer of
; the available hypotheses.  This is done by bare-essential-machine (q.v.).

; Having identified a subset of the available hyps sufficient to prove the
; measure conjecture for the line, we manufacture a measure pattern from it and
; add the pattern to the measure-patterns database.  To add a new pattern to the
; table we check for a style of ``pattern subsumption'' in both directions to
; keep the table subsumption free.  See measure-pattern-subsumes and
; update-measure-patterns.

; By the way, a minor distraction on the way to the latter is the
; implementation of four levels of verbosity in describing the change wrought
; on the table: say nothing or describe deletions, additions, and preservations
; in terms of just the number of such actions, the names of the patterns
; involved, or the patterns themselves.

; =================================================================

; Chapter 3 (Discussion): Adding Non-Recursive Flag Lemmas

;   Chapter Summary: We support the option of proving automatically generated
;   ``non-recursive flag lemmas'' so that if the admission of a function
;   involves a flag, and one of the flag values just passes the buck to the
;   others -- e.g., one of the functions in the clique is just an eliminable
;   abbreviation for calls on the others -- we generate and prove lemmas that
;   rewrite such non-recursive calls away.

; If the distilled machine contains a flag and, whenever that flag is among the
; incoming flag values of a dline it is NOT among the outgoing flag values on
; that same line, then that flag value is ``non-recursive'' (it just passes the
; buck to other flag values).  So we can prove a lemma about a general call on
; that value.  To generate the theorem, we will use simplify-under-hyps (see
; the book of that name).  However, we add such lemmas only if the user
; requests it by including :non-rec-flag-lemma among the DEFUNM :options.

; Complication: Pc=2 may pass the buck to pc=10 which may pass the buck to
; pc=2.  Both appear ``non-recursive.''  But if pc=2 is made into a rule, then
; pc=10 better not be!  Of course, we could make pc=10 a rule instead of pc=2.
; So there is arbitrariness in preferring the first non-recursive flag we find,
; but so be it.

; This completes our general sketch of Terminatricks.  Below you will find code
; sections also demarcated by hyhens and a titles, but at a finer level of
; detail and relying implicitly on the background discussion above.

; Chapter 1 (Code): Guessing Measures

;   Chapter Summary: We use a ``measure patterns'' table to guess measures for
;   recursive functions, including the ability to invent lexicographic
;   combinations a la Boyer-Moore 1979 and a newer facility to assign weights
;   to flags used to control mutually-recursive functions coded as flagged
;   singly-recursive functions.

; This chapter ultimately concludes with the definition of
; stamp-mesugs-and-search

; -----------------------------------------------------------------
; Section:  Call Graph Ordering

; This is a general utility for ordering a set of items according to
; dependency.  Codewalker will use it to process the clock and semantic DEFUNs
; in call graph order.  But Terminatricks also uses it to assign weights to
; flag vformal values.  Suppose we had a mutually recursive clique of 5
; functions numbered 1 through 5 and their calling relationships were: function
; 1 calls function 2, function 2 calls 3, 3 calls 4 and 5, 4 calls 2, and 5
; calls no other functions.  (Calls of a function to itself are not recorded.)
; We could represent this calling graph as:

; ((1 2) (2 3) (3 4 5) (4 2) (5)).

; Then how do we determine the order in which these five functions should be
; defined, or equivalently, what are the relative weights of flag values
; corresponding to these functions?  The answer: compute the reflexive,
; transitive closure of the calls graph to get a ``score'' for each function,
; the score being the reflexive transitive closure of its calls.  Then sort by
; subsetp on their respective scores.

; Instead of numbers, each ``function'' mentioned above is really a pc
; (whatever that is).  We compare them with lexorder.

; More on reflexive-transitive-closure when we get to that function.

; Clearly then, 4 is defined first, then 1, 2, and 3, and last is 5.  But wait!

; Suppose we have two independent functions, say 6 and 7, each of which calls
; the same set of other functions, say (1 2 3 4).  Then are 6 and 7 mutually
; recursive?  No, because the score for 6 would be (1 2 3 4 6) and that for 7
; will be (1 2 3 4 7), they are incomparble, but must be defined after (1 2 3

; Section: Virtual Formals -- Updaters and Constructors and their Accessors and Matching

; Updater drivers are each of the form (updater accessor), where each is a
; translated term except the keywords :value and :base play special roles: the
; first marks the slot where the new value assigned is passed and the second
; marks the slot where the original composite object resides.

(table generalized-updater-drivers
       :list
       '(((update-nth i :value :base) ; everybody uses update-nth/nth
          (nth i :base))
         ((s i :value :base)          ; for those who use the records book
          (g i :base))

         ))

; We treat :base recursively, looking for other updaters.  A nested term like
; (update-nth 1 new-pc (update-nth 3 new-regs st)) generates two virtual
; formals, (nth 1 st) and (nth 3 st).

; These terms need not be flat as they are above.  For example, we might have
; (set-loci i :value :base) with (nth i (locals :base)) as the accessor.  The
; user may set this table arbitrarily within the conventions above.  translated
; modulo the special use of keywords :value and :base.  However, components
; should be orthogonal.

; Similarly:

(table constructor-drivers
       :list
       '(((cons a b)
          (car :base) (cdr :base))))

; For example, the constructor-style definition of M1 would require:

;         (pc :base) (locals :base) (stack :base) (program :base))

; Section: Proto Distilled Machines

; Recall that a termination machine is a list of tests-and-call records.  Each
; tests-and-call (sometimes called a ``line'' of the termination machine) has a
; list of :tests and a single :call of the function in question.  We produce a
; proto distilled machine pdmach (a list of proto distilled lines, pdlines)
; from the termination machine.

; ``Proto dline'' (``pdline'') is just a pair (tests . slots) and a list of
; proto dlines is a ``proto distilled machine'' (``pdmach'').

; We use will pdmach to determine whether a machine is flagged and to suggest
; measures that we will later stamp as strictly decreasing, weakly decreasing,
; or possibly growing on each line.

; However, we want the tests somewhat normalized, e.g., by expanding (ENDP x)
; and sorting into term order.  So our distillation of a termination machine
; into a pdmach is actually rather elaborate:

; (a) ``distill'' the tests -- this makes it possible to see terms like (P x)
; and (Q x) in actual tests like (AND (P A) (NOT (Q A))), which are of course
; coded as IFs in the translated bodies.  Distillation expands nonrecursive
; functions like ENDP to normalize elementary tests around standard usage,
; splits out the propositional structure, and sorts the literals into term
; order.  So given a machine with a line containing the tests ((IF a T b) c)
; and the call d, will become two lines, one with tests (a c) and call d and
; one with tests (b c) and call d.

; (b) replace the call by a list of :SLOT pseudo-terms -- this allows a
; subsumption-like computation to find the permutations of the formals in
; patterns that match the actuals instead of having to permute the order of the
; actuals.

; (c) introduce virtual formals when dealing with termination machines -- this
; allows us to suggest measures for decreasing components of larger formals
; using measure patterns derived from simpler earlier definitions.  For
; example, the measure pattern derived from a simple definition like factorial
; -- which suggests measuring the formal N with ACL2-COUNT and triggering on
; (:SLOT N (- N 1)) -- will apply to a state-modifying function with a virtual
; slot like: (:SLOT (NTH 7 (NTH 1 S)) (- (NTH 7 (NTH 1 S)) 1)).  Note that we
; DO NOT INTRODUCE VIRTUAL FORMALS when dealing with induction machines -- yet
; -- because we want the slots in patterns to bind variables.  See the
; discussion of slots in the defrec for measure-patterns.

; (d) Finally, we drop any unchanging actuals -- this means our treatment of
; formals is the same as our treatment of virtual formals in this respect.
; But the absence of any slots doesn't signal a base case!

; We call this ``distilling'' the lines and the machine.  The lines in
; distilled machines are simply pairs, (tests . slots), sometimes called
; ``dlines,'' where tests are literals, implicitly conjoined and representing
; some branch through the original propositional structure of the :tests in a
; line of a t-machine leading to a call and slots are the changing (sometimes
; virtual) formals-to-actuals in their corresponding :SLOT pseudo-terms
; notation.  If a dline contains no slots it means that it calls itself with
; all the arguments unchanged.  (This, of course, would make the function
; inadmissible if the corresponding tests aren't contradictory, but that's
; beside the point!)  The point is: a dline with no slots means a recursive
; call!  It does not mean a base case!

; The hard step here is splitting out the tests.  We build the IF expression
; representing (IMPLIES (AND . tests) concl) where concl is some new variable.
; When then clausify it, collect just the clauses whose last literal is concl,
; delete concl from those clauses, and negate every literal in each clause.
; The result is a disjunction of implicitly conjoined tests.  E.g.,
; here is the IF-form of (implies (and (or A B) C) CONCL), clausified:

; (clausify '(IF (IF (IF A 'T B) C 'NIL) CONCL 'T) nil nil nil)
; (((NOT A) (NOT C) CONCL)
;  ((NOT B) (NOT C) CONCL))
; ==> {collect and strip clauses with CONCL}
; (((NOT A) (NOT C))
;  ((NOT B) (NOT C)))
; ==> {dumb-negate-lit each clause}
; ((A C)
;  (B C))

; Logically:
; (IMPLIES (AND (OR A B) C) CONCL)
; <-->
; (AND (IMPLIES (AND A C) CONCL) (IMPLIES (AND B C) CONCL))

; Clearly, CONCL stands for the measure inequality, but we don't need to be
; concerned with its details here.

; Section:  Measure Patterns and Measure Suggestions

; A measure-pattern indicates that the presence of certain tests and slots
; suggests a certain measure.  Patterns are a little fancier and we'll declare
; and document the record below when we start to use them.  Patterns, when
; applied to pdlines and pdmachs suggest measures.  However, it is not
; necessary for a pattern to match perfectly to suggest a measure.  For
; example, a pattern may indicate that a certain test and a certain slot
; configuration suggest a measure but when applied the test is not found but
; the slot is.  The suggestion is made anyway, but will have a lower rank than
; one that fit the pattern better.

; Suggestions are recorded in measure-suggestion (mesug) records:

; Note:  The following record must be cheap, so

; (access measure-suggestion mesug :rank) = (car mesug)
; (access measure-suggestion mesug :measure) = (cadr mesug)

; Given a list of measure-suggestions we sort it by comparing cars (i.e.,
; :ranks) and sometimes seach with assoc-equal-cadr (i.e., for :measure).

(defrec measure-suggestion    ; ``mesug''
  (rank measure stamp names)
  t)                          ; CHEAP!  See note above.

; Our basic plan is to look at each (tests . slots) pair in a proto distilled
; machine and fire all the measure-patterns to collect all the mesugs
; applicable to any pdline in the machine.  Then we'll ascertain the actual
; behavior of each measure on each line (whether suggested by that line or not)
; by attempting to prove the obvious conjectures.

; Our immediate goal is to apply a measure pattern mp to a pdline pair and
; compute a list of alists with the property that when one of the alists is
; used to instantiate the pattern's :tests and :slots there is a non-empty
; intersection with the pdline's tests and slots.

; Since it is possible for the same (set-equal) alist to be generated by

; pairs have set-equal alists, we keep the one with the higher s-score.

; Name is any symbol and is just used to identify the name of this heuristic.

; Measure is the measure term being suggested.

; Vars is the list of variable symbols occuring freely in measure.

; Tests is the list of tests suggesting this measure.  Note: It is possible for
; a distilled test to mention a variable not occurring in the measure, as would
; happen if the user's definition had tested (MEMBER E X) and relied on it to
; insure (CONSP X).

; Slots is the list of changing slots suggesting this measure.  Note: Each
; element of slots is (:SLOT formal actual) where formal is a variable symbol,
; not a virtual formal.  A slot is allowed (by our code) to use a formal not
; occurring in measure.  But in fact we suspect that all the patterns we or the
; user will generate will only mention changing formals involved in the measure
; so as not to weaken the applicability of the suggestion.

; Invariants is a list of pseudo-terms expressing a conjunction of restrictions
; on legal instantiations of the variables in tests and slots.  Each element
; must be a cons and the car (``function symbol'') of each must be a KEYWORD
; other than :measure and :slot.  These pseudo-terms are not actually evaluated
; properly, they are interpreted by a special-purpose invariant checker with
; respect to the substitution alist produced by matching the :tests and :slots.
; But they must obey the rules of pseudo-terms because they are subjected to
; subsumption.  The allowed invariant pseudo-terms and their meanings with
; respect to a substitution alist are:

; (:constant ':negint v) - v is bound in alist to a quoted negative integer
; (:constant ':posint v) - v is bound in alist to a quoted positive integer

; The restrictions on invariants insure that we can do a subsumption check on
; them (by just appending them into the pseudo-clause for the measure pattern,
; see pseudo-clause-of-measure-pattern) without them being mixed up with tests
; (which are true terms), measures, or slots.

; See the code immediately below for how we check the syntax and meaning of
; invariants wrt the substitution alist, and how the user might extend the
; allowed invariants.

; Pseudo-clause is just a list containing the measure, all the tests, all the
; slots, and all the invariants.  The measure ``literal'' is tagged with
; :measure.  This ``clause'' has no logical meaning.  Its only role is to allow
; us to check, via a simple conventional clause subsumption check, that the
; measure, tests, slots, and invariants of one mp subsume those of another.
; This test is used when adding a new mp to the database.  Each ``clause'' only
; has one :measure ``literal'' and so measures are only subsumed by measures.
; Similarly for the ``literals'' from the invariants, thanks to the minimal
; syntactic checks in mp-invariantsp.  Slots are interchangeable with other
; slots modulo substitution but cannot be subsumed by any other part of the
; pattern.  And tests are proper terms and are the only proper terms in the
; ``clause'' and so they don't mix with measures, slots, or invariants.

; It may seem counterintuitive that subsumption ever fires if we have
; ``maximally'' cleaned up our machines as we do with bare-essential-machine
; below.  But ``maximal'' is relative to the resource limits and, more
; importantly, to the lemma development that may put certain results within
; reach that were not in reach before.  I give an example of subsumption
; actually firing among my tests below.  See the examples around the defun of
; overly-complicated and less-complicated below.

; different function.  Of course, any function attached to chk-mp-invariantsp
; must be guard-verified with the same (or weaker) guard.  The only thing we

; somewhat unpredictable behavior regarding when one measure-pattern subsumes
; another.

; Section: Applying Measure Patterns to Suggest Measures

; TODO: We could try to weed out bogus suggestions.  Here's what I mean: We
; currently ignore the actual hyps in the theorem that would justify a measure
; suggestion.  For example, in the first suggestion below, we don't insist that
; (natp i) be present in the (equal i 0) case.  In the 1979 book, we actually
; used the rewriter to prove that the governing tests imply the hyps of the
; relevant lemma.  If that was proved, we KNEW the measure decreased (possibly
; only weakly) in that call.  We then tried to assemble a lexicographic
; combination out of the things we knew, and if we succeeded, we declared
; victory.

; In ACL2, we are going to prove the measure conjecture, come what may.  So
; there is no point in proving that the tests imply the hypotheses... unless it
; turns out that it is faster to do that to rule out bogus suggestions before
; resorting to a full-blown admissions check.

; Alist is a substitution for instantiating the measure pattern mp.  The alist
; instance of the measure in mp has been suggested by pdline.

; We compute the rank of the suggestion as an integer between 1 and 100.  We sum
; the number of :slots it picks up (weighing changing slots by a factor of 2)
; and the number of :tests it picks up, then we normalize that so the highest
; score is 100.

; Note that the score can be arbitrarily close to 100 (including a ``perfect''
; 100) even when NONE of the slots are matched!  We give an example below.
; It is relevant because we have considered imposing a restriction in which we
; throw out suggestions that do not stem from at least one matched slot and one
; way to do that would be to use a threshold formula that detects that condition.
; But this is not such a formula!

; For example, if there was only 1 :slot in the pattern and it was not matched,
; but there were 199 tests (!)  and they all matched, the relevant computation
; would be (ceiling (* 100 (/ (+ 0 199) (+ 2 199))) 1) = (ceiling 99.004 1) =
; 100 (This is the minimal number of tests that produces a perfect 100.)  On
; the other hand, if we used FLOOR instead of CEILING we'd reserve 100 for the
; case where all of the slots matched too.  But that doesn't really solve the
; thresholding problem because, even with FLOOR and a realistic scenario, like
; 1 :slot which is not matched with 3 tests which are all matched we would get
; quite respectable rank of 60 and ranks can still reach 99 with enough tests.

; Warning: If you change the 100 to something else, be sure to look for other
; occurrences of 100 in this book.  There are no others as of February 13,
; 2014.

; Section:  A Resource Limited Version of THM

; We implement a limited form of memoization below.  While the function
; resource-limited-thmp takes state, we do not memoize it and do not intend to
; pass the memo alist over changes to state.

; We sometimes expect memoization to pay off and sometimes not to.  So if the
; memo-alist arg is t it means don't use memoization; otherwise the memo-alist
; is exactly what you'd expect: an alist associating tuples of all the
; arguments (except state) with the value last computed.  We use memoization
; when we stamp measure suggestions; see stamp-mesug-for-dline.  We do not use
; memoization when we are computing the ``bare machine;'' see the description
; of the algorithm in the comment above bare-essential-hyps.

; By the way, anything called a ``termemo'' (``Terminatricks memo'') is a pair,
; (ans . memo-alist) where ans is the value the user wanted computed and
; memo-alist is just an updated memo-alist as manufactured and checked by
; resource-limited-thmp.

; Section:  Weighing Flags

; Before we can carry out step (b) described above -- the search for a winning
; lexicographic measure -- we must describe how we assign weights to flags.
; Here's why and then how.

; When we build up a lexicographic measure we accumulate the winning sequence
; of mesugs in reverse order.  If we win, we'll make a LLIST term out of their
; :measures.  The name of our accumulator is rev-lex-mesug-lst.  Also, when we
; search for the lexicographic measure we gradually eliminate dlines from the
; dmach, relying on suggested measures that decrease, until we have no more
; mesugs that decrease.  Then we try to assign weights to the flag, if any, to
; explain the remaining dlines.

; Suppose that flag value a transitions (in the reduced dmach) to flag value b,
; b goes to c and d, and c goes to e.  Then call-graph-ordering tells us that c
; must be defined first, then b, then a.  Another way to look at it is that a
; must be heavier than b, b heavier than c and d, and c heavier than e.  We
; therefore build a measure like this:

; value  wt
; c      2
; b      3
; a      4
; others 1

; Section:  Putting Together a Lexicographic Measure

; Now we do step (b) described above: we try to piece together a decreasing
; lexicographic measure for a dmach.  We actually accumulate a list of measure
; terms rev-lex-measure-lst, such that when listed in reverse order and put
; together with LLIST they constitute a decreasing lexicographic measure.
; (`Rev-Lex-Measure-Lst' stands for ``reversed lexicograph measure list.'')

; The basic idea is to find a measure that definitely decreases in at least one
; dline and is definitely non-increasing in all the others.  We do this by
; counting, for each measure mentioned in the dmach, the number of dlines the
; stamp is <, aborting with a ``count'' of nil if we find a stamp of
; possibly-growing.  For each such sometimes decreasing and never increasing
; measure, we recur after (a) adding the measure to our evolving
; rev-lex-measure-lst, (b) deleting from dmach the dlines on which the measure
; definitely decreases, and (c) deleting the corresponding mesugs from all
; surviving dlines.  If we reach the empty machine, rev-lex-measure-lst
; identifies a decreasing lexicographic measure.  If we reach a machine with no
; sometimes decreasing measures, we use the flag analysis above to try to
; explain the remaining lines.  If so, we add it to the list and win.  If not,
; we lose.  The function that implements this algorithm is defined at the end
; of this section and is named find-rev-lex-measure-lst-dmach .

; first dline.

; Chapter 2 (Code):  Learning from User-Supplied Measures

;   Chapter Summary: We learn from user-supplied DEFUNs with explicit :measures
;   supplied by the user, extending our measure patterns table by paring down
;   the user's induction machine so that it only mentions those tests necessary
;   to prove the measure conjecture and implementing a notion of subsumption
;   among patterns so that the database is not cluttered with duplications.

; We recommend re-reading the introductory discussion of this topic, which may
; be found above under Chapter 2 (Discussion).

; This chapter ultimately concludes with the definitions of
; add-measure-patterns-to-data-base and slightly later update-measure-patterns.
; The former adds new patterns to a list of known patterns and the latter
; actually does that, describes the changes, and installs the result as the new
; table.

; -----------------------------------------------------------------
; Section:  Identifying User-Provided Measures

; It is necessary to distinguish user-supplied measures from ones guessed by
; DEFUNM.  Thus, there are basically three kinds of DEFUN:  those where no :measure
; was supplied and is thus ACL2-COUNT of the first argument tested and changed on every
; recursion, those in which an explicit :measure is supplied by the user, and those
; in which an explicit measure is supplied by DEFUNM.

; So we use the following identity macro for marking defun events generated by
; successful DEFUNM events.  DEFUNM wraps its guessed measure in this macro.
; The macro call is preserved in the event-landmark laid down, but is
; eliminated in all the logical work, including the JUSTIFICATION records.  If
; we made this symbol an identity function it would start to build up in
; learned measures as in (defunm-marker (defunm-marker (acl2-count x))).

(defmacro DEFUNM-MARKER (x) x)

; The following code is in support of measure-hint-in-defunp, which determines
; whether an event form is a DEFUN with an explicit :MEASURE.  When we find an
; explicit :MEASURE we indicate whether it was generated by DEFUNM or the user,
; keying on the presence of the DEFUNM-MARKER identity function as the
; top-level function symbol of the measure.

(defun measure-hint-in-xargs (x)
  (cond ((atom x) nil)
        ((eq (car x) :measure)
         (if (and (consp (cdr x))
                  (consp (cadr x))

; Section:  Collecting the Defuns from which Patterns are Built

; A successful DEFUNM may execute a TABLE event updating the measure-patterns
; table followed chronologically by a DEFUN.  (It may also prove some
; non-recursive flag lemmas as discussed in Chapter 3.)  Any DEFUN event
; generated by DEFUNM is marked as such by the presence of the DEFUNM-MARKER
; identity macro at the outermost function symbol in the measure.  In the
; update phase, we will scan the world from :here to the last time the
; measure-pattern table was updated or until the last time a DEFUNM was done,
; and collect any intervening DEFUN events with :MEASUREs.

; A subtlety in this design is that a successful DEFUNM generates a DEFUN event
; with a :MEASURE hint.  Do we collect that last DEFUNM?  Can we learn anything
; from a successful DEFUN we generated from the measure-patterns?  Yes!

; To discuss this more precisely, let's give names to the relevant commands and
; events.  Suppose we are trying to execute a DEFUNM command, cmd1, which will
; in fact first execute a TABLE event, tbl1, to update the measure-patterns,
; and then, after speculatively trying the suggested measures, will execute a
; successful (and DEFUNM-MARKER marked) DEFUN event, def1.  In the first phase
; of the DEFUMN processing, it will scan the world from :here to the last
; measure-patterns TABLE event or the last DEFUNM event (even if it did not
; generate a TABLE event because nothing new was learned).  Let the earlier
; DEFUMN command be cmd0 with event def0 (with or without a chronologically
; preceding table event).  The measure used for def0 was generated after
; checking and possibly updating the table.  Let the table that generated
; def0's measure be tbl0.  That table might be further updated in light of the
; success of def0.

; Here is how.  Suppose tbl0 contains an unnecessarily complicated
; measure-pattern, say with many extra :tests, because it was suggested by a
; function with lots of case analysis in it.  Suppose def0 is much simpler, say
; fewer tests, but was explained by the same measure and was generated because
; the complicated pattern suggested the measure.  That suggestion might have
; had a low rank since def0 did not have all the (unnecessary) tests in the
; tbl0 pattern.  If cmd1 incrementally updates the table with tbl1 it will
; compare the measure-pattern implied by def0 with the measure-pattern in tbl0
; and could replace that overly complicated pattern with a simpler one.  That
; means subsequent suggestions of that measure will have higher rank.

; It is thus worthwhile to collect not just intervening user DEFUNs with
; explicit :measures but to also collect the function introduced by the most
; recent DEFUNM.

; Section: Constructing Measure Patterns from Admitted Defuns

; Having identified the function symbols we wish to consider, we now turn to
; the question of deriving measure-patterns (if any) from the successful
; admission of a fn.  The idea is to derive a pattern from every call in the
; induction-machine, suggesting the measure in the justification of the
; function.  We only do this for NATP valued measures with
; well-founded-relation o<.  Note that this means the relation is always <.
; (Since we never learn from lexicographic measures, we never see a line where
; the operative measure merely stays fixed or weakly decreases.)

; Remember that an induction machine is a list of tests-and-calls -- not
; tests-and-CALL -- and that some of the :calls fields are nil, indicating base
; cases.  Some key problems in generating patterns from induction machines are
; that the tests may involve IF-expressions (e.g., the IF-form of (OR a b))
; causing splits and some tests are not necessary for termination (e.g., the
; (EQUAL E (CAR X)) in the definition of (MEM E X).  If we allow these
; overly-complicated tests to generate measure patterns, we get a lot of bogus
; and impractical patterns.

; TODO: We may eventually need to handle virtual formals here.  But at the
; moment we limit ourselves just to formals.

; Here is a sketch of the main steps.

;  (0) Convert the induction-machine into a syntactically bare essentials
;  machine consisting entirely of pairs (tests . subst), where tests are the
;  syntactically relevant distilled tests governing some call and subst is the
;  relevant components of the formals-to-actuals substitution for that call.

;  (1) For each pair in the syntactically bare essentials machine, discard any
;  pair for which the requisite measure theorem cannot be proved (within our
;  resource bounds) and then eliminate any unnecessary tests.  The result is a
;  bare-essentials-machine.

;  (2) For each pair in the bare essentials machine, create a measure pattern.

; We now implement each of these steps, in separate sections.

; -----------------------------------------------------------------
; Section:  Syntactically Bare Essential Machine

;  (0) Convert the induction-machine into a syntactically bare essentials
;  machine consisting entirely of pairs (tests . subst), where tests are the
;  syntactically relevant distilled tests governing some call and subst is the
;  relevant components of the formals-to-actuals substitution for that call.

; Thus, each pair of the syntactically bare essentials machine concerns one
; call and only the tested literals needed for that one call.

; The tests are implicitly conjoined, free of all propositional connectives
; (other than NOT), and syntactically minimal (i.e., only mention vars somehow
; relevant to the concluding measure inequality) for that call, and listed in
; ascending term order.

; The idea is to pare down the tests and substitution to bare essentials by
; syntactic criteria only.  By getting rid of propositional connectives (like
; OR) and splitting out the cases, we can make patterns that are more likely to
; fire on -- and only on -- essential conditions.

; For example, if the measure is (m x) and the call maps formals (x y z) to (+
; x y), y', and z', and the tests are (p x), (q y), (r x y), (a z), then we
; return the pair containing tests ((p x) (q y) (r x y)) and the substitution
; ((x . (+ x y))).  The y and z pairs are discarded from the substitution
; because they are not important to the measure or the measure theorem.  The
; test (a z) is discarded because it is not relevant.  But the test (q y) is
; kept because it is linked to x by (r x y), which is also kept.

; First we develop a way to partition the tests according to the variables
; they somehow use.

; Given a set of terms, tests, we build a partitioning of the tests in which
; each partition contains all the tests that share a set of variables.  Thus,
; if (P x), (Q y), and (R x y) are among the tests, they end up in the same
; partition, whereas (A u), (B v), and (C z) each end up in separate
; partitions.  We return a set of pairs, each pair being (vars' . tests') where
; vars' is some subset of the variables occurring in tests and tests' are all
; the variables somehow mentioning vars'.  The tests' form a partitioning of
; the tests (and the vars' form a partitioning of the variables in the tests).

; partitioning of all the variables in the problem.  Loosely put, each pair
; contains an independent clique of variables and all the tests somehow
; involving just those variables.  We collect all the tests somehow involving
; any variable in vars.

  (cond ((endp vars) nil)

; Section:  Semantically Essential Machines

; The crux of the idea is identifying the semantically essential hypotheses as
; efficiently as we can.

; The algorithm below takes a set of hyps and a concl, and -- providing hyps
; and concl satisfy a certain ill-defined ``prime mover'' condition -- returns
; either nil or a smallest subset of the hyps that provably implies concl with
; given resource constraints.  The ``prime mover'' condition means that there
; is a unique subset of hyps that implies concl.  If this is not true, the
; algorithm may not find the smallest such subset.  The algorithm works in
; log-time assuming the proof attempts occur in constant time.  It is based on
; the following theoretically valid assumption that does not actually hold in
; practice: If hyps' is a subset of hyps and (hyps --> concl) cannot be proved,
; then (hyps' --> concl) cannot be proved.  The practical fly in this
; theoretical ointment is that an irrelevant hyp might send the prover into a
; black hole and cause it to exhaust the resource bounds, while the elimination
; of that irrelevant hypothesis eliminates the gateway into the black hole and
; will produce an easily provable theorem.  We just hope that doesn't happen
; often!

; The algorithm accurately identifies a subset of hyps that provably implies
; concl within the resource bounds, but if the prime mover condition is
; violated or some hyp is a black hole for the prover the algorithm may not
; return the smallest such subset.

; The algorithm:

; If hyps --> concl cannot be proved, fail.  Else, try each of the immediate
; subsets (the subsets obtained by deleting exactly one element) of hyps.  If
; they all fail, then hyps is a smallest subset.  If one of them succeeds with
; answer hyps', then hyps' is a smallest subset.

; Note that since we're potentially trying all subsets of the hyps, there's no
; reason to use memoization on the calls to resource-limited-thmp: every call
; is on a different formula.

; In earlier versions of this, we enumerated all subsets of the hyps and tried
; each -- an exponential time algorithm.  Of course, if the winning subset
; happens to occur early in the enumeration, the exponential method will beat
; the log-time one.

; On the prime mover condition: Suppose hyps is (A B C) and concl is D and
; suppose that both (A --> D) and (B & C) --> D, but neither B nor C alone
; implies D.  Depending on the order in which things are tried, the algorithm
; might identify (B C) as the ``smallest'' adequate subset, even though (A) is
; smaller.  The reason is that when it drops A it can prove ((B&C)-->D) and
; nothing smaller for that subset.

; We could remove the condition by continuing to search after finding a
; smallest subset.  For example, if after identifying (B C) as a smallest
; subset it nevertheless tried (A B) and/or (A C), it would then discover that
; (A) was adequate.  Then we could choose between (A) and (B C).

; One way the prime mover condition could be violated is if (A --> (B&C)).  For
; example, let A be (CONSP x), B be (TRUE-LISTP x), and C be (NOT (EQUAL x
; NIL)).  This situation probably doesn't arise much in practice because in
; practice the hyps are all tests explicitly written by the user in a function
; definition and users almost never intentionally write an IF that tests a
; condition already known to be true.  (An exception to this rule: situations
; where MBT is used.)

; But ((A X) & (B Y) & (C Z)) --> ((A X) v ((B Y) & (C Z))) is an example of
; three completely independent hypotheses that lead to two adequate and
; irreducible subsets, one of which is smaller than the other.  I only chose a
; first order example (instead of the propositional root of the example (a & b)
; --> (a v b)) because our applications all involve variables and by choosing
; distinct variables we make it clear that the hypotheses are independent.

; However, I suspect that in our situation, the prime mover condition almost
; always holds: there is one reason the tests imply that the measure decreases.

; TODO: A clearly superior way would be to first see if certain known
; conditions are met, e.g., see if the implication is subsumed by

; (not (zp x)) --> (< (acl2-count (- x 1)) (acl2-count x))

; and if so pick out just the relevant instance of (not (zp x)).  The idea
; would then be to use a few smart heuristics to eliminate the bulk of the
; common cases and then the log-time approach in general.  If it is thought
; that the singleton hyps case is common, we could try all of singleton hyps
; before the log-time approach, and modify the log-time approach so as not to
; do any singletons.

; TODO: Explore the possibility that the prime mover condition is violated,
; by doing the search above.

; TODO: Consider step-count propagation: One could make the full search
; slightly less inefficient by reducing the resources available.  For example,
; returning to the ((A & B & C) --> D) example above, if (B&C) --> D is
; provable in k steps, as reported by (last-prover-steps state), then one could
; limit the attempts at (B --> D) and (C --> D) to k steps.  Furthermore, after
; identifying (B C) as an adequate subset, one could limit (A & B) --> D and (A
; & C) --> D to k steps as well.

; We should pursue these after getting the rest to work!

; Section:  Adding Measure Patterns to the Database

; Aside:  Our basic design of DEFUNM calls for computing the new list of measure
; patterns, using it to justify the current DEFUNM event, and then installing
; the new patterns in the measure-patterns table.  Thus, our comments are really
; concerned with adding new measure patterns to a list of other measure patterns
; (that will eventually become the database).

; Next we consider how to determine whether we should replace one measure
; pattern by another.  Under what conditions is one mp better than another?  We
; say that measure pattern mp1 ``subsumes'' measure pattern mp2 iff the
; pseudo-clause of mp1 subsumes that of mp2.

; Note that if the pseudo-clause of mp1 subsumes that of mp2, then there is a
; substitution s such that when applied to the pseudo-clause of mp1 produces a
; pseudo-clause that is a subset of that of mp2.  Ignoring the substitution for
; a moment, this means that the measures of the two patterns are the same, all
; the :slots of mp1 are found among the :slots of mp2 (mp2 may have more
; :slots), all the :tests of mp1 are found among the :tests of mp2 (mp2 may
; have more tests), and all the invariant tuples of mp1 are found among those
; of mp2 (mp2 may have more and invariants are conjoined).  In the most common
; case, the substitution will be variable-to-variable and subsumption just
; checks for variance.  But given that we do full-blown subsumption, we allow
; mp1 to be strictly more general than mp2.

(defun measure-pattern-subsumes (mp1 mp2)

            (access measure-pattern mp2 :pseudo-clause)
            nil))

; However, replacement of mp2 in the database by mp1 just because mp1 subsumes
; mp2 is a little misguided.  Note that ((consp x) (consp y)) subsumes ((consp
; z)).  We define a function below that attempts to determine which, if either,
; of two mps is better.

; Chapter 3 (Code): Adding Non-Recursive Flag Lemmas

;   Chapter Summary: We support the option of proving automatically generated
;   ``non-recursive flag lemmas'' so that if the admission of a function
;   involves a flag, and one of the flag values just passes the buck to the
;   others -- e.g., one of the functions in the clique is just an eliminable
;   abbreviation for calls on the others -- we generate and prove lemmas that
;   rewrite such non-recursive calls away.

; We recommend re-reading the introductory discussion of this topic, which may
; be found above under Chapter 3 (Discussion).

; This chapter ultimately concludes with the definition of
; make-non-recursive-flag-rule-lst.

; Chapter 4:  DEFUNM

;   Chapter Summary: We put the three main ideas together in a utility called
;   DEFUNM, which presents itself to the user like DEFUN except it has room
;   after the formals for an :OPTIONS specification.  DEFUNM uses make-event,
;   since it must access state.  DEFUNM becomes DEFUN if the user specifies a
;   measure in the declarations.  Otherwise, it computes the updates to the
;   measure patterns table via the techniques in Chapter 2, then it guesses a
;   measure via Chapter 1, and then, if the :option so specifies it generates
;   any non-recursive flag lemmas available.  It then assembles the results
;   into a PROGN that stores the new measure-patterns, admits the defun with
;   the guessed measure, and proves the flag lemmas.  DEFUNM comes in two
;   flavors, the ordinary one and DEFUNM-NX which introduces non-executable
;   definitions.

; This executes form and then rolls the world (and most system state globals)

; Essay on Eliminating Isolated Tests

; On 30 Jan, 2014, I wrote to Matt Kaufmann asking if he could settle the
; conjecture below.  I had spent some frustrating time thinking about it and
; decided I'd rather get on with coding Terminatricks than justifying the
; idea.

;    Let's say a formal parameter, A, of a function defun of
;    FN is ``isolated'' if it is never used in a tested
;    (actually, ruling) expression and the only occurrences
;    of A in recursive calls are in the A-slot.

;    Typical isolated parameter are ``pure accumulators''
;    like the Y in (REV-APPEND X Y) and ACC in
;    (MERGE-LEXORDER X Y ACC).  Of course, not all
;    accumulators are isolated, e.g., IGNORED-SEEN in
;    LEGAL-LET*-P is tested.

;    Conjecture: If a defun of FN is admissible and FN has
;    an isolated parameter A, then there exists a measure
;    for FN that does not include A.  (I.e., A need not be
;    in the measured subset.)

;    Intuitively, this seems true to me because A can't
;    affect the termination if it is never tested.  But the
;    obvious way to prove it would be to say that if you
;    have a proof for some measure that involves A you can
;    prove it for a measure that doesn't involve A.  But I
;    don't see how to define such a measure if I don't know
;    anything about the successful measure other than that it
;    decreases in a well-founded ordering.

; I also said I'd be happy with a proof for the simple case illustrated by

; (defun fn (x a)
;   (declare (xargs :measure (m x a)))
;   (if (test x)
;       (fn (d x) (g x a))
;       a))

; where (m x a) is a natural.

; Matt replied soon after: ``Interesting question!'' and then provided the
; following script proving the Conjecture for the simple case requested.  I
; have edited his script to make the names more intuitive to me.
