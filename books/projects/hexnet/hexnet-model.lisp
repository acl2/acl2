; Modeling HexNet in ACL2

; This file depicts the current model of HexNet in ACL2.  This is an
; attempt to capture HexNet functionality using the ACL2 modeling
; system.  However, this model does not demonstrate asynchrony in
; packet movement; instead, it is the first step in modeling
; acceptable HexNet behaviours of the network as a whole.  We have
; represented the network as a graph spread on a Cartesian grid.  The
; nodes in the graph represent the junctions in the network.  Each
; junction is named by a pair indicating its X- and Y- coordinates.
; The edges of the graph are the links between the junctions.

; We start by defining the syntax of the network, its junctions, and
; links.  Then, we define the syntax of packets, which are the data
; items in the HexNet network.  Having defined this notion, we then
; define a state of the system, which we call a "Linktable".  The
; Linktable contains the location of all packets in the network after
; each ``step'' of the system.  Then, we define functions that update
; the state, "Linktable", and then conclude with the definition of the
; run function of the system.

;; The routing function caluclates the next direction of a packet or

;; function decides the packet direction by comparing the current
;; junction address with the final destination address and then picks
;; the possible next junction that is closest to the final address.

;; In the graph above, PKT1 is entering junction (4 . 2). The packet can
;; either go through junction (6 . 2) or (4 . 0) after leaving (4 . 2)
;; based on the final destination address in it.  For instance, if the
;; final destination address in the packet is (8 . 3), then the
;; function comapres (4 . 2), the current address and (8 . 3), the final
;; destination. Thereafter, the function makes a choice between the
;; possible next junctions, (6 . 2) and (4 . 0) based on which is closer
;; to (8 . 3).

;; Past - The junction from which the packet is leaving
;; Curr - The junction to which the packet is entering
;; Final - The final destination to which the packet is to be delivered
;; Dests - The list of possible next junctions that could be on the
;;         path to the final destination.

;; Since packets are stored on the links, the link table depicts the
;; state of the system by showing where the packets are located at a
;; given time.  Therefore, to model packet movement, we update the
;; linktable as long as some packet can move.

;; Algorithm:

;;  * Check if the receiving link (outlink) is empty.  If full, no
;;  * update is made.

;;  * Otherwise, the arbiter gives a chosen input link.  Check if the
;;    packet on the input link is valid

;;  * If the packet is valid, the routing function calculates and
;;    returns the packet's next ``turn_signal'' direction.

;;  * If the ``turn_signal'' is valid, repack the packet and update
;;    the linktable by adding it to output link.  Then, update the
;;    linktable to remove the old packet from the input link.

;;  * Otherwise, make no changes to the linktable.

;; only when one (or more) of their their input links are full.
;; Therefore, before the system may take a step, we do a preprocessing

;; To aid this process, we need a mechanism to get the junctions to
;; which a link connects.  Therefore, we calculate the ``inverse
;; map'', which is a map of each link to its input and output
;; junctions (joints); i.e., the junction at its head and at its tail.

;; An inverse-map is an alist of link names and their corresponding
;; connecting junctions.

;; For example, ((S2 (0 . 2) (2 . 2)) (S1 (2 . 2) (0 . 2)) ...)

;; the addition of new packets
;;  * removes any delivered packets
;;  * reset the processed_bits of the packets
