This is the README for /books/projects/apply/.  Files include:

apply-lemmas.lisp -- an initial set of lemmas we think are useful when
  proving theorems about apply$

report.lisp -- the events mentioned in the Examples section of the
   paper ``Limited Second Order Functionality in a First Order
   Setting'' by Kaufmann and Moore

Note that report.lisp starts by including apply-lemmas.lisp and hence
demostrates the ease with which apply-lemmas allows one to prove
user-level theorems about apply$ and mapping functions.

We welcome further development of apply-lemmas.lisp, but would urge
developers to continue to ensure that report.lisp (or a principled
revision of it) demonstrates the efficacy of the new
apply-lemmas.lisp.
