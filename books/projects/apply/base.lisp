; We will locally (but see below) include system/apply/apply and then
; explicitly identify some basic lemmas from it that we believe are generally
; useful to user-level proofs involving apply$.  A lot of these lemmas are
; redundant during the certification of this book but will be available to the
; user of this book.  Recall that system/apply/apply is used during the build
; of ACL2 itself, to support the sources' claims that the functions terminate
; and are guard verified.  Many of the redundant lemmas mentioned below are
; critical to those proofs -- so they have to be in system/apply/apply -- but
; are tedious to prove so we don't want to prove them again from scratch here.

; Our include-book below is non-local for a #+acl2-devel build, so that
; functions can be in logic mode as necessary (e.g., suitably-tamep-listp).  We
; need this book for #+acl2-devel builds because it is included in
; books/system/apply/loop.lisp, which is certified during devel builds in order
; to put loop$ scions in guard-verified logic mode.

; TODO: We have found that ev$-def-fact below, if stored as a :definition, gets
; in the way of some proofs in applications books (exactly which books has been
; lost in in the mists of time...).  But, oddly, we have been unsuccessful at
; disabling that :definition rule.  (We haven't pursued this possible bug yet.)
; And in earlier versions of books/projects/apply/report.lisp we needed to
; force ev$ open more often than the :definition rule opened it automatically.
; So we prove an opener below.  But we need the :definition rule to do it!  And
; since we can't apparently disable the :definition rule, we prove it locally.
; And since we like to advertise the fact that ev$ has a rather beautiful
; definition for tamep terms, we prove ev$-def-fact as :rule-classes nil.

; Hints at resolving the above mystery: By proving ev$-def after including this
; book and then doing :pr ev$-def we see that
; Clique:       (EV$)
; Controller-alist: ((EV$ T NIL))
; so we speculate the problem mentioned above might have to do with the
; induction heuristic being applied to a disabled rule.  But we haven't
; investigated this possibility yet.

; Recall the discussion of the deprecated LAMB Hack in apply.lisp:

; Historical Note:  Once upon a time we had a final step:

;    10. The LAMB Hack
;        Define (LAMB vars body) to be `(LAMBDA ,vars ,body) to provide a
;        rewrite target for functional-equivalence lemmas.  Since ACL2 doesn't
;        rewrite constants, we won't even try to simplify a quoted lambda.  We
;        are not satisfied with the treatment of functional equivalence yet and
;        LAMB is sort of a reminder and placeholder for future work.

; However, we have removed that from the sources because we are not yet
; convinced it is a good way to address the problem of rewriting equivalent
; LAMBDAs.  We plan to experiment with solutions in the user-maintained books.
; As of Version_8.0, our best shot is in
; books/projects/apply/base.lisp (formerly apply-lemmas.lisp), but this may
; change.

; But like the LAMB hack, we see this as a placeholder for more work.

; (compose f g) is f o g = (lambda (v) (f (g v))), for tame functions of arity
; 1.

; Wikipedia notes that the meaning of the ``(f o g)'' notation varies among
; authors.  To some, (f o g) applied to v is (f (g v)) while to others it is (g
; (f v)).  Our convention is that g is the inner function, i.e., applied first,
; and f is the outer one, in keeping with the syntactic order of f and g in the
; notation.

; We considered allowing g to be of arbitrary arity: since g must be tame, it
; has a badge and we could obtain its arity n from that and then create (lambda
; (v1 ... vn) (f (g v1 ... vn))).  But g must return 1 result so f must be of
; arity 1 since we don't have currying.  It just seems simpler to assume that
; both are arity 1.  The remaining questions are: (a) Should we name this
; function ``compose-arity-1-fns'' or something suggestive of the restriction?
; (b) Should we impose a guard requiring g to be of arity 1?  In the spirit of
; ``this is a placeholder'' we just ignore those questions for now!
