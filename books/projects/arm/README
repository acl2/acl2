This directory contains proofs of correctness of the Floating-point
operations of addition, multiplication, fused multiply-add, division,
and square root, as implemented in the FPU of an Arm Cortex-A class
high-end processor.  The proofs, developed between 2016 and 2018, are
based on C models of the Verilog RTL designs.  Functional equivalence
between the C and the Verilog has been formally verified with the
Mentor Graphic sequential logic equivalence checker SLEC, and the C
has been mechanically translated to ACL2.  The proofs are based on the
results of this translation.

The proofs reside in the subdirectories fmul, fadd, fdiv. and fsqrt.
(The FMA proof is spread across fmul and fadd.)  Each subdirectory
contains the following files.  In this description, * represents
fmul64, fadd64, fdiv64, or fsqrt64:

(1) The C model, *.cpp.

(2) A mechanically generated pseudocode version of the model, *.ps.

(3) The ACL2 translation, *.lisp.

(4) The proof script, consisting of the remaining files of the
subdirectory.  The only one of these that is intended to be
human-readable is summary.lisp, which lists the main definitions and
results that are proved in the other files.

The proofs are documented in Chapters 16-19 of this forthcoming book:
