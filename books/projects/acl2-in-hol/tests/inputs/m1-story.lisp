; Now I make it easier to write schedules and write a schedule for ifact.

; Here we use
; app                 - Problem 1-10
; repeat              - Problem 1-12

(defun ifact-loop-sched (n)
  (if (zp n)
      (repeat 0 4)
    (app (repeat 0 11)
         (ifact-loop-sched (- n 1)))))

; This can be explained: to schedule the ifact program on n starting
; at the loop pc = 2: If n is 0, schedule 4 steps, namely the
; instructions at pcs 2, 3, 13, and 14, ending at the HALT.
; Otherwise, if n is not 0, schedule the 11 instructions at pcs 2
; through 12, ending back at pc = 2, and then schedule ifact for n-1.

; We then use this to say how to schedule a complete ifact computation,
; starting at pc = 0.

(defun ifact-sched (n)
  (app (repeat 0 2)
       (ifact-loop-sched n)))

; ===========================================================================
; Now I write our example above in a slightly more precise and abstract
; way.

(defun ! (n)
  (if (zp n)
      1
    (* n (! (- n 1)))))

; And here is a function that computes factorial by running M1:

; Problem 2a-1: Define the constant *even-program* as an M1 program that takes

; Now I develop a compiler for a simple language of arithmetic,
; assignment, and while statements.

; Here we'll use
; member              - Problem 1-15
; index               - Problem 1-16
; len                 - Problem 1-9

; The syntax of our language is

; <expr>         := <var>|<int-constant>|( <expr> <op> <expr> )

; <op>           := + | - | *

; <test>         := ( <expr> > <expr>)

; <stmt>         := ( <var> = <expr> ) |
;                   ( while <test> <stmt*>) |
;                   ( return <expr> )

; <stmt*>        := <stmt> | <stmt> <stmt*>

; <program>      := ( <stmt*> )

; <var>          := any ACL2 symbol

; <int-constant> := any ACL2 integer

; Thus, an example program is:

; ((a = 1)
;  (while (n > 0)
;    (a = (n * a))
;    (n = (n - 1)))
;  (return a))

; For the purposes of this exercise, we will assume that every
; program we wish to compile is syntactically well-formed.

; We first define a function, collect-vars-in-stmt*, that sweeps over
; a list of statements and collects all the variables it finds.  It
; adds the variables to the end of a running accumulator.  That
; accumulator will be initiallized to the list of formals of the
; method we're compiling.  The new variables accumulated onto it will
; be the temporary variables of the method.  The order of the
; collected list will determine where the variables are allocated in
; the locals.  The first formal will be given index 0, the next index
; 1, etc.

(defun collect-at-end (list e)    ;;; Add e to the end of list
  (if (member e list)             ;;; unless it is already in list.
      list
    (app list (cons e nil))))

; These two theorems are necessary for the proof of termination of
; collect-vars-in-expr, below.

(defthm nth-nil
  (equal (nth n nil) nil))

(defthm acl2-count-nth
  (implies (consp list)
           (< (acl2-count (nth n list))
              (acl2-count list)))
  :rule-classes :linear)

(defun collect-vars-in-expr (vars expr)       ;;; Sweep expr and collect
  (if (atom expr)                             ;;; all variable names into
      (if (symbolp expr)                      ;;; vars.
          (collect-at-end vars expr)
        vars)
    (collect-vars-in-expr
     (collect-vars-in-expr vars
                           (nth 0 expr))
     (nth 2 expr))))

; Note that if expr is not an atom, it is of the form
; ( <expr> + <expr> ) or
; ( <expr> - <expr> ) or
; ( <expr> * <expr> ).

; Hence, (nth 0 expr) is the first subexpression and (nth 2 expr) is
; the second.

; Now we collect the vars in a statement.  This is defined mutually
; recursively with the vars in a list of statements.

(mutual-recursion

(defun collect-vars-in-stmt* (vars stmt-list)
  (if (endp stmt-list)
      vars
    (collect-vars-in-stmt*
     (collect-vars-in-stmt vars (car stmt-list))
     (cdr stmt-list))))

  (if (equal (nth 1 stmt) '=)

       (nth 2 stmt))
    (if (equal (nth 0 stmt) 'WHILE)
        (collect-vars-in-stmt*

      (if (equal (nth 0 stmt) 'RETURN)
          (collect-vars-in-expr vars (nth 1 stmt))
        vars))))
)

; We will use the function index to determine the position of a
; variable in the list of variables.

; Now we begin the code generation.  To compile an expression
; like (<expr> op <expr>), we'll generate code that leaves the
; values of the two subexpressions on the stack and then we'll
; execute the bytecode that pops those two values and pushes the
; result of executing op.

; The bytecode program to execute op (assuming its arguments are
; on the stack):

(defun OP! (op)
  (if (equal op '+)
      '((IADD))
    (if (equal op '-)
        '((ISUB))
      (if (equal op '*)
          '((IMUL))
        '((ILLEGAL))))))

; Note that the output above is a bytecode program, i.e., a list of
; instructions (in this case, always a trivial list of length 1).  All
; our functions for generating code generate bytecode programs so we
; can combine them with concatentation.

; The bytecode program to put the value of a variable on the stack:

(defun ILOAD! (vars var)
  (cons (cons 'ILOAD (cons (index var vars) nil))
        nil))

; The bytecode program to put the value of a constant on the stack:

; The bytecode program to put the value of an expression on the stack:

; if it is less than or equal to 0:

; The bytecode program to jump by offset:

(defun GOTO! (offset)
  (cons (cons 'GOTO (cons offset nil))
        nil))

; The bytecode program to evaluate a while statement (given the
; bytecode programs for the test and body):

(defun while! (test-code body-code)

; To compile (while test stmt1...stmtn) we first compile code that
; leaves a positive on the stack if test is true and a non-positive on

; we compile the statements in the body.  Call that code body1, ...,
; bodyn.  Note that the length of the test code is k and the length of
; the body code is n.  We return:

; (test1            ; top of WHILE
;  ...
;  testk            ; value of test is on the stack
;  (IFLE 2+n)       ; if test false, jump past body code
;  body1
;  ...
;  bodyn
;  (GOTO -(n+1+k))  ; go back to top of WHILE
;  )                ; we're done with the WHILE

; The bytecode program to leave a positive on the stack if test is
; true and a non-positive otherwise:

(defun test! (vars test)

; Test has to be of the form (x > y), where x and y are expressions.
; If y is 0, then we can just leave the value of x on the stack, that
; is, the test is true or false exactly according to whether the value
; of x is positive or not positive.  If y is not 0, we act like we saw
; (x-y > 0), which is equivalent and which statisfies the first
; condition.

; Proof that the factorial code computes factorial.  I lay this out as
; a series of 7 steps.  The steps are:

; [1] Specify the concepts related to what you're doing.

; [2] Write the program.

; [3] Specify how long it takes to execute (starting with the
;     loop).  In particular, define a scheduler function that
;     will run this program to completion.

; [4] Test the program and your scheduler.

; [5] Prove your program does what it does, starting with the
;     loop.

; [6] Prove what we do is what we want.

; [7] Put it all together.

; Concretely, for the  factorial code, here are the steps.

; [1] Specify the concepts related to what you're doing.
;     Typically we do it at two levels,
;     (a) What we want.
;     (b) How we'll do it.

; (a) What we want:

(defun ! (n)
  (if (zp n)
      1
    (* n (! (- n 1)))))

; (b) How we'll do it:  We'll compute (ifact n 1), where

(defun ifact (n a)
  (if (zp n)
      a
    (ifact (- n 1) (* n a))))

; [2] Write the program.

; Below I show the bytecode program.  It is the one generated by
; our compiler.  But I will deal with the bytecode directly, not
; the source code.

; [3] Specify how long it takes to execute (starting with the loop).
;     In particular, define a scheduler function that will
;     run this program to completion.  We've already done this:

(defun ifact-loop-sched (n)
  (if (zp n)
      (repeat 0 4)
    (app (repeat 0 11)
         (ifact-loop-sched (- n 1)))))

(defun ifact-sched (n)
  (app (repeat 0 2)
       (ifact-loop-sched n)))

; [4] Test the program and your scheduler.

; We define a little ``test harness'' to let us compute ifact
; on any natural, using the ifact program.

(defun test-ifact (n)
  (top
   (stack
    (run (ifact-sched n)

                     nil
                     *ifact-program*)))))

; Normally we would just try out a few examples, e.g.,

; posterity I will just write a trivial theorem to prove.

; Now we develop the macros that make all this more palatable.

; The semantic functions for each instruction return a new state
; constructed from parts of an old one, s.  Typically the new
; state is just s with one or two components changed.  The others
; are fixed, for that instruction.

; A good example is that of ILOAD:

; (make-state (+ 1 (pc s))
;             (locals s)
;             (push (nth (arg1 inst)
;                        (locals s))
;                   (stack s))
;             (program s))

; We can write a macro that allows us to express this as
;
; (modify s
;         :stack (push (nth (arg1 inst)
;                           (locals s))
;                      (stack s)))

; The modify expression above expands EXACTLY to the make-state shown
; above it.  Modify is just an abbreviation for a make-state.  But we
; only have to write the parts that change in ``unusual'' ways.  Since
; pc is almost always incremented by one, modify will always produce
; (+ 1 (pc s)) in the pc slot of the make-state, unless we supply the
; :pc keyword to modify along with the correct new pc.

; So here is the modify macro.  It generates a make-state.  The first
; slot is the pc slot, the second is the locals, etc.  For each of the
; keys :pc, :locals, :stack, and :program, if that key is supplied
; among the args to modify, then the make-state has the corresponding
; val in that key's slot.  Otherwise, that key's slot is occupied by
; an expression that computes the value of that slot in state s.  The
; :pc slot is an exception: the default value is the old value
; incremented by one.

; Because we frequently use such expressions as (arg2 inst) and (stack

;               (push (arg1 inst) (stack s))

; we could write

; (defun execute-ICONST (inst s)
;   (semantics (ICONST c)
;              (modify s :stack (push c -stack-))))

; But in fact, we'll introduce yet another macro so we can just write:

; (defsem (ICONST c)
;   (modify s :stack (push c -stack-)))

; and it will
; * generate the name execute-ICONST,
; * fill in the formals, and
; * use the semantics function to generate the body.

; So now we define defsem...

; The next function is easily understood by example.
; (concat-symbols 'EXECUTE- 'ICONST) will return the
; symbol EXECUTE-ICONST.

; I have not told you how to create symbols because we don't need it -- except
; for this one use of going from an instruction opcode to the semantic function
; name.  Just trust me that this function generates a symbol in the M1 package
; whose name is the concatenation of the names of the two parts.

; (defun foo (x) (+ 1 x))

; But, (make-defun 'foo '(x y) '(declare (ignore y)) '(+ 1 x))
