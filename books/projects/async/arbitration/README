arb-merge-1.lisp: a simple arbitrated merge joint arb-merge-1.

arb-merge.lisp: a more complex arbitrated merge joint arb-merge.

interl.lisp: a circuit family, interl, that connects two instances of
Q20' to the two input ports of arb-merge-1.

interl-ll.lisp: a circuit family, interl-ll, that connects Q9' and
Q11' to the two input ports of arb-merge.  It is designed as a left
half-complex link.

igcd.lisp: a circuit family, igcd, that concatenates interl and gcd.

comp-interl.lisp: a circuit family, comp-interl, that connects the
outputs from two instances of interl to the inputs of a third instance
of interl.

comp-interl2.lisp: a circuit family, comp-interl2, that connects the
outputs from two instances of interl to the inputs of an instance of
interl-ll.
