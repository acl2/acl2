gcd-alg.lisp: a GCD algorithm and its correctness theorems.

gcd-spec.lisp: a GCD specification at the bit-vector level.

gcd.lisp: a circuit family, gcd, computing the Greatest Common Divisor
(GCD) of two natural numbers.

comp-gcd-body.lisp: a circuit family, comp-gcd-body, performing the
GCD operation in one iteration.  It is constructed using the
ripple-carry subtractor ripple-sub.

comp-gcd.lisp: a GCD circuit family, c-gcd, that contains
comp-gcd-body as a submodule.

comp-gcd-body2.lisp: a circuit family, comp-gcd-body2, performing the
GCD operation in one iteration.  It is constructed using the
self-timed serial subtractor serial-sub.

comp-gcd2.lisp: a GCD circuit family, c-gcd2, that contains
comp-gcd-body2 as a submodule.

comp-gcd-cond.lisp: a circuit family, comp-gcd-cond, performing the
GCD condition. It contains Q2 and Q3 as submodules.

comp-gcd3.lisp: a GCD circuit family, c-gcd3, that contains comp-gcd-cond
as a submodule.

q10-gcd.lisp: a GCD circuit family, q10-gcd, that concatenates Q10 and
gcd.

q10-comp-gcd3.lisp: a GCD circuit family, q10-c-gcd3, that concatenates
Q10 and c-gcd3.
