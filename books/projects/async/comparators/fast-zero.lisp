;; A zero detector optimized for quick detection of the last 2 bits of the
;; input vector.  It should save a few nanoseconds in the FM9001.

;; LSI Logic timing analysis of the final design showed that this "fast"
;; zero-detector was about the same as simple, fully-balanced zero-detectors
;; defined in "t-or-nor.lisp".
