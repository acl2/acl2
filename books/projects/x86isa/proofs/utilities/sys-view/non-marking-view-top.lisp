  :short "General-purpose code-proof libraries to include in the
  system-level non-marking view (with A/D flag updates off)"

  :long "<p>When reasoning about an supervisor-mode program in the
  system-level <i>non-marking</i> view of the x86 ISA model, include
  the book @('x86isa/proofs/utilities/sys-view/non-marking-view-top')
  to make use of some standard rules you would need to control the
  symbolic simulation of the program.</p>

  <p>If unwinding the @('(x86-run ... x86)') expression during your
  proof attempt does not result in a 'clean' expression (i.e., one
  entirely in terms of updates made to the initial state as opposed to
  in terms of @(see x86-fetch-decode-execute) or @(see x86-run)), then
  there is a good chance that you're missing some preconditions, or
  that the existing rules are not good enough.  In any case, it can
  help to @(see acl2::monitor) the existing rules to figure out what's
  wrong.  Feel free to send on suggestions for new rules or improving
  existing ones!</p>

  <p>You can monitor the following rules, depending on the kind of
  subgoals you see, to get some clues.  You can find definitions of
  these rules in @(see unwind-x86-interpreter-in-non-marking-view).</p>

  <ul>

    <li>When the subgoal has calls of @('x86-run'): <br/>
        Monitor @('x86-run-opener-not-ms-not-zp-n').
   </li>

    <li>When the subgoal has calls of @(see x86-fetch-decode-execute): <br/>
        Monitor @('x86-fetch-decode-execute-opener').
   </li>

   <li>When monitoring @('x86-fetch-decode-execute-opener') tells you
    that a hypothesis involving @(see get-prefixes) was not rewritten
    to @('t'): <br/>
    Monitor
    @('get-prefixes-opener-lemma-no-prefix-byte'). <br/>
    Note that if the instruction under consideration has prefix
    bytes, you should monitor one of these rules instead: <br/>
    @('get-prefixes-opener-lemma-group-1-prefix') <br/>
    @('get-prefixes-opener-lemma-group-2-prefix') <br/>
    @('get-prefixes-opener-lemma-group-3-prefix') <br/>
    @('get-prefixes-opener-lemma-group-4-prefix').
  </li>

    <li>When monitoring other rules above indicates that an
    instruction is not being fetched successfully using @(see rb):
    <br/>
    Monitor @('one-read-with-rb-from-program-at-in-non-marking-view').
    </li>

   <li>When monitoring other rules above indicates that ACL2 can't
    resolve that the program remained unchanged (@(see
    program-at)) after a write operation @(see wb) occurred: <br/>
    Monitor @('program-at-wb-disjoint-in-non-marking-view'). <br/>
    <br/>
    An instance of where monitoring this rule might be helpful is when
    the @('program-at') hypothesis of
    @('one-read-with-rb-from-program-at-in-non-marking-view') is not
    being relieved.
   </li>

   <li>When inferring the canonical nature of a linear address:<br/>
    Monitor @('member-p-canonical-address-listp'). <br/>
    <br/>
    This is useful if you believe that the canonical nature of a
    linear address should be inferable from the canonical nature of a
    list of addresses, of which that address is a member.  An instance
    of where monitoring this rule
    might be helpful is when the @('member-p') hypothesis of
    @('one-read-with-rb-from-program-at-in-non-marking-view') is not
    being relieved.
   </li>

   <li>When reasoning about disjointness/overlap of memory regions: <br/>
   @('rb-wb-disjoint-in-non-marking-view') <br/>
   @('rb-wb-equal-in-non-marking-view') <br/>
   @('la-to-pas-values-and-mv-nth-1-wb-disjoint-from-xlation-gov-addrs-in-non-marking-view') <br/>
   @('all-xlation-governing-entries-paddrs-and-mv-nth-1-wb-disjoint-in-non-marking-view')
   </li>

 </ul>

 <p>When symbolically simulating supervisor-mode programs, you might
 also want to do the following, which replaces ACL2's default ancestor
 check with something simpler:</p>

 <code>
 (local (include-book \"tools/trivial-ancestors-check\" :dir :system))
 (local (acl2::use-trivial-ancestors-check))
 </code>
