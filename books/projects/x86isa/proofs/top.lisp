<p>The <b>factorial program</b> has been proved correct using two methods:</p>

<ol>
<li>Inductive Assertions: See book @('factorial/fact-inductive-assertions.lisp').</li>
<li>Wormhole Abstraction: See book @('factorial/fact-wormhole-abstraction.lisp').</li>
</ol>

<p>The proof of correctness of the <b>word-count program</b> can be found in
@('word-count/wc.lisp').</p>

<p>The proof of correctness of a simple <b>array copy sub-routine</b> can be
found in @('dataCopy/dataCopy.lisp').</p>

<p>The proof of correctness of a <b>population count program</b> can be found
in @('popcount/popcount.lisp'). This proof was done using the @(see GL)
symbolic simulation framework.</p>

  ;; [Shilpi]: There are name clashes in these two factorial books.  The

  ;; ensuring that the books get built as a part of the
  ;; regression. Another way to ensure that these books get built is to
  ;; rely on cert.pl's dependency scanner and put these include-books in
  ;; a multi-line comment or something.
