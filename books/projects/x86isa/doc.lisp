  :short "A Formal and Executable Model of the x86 Instruction Set
  Architecture"

  :long "<p>These books contain the specification of x86 instruction
 set architecture \(ISA\); we characterize x86 machine instructions and
 model the instruction fetch, decode, and execute process using the
 ACL2 theorem-proving system.  We use our x86 ISA specification to
 formally verify x86 machine-code programs.</p>

 <p>These books include:</p>

 <ul>

 <li>A formal, executable x86 ISA model \(see @('machine')
 sub-directory\)</li>

 <li>General theorems to aid in machine-code verification \(see
 @('proofs/utilities') sub-directory\)</li>

 <li>Examples of using these books to verify some programs \(see
  @('proofs') sub-directory\)</li>

 </ul>

 <p>For information on how to certify these books, see @(see
 x86isa-build-instructions).</p>

 <h3>Completeness of the x86 Model</h3>

 <p>The utility of a formal ISA model for performing machine-code
 verification depends directly on the model's completeness \(with
 respect to the ISA features specified\), accuracy, and reasoning and
 execution efficiency.  <a
 href='http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html'>Intel
 software developer's manuals</a> were used as specification documents,
 and ambiguities were resolved by cross-referencing <a
 href='https://developer.amd.com/resources/developer-guides-manuals/'>AMD
 manuals</a> and running tests on real machines to understand processor
 behavior. </p>

 <p>The current focus of these books is Intel's <b>IA-32e mode</b>, which
 includes 64-bit and Compatibility sub-modes, and the <b>32-bit protected
 mode</b>.</p>

 <p>To see a list of opcodes implemented in these books, see @(see
 implemented-opcodes).</p>

 <h3>Reasoning and Execution Efficiency</h3>

 <p>These books contain a formal x86 ISA model that is not only
 capable of reasoning about x86 machine-code programs, but also of
 simulating those programs. See @(see program-execution) for
 instructions on how to set up the @('x86isa') model for executing a
 program.</p>

 <p>Reasoning efficiency is desirable to make code proofs tractable
 and execution efficiency is desirable to enable faster model
 validation via co-simulations \(See @(see model-validation)\).</p>

 <p>However, simple definitions that are suitable for reasoning
 typically offer poor execution performance and definitions optimized
 for execution efficiency often use a sufficiently different algorithm
 from the one used in the specification that they are difficult to
 reason about.  However, ACL2 offers several features to mitigate this
 trade-off between reasoning and execution efficiency.  For e.g.: @(see
 mbe) and its friends like @(see acl2::mbt), and @(see acl2::assert*),
 @(see acl2::stobj), and @(see acl2::defabsstobj).</p>

 <p>ACL2 features like abstract stobjs and @('assert*') were a response
 by the ACL2 authors to provide mechanisms to mitigate the complexity
 of reasoning vs. execution efficiency that came up over the course of
 this project.  This x86 ISA model uses abstract stobjs to layer the
 state of the x86 machine such that the lower layer \(i.e., the
 concrete stobj\, see @(see concrete-state)\) can be optimized for
 execution efficiency and the upper layer \(i.e., the abstract stobj,
 see @(see abstract-state)\) can be optimized for reasoning
 efficiency, while a correspondence theorem is proved to hold between
 these two layers at all times.  Therefore, we get the benefit of both
 fast execution and effective reasoning.</p>

 <h3>Modes of Operation</h3>

 <p>The complexity of the x86 ISA model will increase as more features are
 added to it, and this added complexity will make reasoning inevitably more
 involved.  The issue of balancing <i>verification effort</i> and
 <i>verification utility</i> is a very pertinent one.  For example, users might
 not want to reason about an application program at the level of physical
 memory, i.e., taking into account address translations and access rights
 management provided by the memory management data structures.  This is because
 it is customary for application programs not to have direct access to the
 system data structures.  The memory model seen by 64-bit application programs
 is that of linear memory, which is an OS-constructed abstraction of the
 complicated underlying memory management mechanisms like paging that are based
 on physical memory.  Therefore, verification of application programs can be
 performed at the level of linear memory, if the OS routines that manage the
 linear memory abstraction can be either trusted or proved correct.  However,
 the verification of system programs, like kernel routines, must necessarily be
 done at the level of physical memory since these programs can access/modify
 system data structures.</p>

 <p>In light of the above, the x86 ISA model provides the option to
 deactivate some features of the ISA, enabling the user to do two
 kinds of analysis, depending on the kind of programs being considered
 for verification.  Specifically, the model offers the following views
 of x86 machines:</p>

 <ol>

 <li><b>Application-Level View:</b> <p>In this view, the model
 attempts to provide the same environment for reasoning as is provided
 by an OS for programming.  It allows the verification of an
 application program while assuming that memory management, I/O
 operations, and services offered via system calls are provided
 reliably by the underlying OS.  The memory model here supports 64-bit
 linear addresses specified for IA-32e machines.  A specification of
 system calls like @('read'), @('write'), @('open'), and @('close') is
 also included in this view.</p></li>

 <li><b>System-level View:</b> <p>This view includes the specification
 for IA-32e paging and segmentation; in particular, ISA-prescribed
 data structures for memory management and (partial) specifications of
 system-mode instructions like LLDT and LGDT are available in this
 mode.  The memory model here characterizes a 52-bit physical address
 space, which is the largest physical address space provided by modern
 x86 implementations.  This view is intended to be used to simulate
 and verify software that has supervisor privileges and interacts with
 I/O devices.</p> </li>

 </ol>

 <p>An added benefit of having these two separate views is the
 increased execution speed of programs in the application-level view;
 this is because executing these programs in this view does not
 require simulating both the physical address space \(and hence,
 accesses/updates to the paging data structures\) and the linear
 address space.</p>

 <p>It would be beneficial, not to mention interesting, to verify
 whether the application-level view is an abstraction of the
 system-level view, given that the system data structures have been set
 up correctly.  As of now, establishing this relationship between the
 two modes is out of the scope of this project.</p>")

  :short "Building books related to the x86 ISA and the machine-code
  analysis framework"

  :long "<p>Some ways of building the @('x86isa') books are:</p>

 <ol>

 <li>
 <p>Using @('cert.pl top'): This @(see build::cert.pl) option should work well
 for most users.  Users who want to execute programs that utilize @('SYSCALL'),
 @('RDRAND'), etc. should consider the option listed below.</p>
 </li>

 <li>
 <p>Using the Makefile provided with the @('x86isa') books: Users of these
 books who wish to simulate x86 programs with non-deterministic computations
 like @('SYSCALL') \(in @(see app-view)\) should use the Makefile provided with
 @('x86isa') and run make with @('X86ISA_EXEC') set to @('t') \(which is the
 default value\).</p>

 <code>
 make JOBS=8 \\
      X86ISA_EXEC=t \\
      ACL2=/Users/shilpi/acl2/saved_acl2
 </code>
 <p>where the number of jobs to be run in parallel in this example is
 8.  Note that we use @('JOBS') here instead of the @('-j') flag.</p>

 <p>When @('X86ISA_EXEC') is @('t'), some dynamic C libraries that are
 used in the model for supporting the execution of @('SYSCALL') in the
 application-level view will be built.  <b>Since we rely on the foreign
 function interface of <a href='http://ccl.clozure.com/'>Clozure
 CL</a> (CCL), full execution support is available only if you use
 CCL.</b></p>

 <p>Values of @('X86ISA_EXEC') other than @('t') will not allow the
 execution of @('SYSCALL') instructions \(as may be the case with
 using other Lisps as well\).  Note that reasoning about these
 instructions will still be possible.  Execution and reasoning about
 all other instructions will always be possible, irrespective of
 @('X86ISA_EXEC') or the underlying Lisp.</p>

 <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> You should do a \"make clean\" \(or \"make
 execclean\" if you are in a hurry\) if you wish to certify the books
 with a different value of @('X86ISA_EXEC').</p>

 </li>

 <li> <p>Using the \"everything\" target of the ACL2 Community
 Books (see acl2/books/GNUmakefile): This is essentially the same as
 executing @('cert.pl books/projects/x86isa/top'). This will build the
 x86 books without full execution support, i.e., the effect will be
 the same as building these books with @('X86ISA_EXEC=nil'), even
 though the Makefile provided with the @('x86isa') books will not be
 used.</p> </li>

 </ol>

 <p>Suppose you had certified these books previously, but you have
 since forgotten whether you built them with @('X86ISA_EXEC=t') or not.
 Here is a way of checking the certified books to see if you have full
 execution support. Look at the following file:
 @('machine/syscalls.cert.out'). If this file contains the
 following: </p>

 <code>X86ISA_EXEC Warning: environment-and-syscalls-raw.lsp is not
 included.</code>

 <p>then you do <i>not</i> have @('SYSCALL') execution support.
 Otherwise, you do.</p>"
