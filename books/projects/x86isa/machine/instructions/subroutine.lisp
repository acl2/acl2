;; INSTRUCTION: CALL
;; ======================================================================

;; From Intel Vol. 1, 6-11:

;; In 64-bit mode, the operand size for all near branches (CALL, RET,
;; JCC, JCXZ, JMP, and LOOP) is forced to 64 bits. These instructions
;; update the 64-bit RIP without the need for a REX operand-size
;; prefix.

;; The following aspects of near branches are controlled by the
;; effective operand size:

;; Truncation of the size of the instruction pointer Size of a stack
;; pop or push, due to a CALL or RET Size of a stack-pointer increment
;; or decrement, due to a CALL or RET Indirect-branch operand size

;; In 64-bit mode, all of the above actions are forced to 64 bits
;; regardless of operand size prefixes (operand size prefixes are
;; silently ignored). However, the displacement field for relative
;; branches is still limited to 32 bits and the address size for near
;; branches is not forced in 64-bit mode.

;; Address sizes affect the size of RCX used for JCXZ and LOOP; they
;; also impact the address calculation for memory indirect
;; branches. Such addresses are 64 bits by default; but they can be
;; overridden to 32 bits by an address size prefix.
