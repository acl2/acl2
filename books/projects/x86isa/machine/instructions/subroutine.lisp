;; ======================================================================
;; INSTRUCTION: CALL
;; ======================================================================

;; From Intel manual, Mar'17, Volume 1, Section 6.3.7:

;; In 64-bit mode, the operand size for all near branches (CALL, RET,
;; JCC, JCXZ, JMP, and LOOP) is forced to 64 bits. These instructions
;; update the 64-bit RIP without the need for a REX operand-size
;; prefix.

;; The following aspects of near branches are controlled by the
;; effective operand size:
;;   Truncation of the size of the instruction pointer
;;   Size of a stack pop or push, due to a CALL or RET
;;   Size of a stack-pointer increment or decrement, due to a CALL or RET
;;   Indirect-branch operand size

;; In 64-bit mode, all of the above actions are forced to 64 bits
;; regardless of operand size prefixes (operand size prefixes are
;; silently ignored). However, the displacement field for relative
;; branches is still limited to 32 bits and the address size for near
;; branches is not forced in 64-bit mode.

;; Address sizes affect the size of RCX used for JCXZ and LOOP; they
;; also impact the address calculation for memory indirect
;; branches. Such addresses are 64 bits by default; but they can be
;; overridden to 32 bits by an address size prefix.

(def-inst x86-call-E8-Op/En-M

  ;; Op/En: M
  ;; E8 cw (CALL rel16)
  ;; E8 cd (CALL rel32)
  ;; Note E8 cw (CALL rel16) is N.S. in 64-bit mode.

  ;; The address-size override prefix will not have any effect here
  ;; since we have no memory operands.

  ;; 16-bit stack address size is allowed in 64-bit mode, in which the stack
  ;; size is always 64 bits. For now we use the operand size for both
  ;; assignments, implicitly assuming that it is equal to the stack address
  ;; size. TODO: We should test if a real processor accepts LEAVE instructions
  ;; whose StackAddressSize and OperandSize differ; we should also test if a
  ;; real processor allows operations just on BP and SP (i.e. 16-bit size) in
  ;; 64-bit mode.
