;; ======================================================================
;; INSTRUCTION: (one-byte opcode map)

;; ======================================================================

; From Intel Vol. 1, Section 6.3.7:

;; In 64-bit mode, the operand size for all near branches (CALL, RET, JCC,
;; JCXZ, JMP, and LOOP) is forced to 64 bits. These instructions update the
;; 64-bit RIP without the need for a REX operand-size prefix.

;; The following aspects of near branches are controlled by the effective
;; operand size:
;;   Truncation of the size of the instruction pointer
;;   Size of a stack pop or push, due to a CALL or RET
;;   Size of a stack-pointer increment or decrement, due to a CALL or RET
;;   Indirect-branch operand size

;; In 64-bit mode, all of the above actions are forced to 64 bits regardless of
;; operand size prefixes (operand size prefixes are silently ignored). However,
;; the displacement field for relative branches is still limited to 32 bits and
;; the address size for near branches is not forced in 64-bit mode.

;; Address sizes affect the size of RCX used for JCXZ and LOOP; they also
;; impact the address calculation for memory indirect branches. Such addresses
;; are 64 bits by default; but they can be overridden to 32 bits by an address
;; size prefix.

<p>Source: Intel Manuals \(Vol. 2A\) Instruction Set Reference: the
text below has been edited to contain information only about the
64-bit mode.</p>

<p><i>The JMP instruction cannot be used to perform
inter-privilege-level far jumps.</i> The processor always uses the
segment selector part of the far address to access the corresponding
descriptor in the GDT or LDT. The descriptor type and access rights
determine the type of jump to be performed.</p>

<p><b>Far Jump to a Conforming or Non-Conforming Code Segment:</b> If
the selected descriptor is for a code segment, a far jump to a code
segment at the same privilege level is performed. If the selected code
segment is at a different privilege level and the code segment is
non-conforming, a general-protection exception is generated.  The
target operand specifies an absolute far address indirectly with a
memory location \(m16:16 or m16:32 or m16:64\). The operand-size
attribute and the REX.w bit determine the size of the offset \(16 or
32 or 64 bits\) in the far address. The new code segment selector and
its descriptor are loaded into CS register, and the offset from the
instruction is loaded into the RIP register.</p>

<p><b>Far Jump through a Call Gate:</b> When executing a far jump
through a call gate, the segment selector specified by the target
operand identifies the call gate. The offset part of the target
operand is ignored. The processor then jumps to the code segment
specified in the call gate descriptor and begins executing the
instruction at the offset specified in the call gate. No stack switch
occurs. The target operand specifies the far address of the call gate
indirectly with a memory location \(m16:16 or m16:32 or m16:64\).</p>"

; From Intel Vol. 1, Section 6.3.7:

;; In 64-bit mode, the operand size for all near branches (CALL, RET, JCC,
;; JCXZ, JMP, and LOOP) is forced to 64 bits. These instructions update the
;; 64-bit RIP without the need for a REX operand-size prefix.

;; The following aspects of near branches are controlled by the effective
;; operand size:
;;   Truncation of the size of the instruction pointer
;;   Size of a stack pop or push, due to a CALL or RET
;;   Size of a stack-pointer increment or decrement, due to a CALL or RET
;;   Indirect-branch operand size

;; In 64-bit mode, all of the above actions are forced to 64 bits regardless of
;; operand size prefixes (operand size prefixes are silently ignored). However,
;; the displacement field for relative branches is still limited to 32 bits and
;; the address size for near branches is not forced in 64-bit mode.

;; Address sizes affect the size of RCX used for JCXZ and LOOP; they also
;; impact the address calculation for memory indirect branches. Such addresses
;; are 64 bits by default; but they can be overridden to 32 bits by an address
;; size prefix.
