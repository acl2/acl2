  decoder function @(see x86-fetch-decode-execute).</li>

  <li> They contain or act as the functional specification of the
  instructions.  For example, the functional specification function of
  the ADD instruction returns two values: the appropriately truncated
  sum of the operands and the modified flags. We do not deal with the
  x86 state in these specifications.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each semantic function takes, among other arguments, the value
@('start-rip') of the instruction pointer at the beginning of the
instruction, and the value @('temp-rip') of the instruction pointer
after the decoding of the prefixes, REX byte, opcode, ModR/M byte, and
SIB byte (some of these bytes may not be present).  The semantic
function may further increment the instruction pointer beyond
@('temp-rip') to read the ending bytes of the instruction, e.g. to
read a displacement or an immediate.  The semantic function eventually
writes the final value of the instruction pointer into RIP.</p>")
