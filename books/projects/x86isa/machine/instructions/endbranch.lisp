  "<p>For now we model ENDBR32 and ENDBR64 as no-ops,
   effectively assuming no CET support
   (see Intel manual Volume 1 Chapter 17 of Dec 2023).
   In the future, we will add proper support
   (conditional under CPU features).</p>

   <p>These are instructions with two-byte opcodes,
   according to their specification in Intel manual Volume 2 of Dec 2023.
   However, Table A-3 of the same manual
   shows \"Reserved-NOP\" for <tt>F3 0F 1E</tt>.
   Perhaps that table has not been updated yet,
   but note that the `NOP' is consistent with the fact that
   ENDBR32 and ENDBR64 are no-ops in legacy platforms.
   It seems that the <tt>FB</tt> (for ENDBR32) and <tt>FA</tt> (for ENDBR64)
   are opcode extensions, which differentiate between the two.</p>

   <p>This ACL2 function is called when
   the bytes <tt>0F 1E</tt> are encountered during decoding,
   possibly with prefixes.
   Since the <tt>F3</tt> prefix is mandatory for these instructions,
   in this ACL2 function we check that it is present.</p>

   <p>It is not clear whether the presence of other prefixes is allowed.
   For now we allow and ignore them, but we may revise this</p>

   <p>Then we ensure that there is at least one more byte,
   which must be either <tt>FB</tt> or <tt>FA</tt>.
   Otherwise, the throw a #UD, which seems appropriate,
   although it is not immediately clear from the Intel manual
   whether there are other instructions that also start with <tt>F3 0F 1E</tt>.
   Also this may be revised in the future.</p>

   <p>It is not clear from the Intel manual what should happen
   if ENDBR32 is used in 64-bit mode or ENDBR64 is used in 32-bit mode.
   For now, we allow them, since we treat them as no-op anyhow.</p>

   <p>For generality, we may want to rename this ACL2 function
   to something like @('x86-reserved-nop-1e'),
   so that it can accommodate potentially other (future?)
   instructions besides ENDBR32 and ENDBR64.</p>"
