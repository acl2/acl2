     when the instruction pointer is incremented
     or when an instruction byte is eventually accessed;
     the Intel and AMD manuals seem unclear in this respect.
     But since the failure of these checks stops execution with an error,
     and it is in a way always ``safe'' to stop execution with an error

     In 32-bit mode, the instruction pointer is 32 or 16 bits
     based on the CS.D bit, i.e. the D bit of the current code segment descriptor.
     In these cases, the argument to this function should be
     a 32-bit or 16-bit unsigned integer, which is also a 48-bit signed integer.
     </p>
     <p>
     See AMD manual, Oct'13, Vol. 1, Sec. 2.2.4 and Sec. 2.5.
     AMD manual, Apr'16, Vol. 2, Sec 4.7.2.,
     and Intel manual, Mar'17, Vol. 1, Sec. 3.6.
     </p>
     <p>
     According to Intel manual, Mar'17, Vol. 1, Table 3-1,
     it seems that
     when writing a 32-bit instruction pointer (EIP)
     the high 32 bits of RIP should be set to 0,
     and when writing a 16-bit instruction pointer (IP)
     the high 48 bits of RIP should be left unmodified;
     since in our model the RIP is 48 bits,
     the above applies to the high 16 and 32 bits, respectively.
     The pseudocode for the JMP instruction in Intel manual, Mar'17, Vol. 2
     shows an assignment @('EIP <- tempEIP AND 0000FFFFh') for the 16-bit case,
     which seems to imply that
     the high 32 (or 16, in our model) bits are left unmodified
     and the high 16 bits of EIP are set to 0,
     which would contradict Table 3-1;
     the pseudocode for some other instructions
     that directly write the instruction pointer (e.g. RET and Jcc)
     show similar assignments.
     However, it is possible that this assignment has a typo and should be
     @('IP <- tempEIP AND 0000FFFFh') instead,
     which would be consistent with Table 3-1.
     But we also note that the pseudocode for the JMP instruction
     shows an assignment @('EIP <- tempEIP') for the 32-bit case,
     which seems to imply that
     the high 32 (or 16, in our model) bits are left unmodified,
     which would contradict Table 3-1.
     The AMD manuals do not show pseudocode for these instructions,
     and AMD manual, Oct'13, Vol. 1, Fig. 2-10
     (which is somewhat analogous to Intel's Table 3-1)
     shows the high bits simply grayed out;
     so the AMD manuals do not provide disambiguation help.
     It is also possible that Table 3-1 has a typo and should say
     that a 16-bit instruction pointer is zero-extended,
     but that is not quite consistent with the pseudocode assignments to EIP,
     which seem to imply that the high bits are untouched.
     Table 3-1 is under a section titled
     `Address Calculation in 64-Bit Mode',
     which may suggest that the table may not apply to 32-bit mode,
     but then it is not clear how it would just apply to 64-bit mode.
     For now, we decide to have this function follow Intel's Table 3-1,
     but we may revise that if we manage to resolve these ambiguities.
     We also note that Intel's Table 3-1 is consistent with the way in which
     32-bit and 16-bit values are written to general-purpose registers
     (even though RIP/EIP/IP is not a general-purpose register);
     see @(tsee wr32) and @(tsee wr16).
     </p>
     <p>
     This function should be always called
     with an instruction pointer of the right type
     (48-bit signed, 32-bit unsigned, or 16-bit unsigned)
     based on the mode and code segment.
     We may add a guard to ensure that in the future,
     but for now in the code below
     we coerce the instruction pointer to 32 and 16 bits as appropriate,
     to verify guards;
     these coercions are expected not to change
     the argument instruction pointer.

     The amount may be positive (increment) or negative (decrement).
     This just calculates the new stack pointer value,
     without storing it into the register RSP, ESP, or SP.
     The starting value is the result of @(tsee read-*sp)
     or a previous invocation of @(tsee add-to-*sp).
     </p>
     <p>
     The increment or decrement is modular:
     64 bits in 64-bit mode,
     and either 32 or 16 bits in 32-bit mode (depending on the SS.B bit).
     Since our model uses signed 64-bit addresses, we use @(tsee i64) for them,
     while we use @(tsee n32) or @(tsee n16) for 32-bit and 16-bit addresses.
     </p>
     <p>
     In 64-bit mode, we check whether the result is a canonical address;
     in 32-bit mode, we check whether the result is within the segment limit.
     If these checks are not satisfied,
     this function returns an error flag (and 0 as new pointer),
     which causes the x86 model to stop execution with an error.
     It is not clear whether these checks should be performed
     when the stack pointer is updated,
     or when the stack is eventually accessed through the updated pointer;
     the Intel and AMD manuals seem unclear in this respect.
     But since the failure of these checks stops execution with an error,
     and it is in a way always ``safe'' to stop execution with an error
     (in the sense that the model provides no guarantees when this happens),
     for now we choose to perform these checks here.
     </p>
     <p>
     Note that a stack segment may be expand-down or expand-up
     (see Intel manual, Mar'17, Vol. 3, Sec. 3.4.5.1),
     so the checks need to cover these two cases.
     See @(tsee segment-base-and-bounds) and @(tsee ea-to-la).

    "<p>
     In 64-bit mode, a 64-bit stack pointer is written into the full RSP.
     Since, in the model, this is a 64-bit signed integer,
     this function consumes a 64-bit signed integer.
     </p>
     <p>
     In 32-bit mode, the stack pointer is 32 or 16 bits based on the SS.B bit,
     i.e. the B bit of the current stack segment descriptor.
     In these cases, the argument to this function should be
     a 32-bit or 16-bit unsigned integer, which is also a 64-bit signed integer.
     </p>
     <p>
     See Intel manual, Mar'17, Vol. 1, Sec. 6.2.3 and Sec. 6.2.5,
     and AMD manual, Apr'16, Vol. 2, Sec 2.4.5 and Sec. 4.7.3.
     The actual size of the value consumed by this function
     should be @('StackAddrSize'),
     introduced in Intel manual, Mar'17, Vol. 2, Sec. 3.1.1.9.
     </p>
     <p>
     The pseudocode of stack instructions like PUSH
     in Intel manual, Mar'17, Vol. 2
     show assignments of the form
     @('RSP <- ...'), @('ESP <- ...'), and @('SP <- ...')
     based on the stack address size.
     This may suggests that
     when the stack address size is 32
     the assignment to ESP leaves the high 32 bits of RSP unchanged,
     and when the stack address size is 16
     the assignment to SP leaves the high 48 bits of RSP unchanged.
     However,
     as explained in the documentation of @(tsee wr32) and @(tsee wr16),
     normally writing to the low 32 bits of a general-purpose register
     (which RSP/ESP/SP is) zeros the high 32 bits,
     while writing the low 16 bits leaves the high 48 bits unchanged.
     Thus, we follow this requirement also when writing RSP/ESP/SP implicitly,
     via stack manipulation instructions like PUSH that use
     this @(tsee write-*sp) function to update the stack pointer register.
     </p>
     <p>
     This function should be always called
     with a stack pointer of the right type
     (64-bit signed, 32-bit unsigned, or 16-bit unsigned)
     based on the stack address size.
     We may add a guard to ensure that in the future,
     but for now in the code below
     we coerce the stack pointer to 32 and 16 bits as appropriate,
     to verify guards;
     these coercions are expected not to change the argument stack pointer.

    (such as the FS and GS bases, if FS and GS overrides are present)

    Addition of those segment base addresses is a part of the
    segmentation process --- we handle that in the function @(see
    ea-to-la) that performs the segment address translation.</p>

    <p>Quoting from Intel Vol 1, Sec 3.3.7:</p>

       <p><em>In 64-bit mode, the effective address components are
       added and the effective address is truncated (See for example
       the instruction LEA) before adding the full 64-bit segment
       base. The base is never truncated, regardless of addressing
       mode in 64-bit mode.</em></p>

      <p>Quoting Intel Vol. 1 Sec. 3.3.7 (Address Calculations in
      64-Bit Mode):</p>

	<p><em>All 16-bit and 32-bit address calculations are
	zero-extended in IA-32e mode to form 64-bit addresses. Address
	calculations are first truncated to the effective address size
	of the current mode (64-bit mode or compatibility mode), as
	overridden by any address-size prefix. The result is then
	zero-extended to the full 64-bit address width. Because of
	this, 16-bit and 32-bit applications running in compatibility
	mode can access only the low 4 GBytes of the 64-bit mode
	effective addresses. Likewise, a 32-bit address generated in
	64-bit mode can access only the low 4 GBytes of the 64-bit
	mode effective addresses.</em></p>

    <p>Also: Intel Vol 1, Section 3.3.7 says that we need
    sign-extended displacements in effective address calculations. In
    Lisp, sign-extension is implicit.</p>

    <p>In 64-bit mode, instructions such as LEA use this function to
    compute the effective address.  LEA, at least, does not check
    whether the generated address is canonical or not, which is why we
    don't make the canonical-address-p check in this function.</p>

    <p>In 64-bit mode,
    we use @('rgfi-size') to read bases as signed linear addresses,
    which encode canonical linear addresses,
    which are also effective addresses in 64-bit mode.
    In 32-bit mode,
    we use @('rr32') to read bases as unsigned effective addresses.</p>"

 enabled. Alignment checks are only carried out in data (or stack)
 accesses (not in code fetches or system segment accesses). An example
 of an alignment-check violation is a word stored at an odd byte
 address, or a doubleword stored at an address that is not an integer
 multiple of 4.</blockquote>

 <blockquote>Note that the alignment check exception (#AC) is
 generated only for data types that must be aligned on word,
 doubleword, and quadword boundaries. A general-protection
 exception (#GP) is generated 128-bit data types that are not aligned
 on a 16-byte boundary.</blockquote>

   </p>
   <p>
   Otherwise, we use the default segment selection rules
   in Intel manual, May'18, Volume 1, Table 3-5.
   Since we only call this function for instruction operands,
   the CS rule does not apply.
   The ES rule applies to string instructions,
   but our model does not use this function
   to determine the ES segment for string instructions
   (which cannot be overridden,
   at least for the string instructions we currently support),
   so this function does not take the ES rule into account either.
   So the result is either SS or DS,
   based on whether the base register is one of rSP and rBP or not:
   this determination is made based on
   Intel manual, May'18, Volume 2, Table 2-1 if the address size is 16 bits,
   and Intel manual, May'18, Volume 2, Table 2-2 otherwise.
   However, when Mod is not 11b and R/M is 100b,
   the notation [--][--] in Table 2-2 indicates the use of a SIB byte:
   according to Intel manual, May'18, Volume 2, Table 2-3,
   when the Base field of the SIB byte is 100b,
   the base register is rSP,
   and thus in this case the default segment register is SS.
   </p>
   <p>
   Note that here we may recalculate the address size
   even if that has already been calculated as part of
   the decoding of the instruction whose operand we are accessing.
   Thus, it may be possible to optimize the overall code.
