 registers. An instruction cannot reference legacy high-bytes (for example: AH,
 BH, CH, DH) and one of the new byte registers at the same time (for example:
 the low byte of the RAX register). However, instructions may reference legacy
 low-bytes (for example: AL, BL, CL or DL) and new byte registers at the same
 time (for example: the low byte of the R8 register, or R8L). The architecture
 enforces this limitation by changing high-byte references (AH, BH, CH, DH) to
 low byte references (BPL, SPL, DIL, SIL: the low 8 bits for RBP, RSP, RDI and
 RSI) for instructions using a REX prefix.</blockquote>

 <p>In other words, without the REX prefix, indices 0-7 refer to byte registers
 AL, CL, DL, BL, AH, CH, DH, and BH, whereas with the REX prefix, indices 0-15
 refer to AL, CL, DL, BL, SPL, BPL, SIL, DIL, R8L, R9L, R10L, R11L, R12L, R13L,
 R14L, R15L. This applies to 64-bit mode.</p>

    <p><em>Because the upper 32 bits of 64-bit general-purpose registers are
    undefined in 32-bit modes, the upper 32 bits of any general-purpose
    register are not preserved when switching from 64-bit mode to a 32-bit
    mode (to protected mode or compatibility mode). Software must not depend on
    these bits to maintain a value after a 64-bit to 32-bit mode
    switch.</em></p>

    <p>This function is used both in 64-bit mode and in 32-bit mode. Since in
    32-bit mode the high 32 bits of general-purpose registers are not
    accessible, it is fine for this function to set those bits to 0, as opposed
    to, for example, setting them to undefined values as done by the semantic
    functions of certain instructions for certain flags. The switching from
    32-bit mode to 64-bit mode (when modeled) will set the high 32 bits of
    general-purpose registers to undefined values.</p>"

  Programming\):</p>

  <p><em>The MMX state consists of eight 64-bit registers \(MM0
through MM7\). These registers are aliased to the low 64-bits \(bits 0
through 63\) of floating-point registers R0 through R7 \(see Figure
12-1\). Note that the MMX registers are mapped to the physical
locations of the floating-point registers \(R0 through R7\), not to
the relative locations of the registers in the floating-point register
stack \(ST0 through ST7\). As a result, the MMX register mapping is
fixed and is not affected by value in the Top Of Stack \(TOS\) field
in the floating-point status word \(bits 11 through 13\).</em></p>

<p>From Section 12.2, Intel Manual, Volume 3 \(System Programming\)</p>:

<p><em>When a value is written into an MMX register using an MMX
instruction, the value also appears in the corresponding
floating-point register in bits 0 through 63. Likewise, when a
floating-point value written into a floating-point register by a x87
FPU, the low 64 bits of that value also appears in a the corresponding
MMX register.</em></p>

<p><em>The execution of MMX instructions have several side effects on
the x87 FPU state contained in the floating-point registers, the x87
FPU tag word, and the x87 FPU status word. These side effects are as
follows:</em></p>

<p><em>* When an MMX instruction writes a value into an MMX register,
at the same time, bits 64 through 79 of the corresponding
floating-point register are set to all 1s.</em></p>

<p><em>* When an MMX instruction \(other than the EMMS instruction\) is
executed, each of the tag fields in the x87 FPU tag word is set to 00B
\(valid\). \(See also Section 12.2.1, Effect of MMX, x87 FPU, FXSAVE,
and FXRSTOR Instructions on the x87 FPU Tag Word.\)</em></p>

<p><em>* When the EMMS instruction is executed, each tag field in the
x87 FPU tag word is set to 11B \(empty)\.</em></p>

<p><em>* Each time an MMX instruction is executed, the TOS value is
set to 000B.  Execution of MMX instructions does not affect the other
bits in the x87 FPU status word \(bits 0 through 10 and bits 14 and
15\) or the contents of the other x87 FPU registers that comprise the
x87 FPU state \(the x87 FPU control word, instruction pointer, data

  :short "An @('undef') field in the @('x86') state feeds unknown
  values to processor components that are undefined"

  :long "<p>The @('undef') field is used to feed unknown values to
processor components that are undefined, as per the Intel
specifications.  For example, the @('SF'), @('ZF'), @('AF'), and
@('PF') rflags are undefined after a @('MUL') instruction is
executed.</p>

<p>The principle behind the @('undef') field is quite like that of the
@('oracle') sub-field of the @('env') field \(see @(see
environment-field)\).  We describe our use of the @('undef') field by
comparing it to the @('oracle') sub-field.</p>

<p>For reasoning about programs that involve commonly occurring
\"undefined events\" \(like flag computations\), using the @('oracle')
sub-field can be quite tedious, since it has to be carefully
initialized; i.e., a list of appropriate \(symbolic or concrete\)
values has to be associated with the instruction pointer where any
such undefined event occurs.  Imagine doing that for @('SF'), @('ZF'),
@('AF'), and @('PF') every time a @('MUL') instruction is executed.
The reason why we need this initialization is because the only way to
access the @('oracle') is through the functions @(see pop-x86-oracle)
and @(see env-read); @('pop-x86-oracle') expects the @('oracle') to
contain information in a specific format, and @('env-read') will give
us nothing unless we put something in to begin with.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the @('undef') field doesn't require any such
initialization.  The @('undef') field contains a natural number that
is increased every time an undefined value is pulled for use \(using
the constrained function @('create-undef')\) from a pool of undefined
values; thus, every access of the @('undef') field causes it to
contain a new value which is used to seed a unique undefined
value. See @(see undef-read) for details.</p>

<p>There is a reason why we enforced that tediousness in the case of
the @('oracle') sub-field: it provides a way of tracking any
computation that relies on the @('env') field. Such computations don't
happen often, and when they do, it'd probably be better if we knew
exactly what we are expecting from the environment.  Initializing the
@('oracle') is a way of expressing these expectations. However, in the
case of undefined values, we aren't really expecting anything from the
environment.  All we want is a sort of infinite pool of arbitary
values, seeded from @('undef') in our case, that we don't know
anything about.  As such, we wouldn't be able to prove that a value
obtained from @('undef') is equal \(or not\) to any other value,
either obtained from @('undef') or not.  This is exactly what we need
when reasoning about undefined values --- an undefined value is
different from another undefined value, and also all the known
values.</p>"
