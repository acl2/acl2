(ld "cert.acl2")

; (Matt K. mod):
; Turning off waterfall-parallelism because of the use of (logbitp-reasoning)
; in the proof of rflags-slice-ac-simplify.  It could be turned off for just
; that theorem, but here we prevent future possible failures of that computed
; hint, which returns a value, when waterfall-parallelism is active.

; Computed hint LOGBITP-REASONING modifies state:
#+acl2-par
(set-waterfall-parallelism nil)
