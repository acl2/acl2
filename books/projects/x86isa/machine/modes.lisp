  "<p>
  Given the modeling assumption stated in @(see x86-modes),
  this predicate discriminates between
  64-bit mode and the other two modes (collectively, 32-bit mode).
  Based on Intel manual, Mar'17, Vol. 3A, Sec. 2.2 (near Fig. 2-3),
  the discrimination is based on the IA32_EFER.LME and CS.L bits:
  if they are both 1, we are in 64-bit mode,
  otherwise we are in 32-bit mode
  (protected mode if IA32_EFER.LME is 0,
             compatibility mode if IA32_EFER.LME is 1 and CS.L is 0;
             note that when IA32_EFER.LME is 0, CS.L should be 0,
             according to Intel manual, Mar'17, Vol. 3A, Sec. 3.4.5).
  </p>
  <p>
  This predicate does not include state invariants such as
  the constraints imposed by the 64-bit mode consistency checks
  described in Intel manual, Mar'17, Vol. 3A, Sec. 9.8.5.
  </p>
  <p>
  This predicate is useful as a hypothesis of theorems
  about either 64-bit or 32-bit mode.
  </p>
  <p>
  Since @('(xr :msr ... x86)') returns a 64-bit value
  but the IA32_EFER register consists of 12 bits.
  So we use @(tsee n12) to make @('ia32_eferBits') functions applicable.
