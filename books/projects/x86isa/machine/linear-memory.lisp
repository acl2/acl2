  :long "<p>First, a quick note about virtual, linear, and physical
  addresses:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Linear (or Virtual) Address:</i> In the flat memory model (see
Intel Vol. 1, Section 3.3.1), memory appears to a program as a single,
continuous address space, called a linear (or virtual) address
space. An address for any byte in linear address space is called a
linear address.  When paging is disabled, then a linear address is the
same as a physical address.</li>

<li><i>Physical Address:</i> The memory that the processor addresses
on its bus is called physical memory. Physical memory is organized as
a sequence of 8-bit bytes. Each byte is assigned a unique address,
called a physical address. When employing the processor's memory
management facilities, programs do not directly address physical
memory.</li>

;; Writing canonical address to memory:

;; A short note on why I couldn't make do with wiml64 to write a
;; canonical address to the memory:

;; Here's a small, compelling example.  The following is some
;; information provided by profile when running fib(24); here, wiml64
;; was used to store a canonical address in the memory in the
;; specification of the CALL (#xE8) instruction.

;; (defun X86ISA::X86-CALL-E8-OP/EN-M calls     7.50E+4
;; ...
;; Heap bytes allocated                         4.80E+6; 33.3%
;; Heap bytes allocated per call                64

;; So, for fib(24), 4,801,792 bytes are allocated on the heap!  And
;; this is with paging turned off.

;; The reason why wiml64 uses such a lot of memory is because it
;; creates bignums all the time.  But when I have to store a canonical
;; address in the memory, I *know* that I'm storing a quantity lesser
;; than 64-bits.  Thus, I use write-canonical-address-to-memory to
;; avoid the creation of bignums.  Like the other rm* and wm*
;; functions, I have an MBE inside write-canonical-address-to-memory,
;; where the :logic part is defined in terms of WB.

;; Note that write-canonical-address-to-memory is optimized in the
;; application-level view only --- in the system-level mode, it's
;; merely a call of wml64.
