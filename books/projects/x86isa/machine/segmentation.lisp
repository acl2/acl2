  "<p>
   The segment is the one in the given segment register.
   </p>
   <p>
   Base addresses coming from segment descriptors are always 32 bits:
   see Intel manual, Mar'17, Vol. 3A, Sec. 3.4.5
   and AMD manual, Apr'16, Vol. 2, Sec. 4.7 and 4.8.
   However, in 64-bit mode, segment bases for FS and GS are 64 bits:
   see Intel manual, Mar'17, Vol. 3A, Sec. 3.4.4
   and AMD manual, Apr'16, Vol. 2, Sec 4.5.3.
   As an optimization, in 64-bit mode,
   since segment bases for CS, DS, SS, and ES are ignored,
   this function just returns 0 as the base result under these conditions.
   In 64-bit mode, when the segment register is FS or GS,
   we read the base address from the MSRs
   mentioned in Intel manual, Mar'17, Vol. 3A, Sec. 3.4.4
   and AMD manual, Apr'16, Vol. 2, Sec 4.5.3;
   these are physically mapped to the relevant hidden portions of FS and GS,
   so it should be a state invariant that they are equal to
   the relevant hidden portions of FS and GS.
   In 32-bit mode, since the high 32 bits are ignored
   (see Intel manual, Mar'17, Vol. 3A, Sec. 3.4.4
   and AMD manual, Apr'16, Vol. 2, Sec 4.5.3),
   we only return the low 32 bits of the base address
   read from the hidden portion of the segment register.
   </p>
   <p>
   @('*hidden-segment-register-layout*') uses 32 bits
   for the segment limit,
   which is consistent with the 20 bits in segment descriptors
   when the G (granularity) bit is 1:
   see Intel manual, Mar'17, Vol. 3A, Sec. 3.4.5
   and AMD manual, Apr'16, Vol. 2, Sec. 4-7 and 4-8.
   Thus, the limit is an unsigned 32-bit integer.
   </p>
   <p>
   The lower bound is 0 for code segments, i.e. for the CS register.
   For data (including stack) segments,
   i.e. for the SS, DS, ES, FS, and GS registers,
   the lower bound depends on the E bit:
   if E is 0, the lower bound is 0;
   if E is 1, the segment is an expand-down data segment
   and the lower bound is one plus the segment limit.
   See Intel manual, Mar'17, Vol. 3A, Sec. 3.4.5
   and AMD manual, Apr'16, Vol. 2, Sec. 4.7 and 4-8.
   Since the limit is an unsigned 32-bit (see above),
   adding 1 may produce an unsigned 33-bit result.
   Even though this should not actually happen with well-formed segments,
   this function returns an unsigned 33-bit integer as the lower bound result.
   As an optimization, in 64-bit mode,
   since segment limits and bounds are ignored,
   this function returns 0 as the lower bound;
   the caller must ignore this result in 64-bit mode.
   </p>
   <p>
   The upper bound is the segment limit for code segments,
   i.e. for the CS register.
   For data (including stack) segments,
   i.e. for the SS, DS, ES, FS, and GS registers,
   the upper bound depends on the E and D/B bits:
   if E is 0, the upper bound is the segment limit;
   if E is 1, the segment is an expand-down data segment
   and the upper bound is 2^32-1 if D/B is 1, 2^16-1 if D/B is 0.
   See Intel manual, Mar'17, Vol. 3A, Sec. 3.4.5
   and AMD manual, Apr'16, Vol. 2, Sec. 4.7 and 4-8.
   Since  the limit is an unsigned 32-bit (see above),
   this function returns an unsigned 32-bit integer as the upper bound result.
   As an optimization, in 64-bit mode,
   since segment limits and bounds are ignored,
   this function returns 0 as the upper bound;
   the caller must ignore this result in 64-bit mode.

  :long
  "<p>
   This translation is illustrated in Intel manual, Mar'17, Vol. 3A, Fig. 3-5,
   as well in AMD mamual, Oct'2013, Vol. 1, Fig. 2-3 and 2-4.
   In addition to the effective address,
   this function takes as input (the index of) a segment register,
   whose corresponding segment selector, with the effective address,
   forms the logical address that is turned into the linear address.
   </p>
   <p>
   This translation is used:
   when fetching instructions,
   in which case the effective address is in RIP, EIP, or IP;
   when accessing the stack implicitly,
   in which case the effective address is in RSP, ESP, or SP;
   and when accessing data explicitly,
   in which case the effective address is calculated by instructions
   via @(tsee x86-effective-addr).
   In the formal model,
   RIP contains a signed 48-bit integer,
   RSP contains a signed 64-bit integer,
   and @(tsee x86-effective-addr) returns a signed 64-bit integer:
   thus, the guard of this function requires @('eff-addr')
   to be a signed 64-bit integer.
   In 64-bit mode, the caller of this function supplies as @('eff-addr')
   the content of RIP,
   the content of RSP,
   or the result of @(tsee x86-effective-addr).
   In 32-bit mode, the caller of this function supplies as @('eff-addr')
   the unsigned 32-bit or 16-bit truncation of
   the content of RIP (i.e. EIP or IP),
   the content of RSP (i.e. ESP or SP),
   or the result of @(tsee x86-effective-addr);
   the choice between 32-bit and 16-bit is determined by
   default address size and override prefixes.
   </p>
   <p>
   This function also takes as input the number of bytes
   that have to be read or written starting from the effective address;
   that is, the chunk of bytes to be accessed
   goes from @('eff-addr') to @('eff-addr + nbytes - 1'), both inclusive.
   In 32-bit mode, the @('eff-addr') (the start of the chunk)
   is checked against the lower bound of the segment,
   and @('eff-addr + nbytes - 1') (the end of the chunk)
   is checked against the upper bound of the segment.
   In 64-bit mode, these checks are skipped.
   It is not clear from the Intel and AMD manuals
   whether the calculation @('eff-addr + nbytes - 1') should be modular.
   If it were, the wrap-around would give rise to
   two separate chunks of bytes to be checked for containment in the segment.
   According to the article at
   <a href=\"https://www.embedded.com/electronics-blogs/significant-bits/4024943/Taming-the-x86-beast\">@('https://www.embedded.com/electronics-blogs/significant-bits/4024943/Taming-the-x86-beast')</a>,
   the calculation does not wrap around.
   This is a paragraph from the article:
   <blockquote>
   <i>
   You also can't ``wrap around'' the end of segment like before.
   Earlier x86 chips with their 64KB segments allowed pointers
   to roll over from FFFF to 0000 automatically.
   Programs that accidentally (or purposely) ran off the end of a segment
   started over at the beginning.
   Programs that run off the end of a segment
   now are greeted with a segmentation fault.
   </i>
   </blockquote>
   So for now we make the stricter check
   by calculating @('eff-addr + nbytes - 1') non-modularly
   and therefore always having one chunk to check.
   Note that operations like @(tsee rme-size) always access one contiguous chunk
   because they forward the translated addresses
   to operations like @(tsee rml-size);
   so if it turned out that @('eff-addr + nbytes - 1') can wrap around
   (contrary to what the aforementioned article states),
   changes may need to be made
   in @(tsee rme-size) and similar operations as well.
   </p>
   <p>
   In 32-bit mode,
   the effective address is added to the base address of the segment;
   the result is truncated to 32 bits,
   because the addition should be modulo 2^32,
   given that the result must be 32 bits
   (cf. aforementioned figures in Intel and AMD manuals).
   In 64-bit mode,
   the addition of the base address of the segment is performed
   only if the segments are in registers FS and GS;
   the result is truncated to 64 bits,
   because the addition should be modulo 2^64,
   given that the result must be 32 bits
   (cf. aforementioned figures in Intel and AMD manuals);
   since in our model addresses are signed,
   we use @('i64') instead of @('n64') to perform this truncation.
   </p>
   <p>
   If the translation is successful,
   this function returns a signed 64-bit integer
   that represents a <i>canonical</i> linear address.
   In 64-bit mode, when the segment register is not FS or GS, the effective
   address is returned unmodified as a linear address, because segment
   translation should be a no-op in this case; otherwise, the effective address
   is translated to a linear address.  In both cases, this linear address is
   checked to be canonical; if not, an error flag is returned, otherwise, a
   canonical linear address is returned.
   In 32-bit mode, the 32-bit linear address that results from the translation
   is always canonical.
   If the translation fails,
   including the check that the linear address is canonical,
   a non-@('nil') error flag is returned,
   which provides some information about the failure.
   </p>
   <p>
   As explained in Intel manual, May'18, Volume 3, Sections 3.4.2 and 5.4.1,
   a null segment selector can be loaded into DS, ES, FS, and GS,
   but then a memory access through these segment registers causes a #GP.
   According to AMD manual, Dec'17, Volume 2, Section 4.5.1,
   a null segment selector has SI = TI = 0,
   but no explicit constraint is stated on RPL;
   Intel manual, May'18, Volume 2, POP specification says that
   a null segment selector has a value from 0 to 3,
   from which we infer that a null segment selector may have a non-zero RPL.
   In this function,
   we return an error if the visible portion of the segment register is 0-3,
   and the segment register is not CS or SS.
   Loading a null segment selector into CS and SS is not allowed,
   so it is a state invariant that
   CS and SS do not contain null segment selectors.
   The null segment selector check is skipped in 64-bit mode
   (see Intel manual, May'18, Volume 3, Section 5.4.1.1).

;; QUESTION:

;; FS and GS segments are given special treatment in that their base
;; addresses are allowed to be non-zero in 64-bit mode.  The hidden
;; portions of the FS and GS registers are mapped to the
;; model-specific registers IA32_FS_BASE and IA32_GS_BASE,
;; respectively---specifically, these registers contain the segment
;; base address.  My question is:

;; 1. When the FS or GS selector is updated to point to a data-segment
;; descriptor in GDT or LDT, is the base address from the descriptor
;; used to update these model-specific registers?

;; 2. Or is the base address in the descriptor ignored completely and
;; we have to update the model-specific registers separately to
;; provide a base address for FS or GS?

;; ======================================================================

;; [TO-DO@Shilpi]: I've written the following predicates by referring
;; to the AMD manuals.  Turns out that segmentation differs
;; significantly in Intel and AMD machines.  Intel defines more fields
;; in the descriptors to be available in 64-bit mode than AMD.  Also,
