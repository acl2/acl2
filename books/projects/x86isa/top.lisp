  :short "High-level information about these books"

  :long "<p>These books contain the specification of x86 instruction
set architecture \(ISA\); we characterize x86 machine instructions and
model the instruction fetch, decode, and execute process using the
ACL2 theorem-proving system.  We use our x86 ISA specification to
formally verify x86 machine-code programs.</p>

<p>These books include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A formal, executable x86 ISA model \(see machine directory\)</li>
<li>General theorems to aid in machine-code verification \(see
proofs/utilities directory\)</li>
<li>Proofs of properties of various programs \(see proofs directory\)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some important factors that influenced almost every choice
  we made while developing these books.</p>

<ul>

<li>

<b>Completeness of the x86 Model:</b> <p>The utility of a formal ISA
model for performing machine-code verification depends directly on the
model's completeness \(with respect to the ISA features specified\),
accuracy, and reasoning and execution efficiency.  <a
href='http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html'>Intel
software developer's manuals</a> were used as specification documents,
and ambiguities were resolved by cross-referencing <a
href='http://developer.amd.com/resources/documentation-articles/developer-guides-manuals/'>AMD
manuals</a> and running tests on real machines to understand processor
behavior.  There are a multitude of features in the x86 ISA that
include those left over from its early days to ensure backward
compatibility.  Although formally specifying the x86 ISA in its
entirety would be ideal, the focus of these books is the 64-bit
sub-mode of Intel's IA-32e mode --- most modern software relies on
64-bit computing anyway. Some components of the x86 ISA state that
need to be modeled are as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>General-purpose registers \(e.g., @('rax'), @('rbx'), etc.\),
segment registers \(e.g., @('cs'), @('ss'), etc.\), machine-specific
registers \(e.g., @('ia32\_efer'), @('ia32\_fs\_base'), etc.\),
etc.</li>

<li>64-bit instruction pointer @('rip')</li>

<li>64-bit flags @('rflags')</li>

<li>Memory management registers \(e.g., @('ldtr'), @('gdtr')\)</li>

<li>Physical and linear memory address space</li>

</ul>

<p>Other capabilities that are supported include all the addressing
modes, memory management via paging and segmentation, and the
instruction fetch-decode-execute cycle.</p>

</li>

<li>
<b>Reasoning <i>and</i> Execution Efficiency:</b> <p>These books
contain a formal x86 ISA model that is not only capable of reasoning
about x86 machine-code programs, but also of simulating those
programs.  Reasoning efficiency is desirable to make code proofs
tractable \(and we need all the help we can get for performing code
proofs!\) and execution efficiency is desirable to enable faster model
validation via co-simulations \(See @(see model-validation) for
details.\).</p>

<p>However, simple definitions that are suitable for reasoning
typically offer poor execution performance and definitions optimized
for execution efficiency often use a sufficiently different algorithm
from the one used in the specification that they are difficult to
reason about.  However, ACL2 offers several features to mitigate this
trade-off between reasoning and execution efficiency.  For e.g.: @(see
mbe) and its friends like @(see acl2::mbt), and @(see acl2::assert*),
@(see acl2::stobj), and @(see acl2::defabsstobj).</p>

<p>ACL2 features like abstract stobjs and @('assert*') were a response
by the ACL2 authors to provide mechanisms to mitigate the complexity
of reasoning vs. execution efficiency that came up over the course of
this project.  This x86 ISA model uses abstract stobjs to layer the
state of the x86 machine such that the lower layer \(i.e., the
concrete stobj\, see @(see x86-concrete-state)\) can be optimized for
execution efficiency and the upper layer \(i.e., the abstract stobj,
see @(see x86-abstract-state)\) can be optimized for reasoning
efficiency, while a correspondence theorem is proved to hold between
these two layers at all times.  Therefore, we get the benefit of both
fast execution and effective reasoning.</p>
</li>

<li>

<b>Level of Reasoning:</b> <p>The complexity of the x86 ISA model will
increase as more features are added to it, and this added complexity
will make reasoning inevitably more involved.  The issue of balancing
<i>verification effort</i> and <i>verification utility</i> is a very
pertinent one.  For example, users might not want to reason about an
application program at the level of physical memory, i.e., taking into
account address translations and access rights management provided by
the memory management data structures.  This is because it is
customary for application programs not to have direct access to the
system data structures.  The memory model seen by application programs
is that of linear memory, which is an OS-constructed abstraction of
the complicated underlying memory management mechanisms like paging
and segmentation that are based on physical memory.  Therefore,
verification of application programs can be performed at the level of
linear memory, if the OS routines that manage the linear memory
abstraction can be either trusted or proved correct.  However, the
verification of system programs, like kernel routines, must
necessarily be done at the level of physical memory since these
programs can access/modify system data structures.</p>

<p>In light of the above, the x86 ISA model provides the option to
deactivate some features of the ISA, enabling the user to do two kinds
of analysis, depending on the kind of programs being considered for
verification.  Specifically, the x86 model has the following modes of
operation:</p>

<ol>

<li><b>Programmer-level Mode:</b> <p>This mode of the model attempts
to provide the same environment for reasoning as is provided by an OS
for programming.  It allows the verification of an application program
while assuming that memory management, I/O operations, and services
offered via system calls are provided reliably by the underlying OS.
The memory model in this mode supports 64-bit linear addresses
specified for IA-32e machines.  A specification of system calls like
@('read'), @('write'), @('open'), and @('close') is also included in
the programmer-level mode.</p></li>

<li><b>System-level Mode:</b> <p>This mode includes the specification
  for IA-32e paging and segmentation; in particular, ISA-prescribed
  data structures for memory management are available in this mode.
  The memory model in this mode characterizes a 52-bit physical
  address space, which is the largest physical address space provided
  by modern x86 implementations.  This mode is intended to be used to
  simulate and verify software that has supervisor privileges and
  interacts with I/O devices.</p> </li>

</ol>

<p>An added benefit of having two separate modes of operation is the
increased execution speed of programs in the programmer-level mode;
this is because executing these programs in this mode does not require
simulating both the physical address space \(and hence,
accesses/updates to the paging and segmentation data structures\) and
the linear address space.</p>

<p>It would be beneficial, not to mention interesting, to verify
whether the programmer-level mode is an abstraction of the
system-level mode, given that the system data structures have been set
up correctly.  As of now, establishing this relationship between the
two modes is out of the scope of this project.</p>

  :short "Building books related to the x86 ISA and the machine-code
  analysis framework"

  :long "<p>The authors of these books generally prefer to use ACL2(p) for
certification, but of course, you are free to use ACL2.</p>

<p>Two ways of building the X86ISA books are:</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>Using the Makefile provided with the X86ISA books: Users of these
books who wish to simulate x86 programs with non-deterministic
computations like @('SYSCALL') \(in @(see programmer-level-mode)\) and
@('RDRAND') should use this Makefile and run make with
@('X86ISA_EXEC') set to @('t') \(which is the default value\).</p>

<code>
make JOBS=8 \\
     X86ISA_EXEC=t \\
     ACL2=/Users/shilpi/acl2/saved_acl2
</code>
<p>where the number of jobs to be run in parallel in this example is
8.  Note that we use @('JOBS') here instead of the @('-j') flag.</p>

<p>When @('X86ISA_EXEC') is @('t'), some dynamic C libraries that are
used in the model for supporting the execution of @('SYSCALL') in the
programmer-level mode and @('RDRAND') will be built.  <b>Since we rely
on the foreign function interface of <a
href='http://ccl.clozure.com/'>Clozure CL</a> (CCL), full execution
support is available only if you use CCL.</b></p>

<p>Values of @('X86ISA_EXEC') other than @('t') will not allow the
execution of @('SYSCALL') and @('RDRAND') instructions \(as may be the
case with using other Lisps as well\).  Note that reasoning about
these instructions will still be possible.  Execution and reasoning
about all other instructions will always be possible, irrespective of
@('X86ISA_EXEC') or the underlying Lisp.</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> You should do a \"make clean\" \(or \"make
execclean\" if you are in a hurry\) if you wish to certify the books
with a different value of @('X86ISA_EXEC').</p>

</li>

<li> <p>Using the \"everything\" target of the ACL2 Community
Books (see acl2/books/GNUmakefile): This is essentially the same as
executing @('cert.pl books/projects/x86isa/top'). This will build the
x86 books without full execution support, i.e., the effect will be the
same as building these books with @('X86ISA_EXEC=nil'), even though
the Makefile provided with the X86ISA books will not be used.</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>Suppose you had certified these books previously, but you have
since forgotten whether you built them with @('X86ISA_EXEC=t') or not.
Here is a way of checking the certified books to see if you have full
execution support. Look at the following file:
@('machine/x86-syscalls.cert.out'). If this file contains the
following: </p>

<code>X86ISA_EXEC Warning: x86-environment-and-syscalls-raw.lsp is not
included.</code>

<p>then you do <i>not</i> have @('SYSCALL') execution support.
Otherwise, you do. If, in @('machine/x86-other-non-det.cert.out'), you
find the following string, then you do <i>not</i> have @('RDRAND')
execution support, either because the books were certified with
@('X86ISA_EXEC') not equal to @('t') or because your processor does
not support the @('RDRAND') instruction:</p>

<code>X86ISA_EXEC Warning: x86-other-non-det-raw.lsp is not
included.</code>
