; books directory books/projects/sat/proof-checker-itp13/.  Here we accommodate
; a more recent input proof format to speed up unit propagation and add
; deletion (to obtain a DRAT checker).

; This modification of the list-based lrat-checker.lisp uses stobjs to speed up
; the handling of assignments, in particular, evaluation of literals and
; clauses.  It provides a slight modification of
; ../stobj-based/lrat-checker.lisp; here we assume that each clause in a proof
; file is sorted except perhaps for the first literal.
