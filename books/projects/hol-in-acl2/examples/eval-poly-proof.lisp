; The goal in this book is to prove the goal (DEFGOAL EVAL_SUM_POLY_DISTRIB
; ...) from eval-poly-thy.lisp, which is a file produced with a translator from
; HOL to ACL2 written by Konrad Slind.  That goal is stated in the ZF package
; as the final theorem, hol::HOL{EVAL_SUM_POLY_DISTRIB}, in the present book.

; Actually, this is a theorem when the HP-IMPLIES call is replaced by its
; second argument, i.e., the HP= call.  That's what we'll prove as the
; penultimate theorem in the present book, EVAL_SUM_POLY_DISTRIB-main.

; Those theorems are a bit of a nightmare to read, but we can get a prettier
; picture as follows.

;  (include-book "../acl2/hol-pprint")
;  (include-book "eval-poly-thy")
;  (in-package "HOL")

; And then, applying hol-pprint to the quotation of the HP= call in those
; returns:

#|
(EQUAL (= (EVAL_POLY (SUM_POLYS X Y) V)
          (+ (EVAL_POLY X V) (EVAL_POLY Y V)))
       HP-TRUE)
|#

; So what is our proof strategy?  First we include the following two books.

; Define eval_poly in HOL, towards the main goal, to prove that it distributes
; over sum.
(include-book "eval-poly-thy")

; Define eval-poly in ACL2 and prove that it distributes over sum.  That proof
; is automatic, i.e., it requires no lemmas.
(include-book "eval-poly-acl2")

; Include a book of general lemmas, developed during the proof below but
; reusable for other such proofs.
(include-book "../acl2/lemmas")

; Include the set-theory library.
(include-book "projects/set-theory/top" :dir :system)

; Include a book of helpful alternatives to generated lemmas.
(include-book "eval-poly-thy-alt")

; Then we reduce calls of HOL eval_poly and sum_polys to respective calls of
; ACL2 eval-poly and sum-polys, to reduce the main goal to the one already
; proved for ACL2.

; We start with a convenient abbreviation:
