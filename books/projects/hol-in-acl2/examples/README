Each example E is associated with the following files.
- ../hol4/E.sml is the code for translating the HOL4 version of E to
  ACL2.
- E-thy.lisp contains the ACL2 code resulting from running the above
  translator code.

In particular:

File ../hol4/ex1.sml is the code for translating some basic HOL4
definitions and theorems to ACL2, and ex1-thy.lisp is the result of
that translation.  The latter has a simple example of a theorem at the
end corresponding to an earlier defhol form with the keyword, :goal.

File ../hol4/eval-poly.sml is the code for translating a simple
formalizatino of a HOL4 polynomial evaluator and associated goal
theorem, and eval-poly-thy.lisp is the result of that translation.
The book eval-poly-acl2.lisp is a corresponding ACL2 formalization.
In the book eval-poly-proof.lisp is a proof of the HOL4 goal theorem
that uses that ACL2 formalization, to support the result in the
top-level book, eval-poly-top.lisp.  See also
eval-poly-thy-exports.lisp for theorems exported into ACL2 by the
translation of the HOL formalization into defhol forms, as produced by
the call of (close-theory) in eval-poly-thy.lisp.

The book example-simple.lisp is an early demonstration of the defhol
macro.
