; This book provides a nice presentation of the result proved in
; eval-poly-proof.lisp.  See that book for comments.  Here we include
; non-locally only the translated HOL development from eval-poly-thy.lisp,
; exhibiting the desired theorem proved from that translated HOL development.

; See eval-poly-proof.lisp for comments about the proof, in particular about
; how to view the main result as a formalization of this prettier statement.
