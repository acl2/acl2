    "The starting point is an anchor, @('current-anchor')
     and an even round, @('previous-round'), that precedes the anchor.
     The recursion terminates when @('previous-round')
     reaches the last committed round:
     we return a singleton list with the current anchor.
     The last committed round is passed as input @('last-committed-round');
     it is initially 0, when there is no committed round yet.
     If @('previous-round') is larger than the @('last-committed-round'),
     we find the leader at @('previous-round'),
     and we use @(tsee path-to-author+round) to find the anchor, if any,
     at @('previous-round') reachable from the current anchor.
     If there is no such reachable previous anchor,
     including the possibility that
     there is no leader because the committee is empty
     (although this never happens, due to invariants proved elsewhere),
     we recursively examine the even round
     just before @('previous-round'),
     with the same @('current-anchor');
     in the recursion, we will be looking for longer paths,
     from the same @('current-anchor') to a round further behind.
     If there is an anchor at @('previous-round'),
     it becomes the new @('current-anchor'),
     and we recursively examine its previous even round,
     but since we changed @('current-anchor'),
     in the recursion DAG paths will be from the new @('current-anchor').
     The recursive call will return a list of anchors
     that includes the anchor passed as first argument.
     thus, when that anchor changes (i.e. when the previous anchor is found),
     we add the old @('current-anchor') to the list.
     The resulting list of anchors is in inverse chronological order:
     the leftmost anchor is the newest one (i.e. greatest round number);
     the rightmost anchor is the oldest one (i.e. smallest round number).")

    "Since @('previous-round') eventually reaches @('last-committed-round')
     (at the end of the recursion),
     which is a natural number (i.e. a round number or 0),
     the @('previous-round') input of this ACL2 function
     is also a natural number (i.e. a round number or 0).")
   (xdoc::p
    "In order to calculate the leader at @('previous-round'),
     as it may also change during the recursion,
     we need to know the active committee at that round.
     So we pass the blockchain so far as an input to this function,
     and we require in the guard that the active committee
     is known at @('previous-round'),
     which implies that it is also known at smaller rounds.
     Note that the @('blockchain') input does not change in the recursion:
     it is simply the current blockchain,
     which this operation is not extending;
     this operation is just collecting the anchors
     with which the blockchain is (elsewhere) extended.
     It is an invariant, proved elsewhere,
     that @('last-committed-round') is in fact the round of the latest block
     (or 0 if the blockchain is empty).")

     (i.e. the @(tsee car) of @(tsee last), i.e. the rightmost one)
     is above the last committed round.
     This assumption is satisfied when this function is called.
     Note that, since we also proved that rounds are strictly increasing,
     proving that the rightmost anchor has round above the last committed one
     implies that all the other anchors do as well;
     but in any case we need the theorem in this form,

    "The first theorem says that
     the anchors collected, starting from an anchor,
     from a backward-closed subset of an unequivocal DAG
     are the same in the superset.
     The anchor collection in question is the one
     expressed by the @(tsee collect-anchors) operation,
     which collects anchors starting from a given one
     down to a given round (or 0 for all rounds).
     If the starting anchor is in the subset,
     it must also be in the superset,
     and collecting the anchors in the superset
     yields the same result as collecting the anchors in the subset.
     That is, the collection of anchors is stable under DAG growth.
     This builds on the stability property of paths under DAG growth,
     expressed by the theorem @('path-to-author+round-of-unequivocal-superdag')
     in @(see paths-in-unequivocal-closed-dags);
     the collection of anchors is based on the paths,
     both present and absent paths,
     which that theorem shows to be stable under DAG growth.
     The proof is fairly simple, by induction on @(tsee collect-anchors).")

    "The second theorem says that
     the anchors collected, starting from a common anchor,
     from two backward-closed, (individually and mutually) unequivocal DAGs
     are the same in the two DAGs.
     The proof is also by induction on @(tsee collect-anchors):
     although there are two calls with different arguments,
     the measured subset (i.e. @('previous-round')) is the same in both calls.
     We need more hypotheses (which are implied by already proved invariants),
     to ensure that the two blockchains result in the same committees,
     and thus in the same leaders at each round of interest."))
