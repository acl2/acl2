    "In typical BFT systems, which have fixed sets of validators,
     the notion of fault tolerance applies to the system as a whole,
     based on the (fixed) number of correct and faulty validators:
     the system is fault-tolerant if the actual number of faulty validators
     does not exceed @($f$), which is calculated from the total @($n$),
     as formalized in @(tsee max-faulty-for-total)
     (applied to numbers of validators instead of stake).
     With dynamic committees with stake, the notion applies to
     every committee that arises during the execution of the protocol,
     in terms of stake instead of numbers of validators.
     It has to be an assumption on every such committee:
     it cannot be checked by validators,

     the address is in the input set,
     and it is the address of a correct validator.
     We show that if this function returns @('nil'),
     then all the addresses are of faulty validators
     (expressed by saying that they have an empty intersection

     the input set is a subset of a fault-tolerant committee,
     and the total stake of validators is more than @($f$),
     i.e. the maximum tolerated stake of faulty validators
     (see @(tsee max-faulty-for-total)).
     The reason is that if @('pick-correct-validator') returned @('nil'),
     then, as proved in @('all-faulty-when-not-pick-correct-validator'),
     all the validators in @('vals') are faulty.
     But since we hypothesize that their stake is more than @($f$),
     and since the fault tolerance hypothesis means that
     the total stake of faulty validators is no more than @($f$),
     we have an impossibility.
     Thus @('pick-correct-validator') must return an address,
     which, as proved in the other theorems,
     is in @('vals') and is a correct validator.
     We use the @('committee-members-stake-monotone') theorem
     to inject the appropriate facts into the proof.
     Given that @('vals') is a subset of the committee members,
     but that @('vals') is disjoint from correct addresses
     (by @('all-faulty-when-not-pick-correct-validator'),
     we have that @('vals') is in fact a subset of
     the committee's faulty members,
     whose total stake does not exceed @($f$) by fault tolerance,
     and thus the total stake of @('vals') does not exceed @($f$) either,
     which contradicts the hypothesis that it does.")

    "A related fact, which we also prove,
     is that, if the committee is fault-tolerant and not-empty,
     and the validators' total stake is at least the quorum,
