     However, given that @(tsee collect-all-anchors)
     is stable under DAG extension as already proved
     in @('collect-all-anchors-of-unequivocal-superdag'),
     there is no change to the sequence of committed anchors.
     To discharge the hypothesis of that theorem,
     saying that the extended DAG is unequivocal,

    "A @('commit') event is the only kind
     that changes the sequence of committed anchors
     (for the target validator),
     by extending them with a suitable call of @(tsee collect-anchors).
     The proof takes a little work.
     We distinguish the case of the target validator
     from the case of another validator (which is easy),
     and within the first case we consider two sub-cases
     based on whether the last committed round was 0 or not.
     The case in which it is 0 is relatively simple,
     because the second argument of the @(tsee append) is @('nil'),
     since no anchors have been committed yet;
     we open @(tsee collect-all-anchors),
     and we need to simplify away the blockchain extension
     via the theorem @('collect-anchors-of-extend-blockchain-no-change'),
     which involved other rules to relieve its hypotheses.
     The sub-cases in which there are already some committed anchors
     is the more complex;
     the most important theorem used there is
     @(tsee collect-all-anchors-to-append-of-collect-anchors),
     and again we need rules to simplify away the blockchain extension.
     In both sub-cases, the blockchain extension arises
     from the definition of @(tsee committed-anchors).")
