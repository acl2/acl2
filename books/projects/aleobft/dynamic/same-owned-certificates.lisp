     Each validator has certificates in its DAG and buffer,

     all of these certificates are (actually or potentially) owned

    "An important invariant of the protocol is that
     validators always have the same set of owned certificates.
     Their DAGs and buffers may have (together) different certificates,
     but there will be messages in transit that ``fill the gap''.
     This is a consequence of our reliable broadcast model,
     in which a certificate's author broadcasts the certificate
     to all correct validators, except possibly itself if correct
     (because in that case the certificate is immediately added to the DAG).")

     so every validator owns the empty set.
     The only kind of event that changes the set is @('create-certificate'),
     but as already discussed the certificate is added
     to every validator's set of owned certificates.
     Other events only move certificates
     (from network to buffer, or from buffer to DAG),
     or do not touch them at all."))
