    "The starting point is an anchor, @('current-anchor')
     and an even round, @('previous-round'), that precedes the anchor.
     The recursion terminates when @('previous-round')
     reaches the last committed round:
     we return a singleton list with the current anchor.
     The last committed round is passed as input @('last-committed-round');
     it is initially 0, when there is no committed round yet.
     If @('previous-round') is larger than the @('last-committed-round'),
     we find the leader at @('previous-round'),
     and we use @(tsee path-to-author+round) to find the anchor, if any,
     at @('previous-round') reachable from the current anchor.
     If there is no such reachable previous anchor,
     we recursively examine the even round
     just before @('previous-round'),
     with the same @('current-anchor');
     in the recursion, we will be looking for longer paths,
     from the same @('current-anchor') to a round further behind.
     If there is an anchor at @('previous-round'),
     it becomes the new @('current-anchor'),
     and we recursively examine its previous even round,
     but since we changed @('current-anchor'),
     in the recursion DAG paths will be from the new @('current-anchor').
     The recursive call will return a list of anchors
     that includes the anchor passed as first argument.
     thus, when that anchor changes (i.e. when the previous anchor is found),
     we add the old @('current-anchor') to the list.
     The resulting list of anchors is in inverse chronological order:
     the leftmost anchor is the newest one (i.e. greatest round number);
     the rightmost anchor is the oldest one (i.e. smallest round number).")

     the @('previous-round') input of this ACL2 function

   (xdoc::p
    "In order to calculate the leader at @('previous-round'),
     as it may also change during the recursion,
     we need to know the active committee at that round.
     So we pass the blockchain so far as an input to this function,
     and we require in the guard that the active committee
     is known at @('previous-round'),
     which implies that it is also known at smaller rounds.
     Note that this @('blockchain') input does not change in the recursion:
     it is simply the current blockchain,
     which this operation is not extending;
     this operation is just collecting the anchors
     with which the blockchain is (elsewhere) extended.
     It should be an invariant (not captured here)
     that @('last-committed-round') is in fact the round of the latest block
     (or 0 if the blockchain is empty);
     we plan to prove this invariant, as done for
     the model of AleoBFT with static committees.")
