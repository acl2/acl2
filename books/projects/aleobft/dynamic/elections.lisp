     If all validators agree on the committee at that round
     (as we plan to prove as one of the key properties of the protocol),
     then they choose the same leader.
     Given this common leader, each validator uses
     the certificates at the immediately following odd round
     to carry out an election of that chosen leader:
     each certificate that references the leader certificate
     counts as a `yes' vote,
     while each certificate that references a different certificate
     counts as a `no' vote.
     If the validator has enough `yes' votes,
     which implies that it must have the leader certificate itself,
     which is called an `anchor', the validator commits that anchor,
     and potentially other precededing anchors,
     by generating blocks from them;
