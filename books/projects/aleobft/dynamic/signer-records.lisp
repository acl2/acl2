    "A signer of a certificate is either the author or an endorser.
     The author adds the certificate to its DAG as it creates the certificate,
     as defined in the transitions for @('create-certificate'),
     so it has a record of the certificate.
     As also defined in the transitions for @('create-certificate'),
     an endorser adds the certificate's author and round
     to the set of endorsed pair,
     which also constitutes a record of the certificate.
     Certificate creation also broadcasts the certificate to endorsers
     (as well as to other correct validators, except the author),
     so the endorser may receive the whole certificate at some point,
     via a @('receive-certificate') event,
     upon which it removes the author-round pair from the endorsed set,
     but it adds the whole certificate to the buffer,
     so it is still has a record of the certificate.
     A @('store-certificate') event may move the certificate
     from the buffer to the DAG,
     but again the endorser has thus a record of that certificate.
     Certificates are never removed from DAG by other events.")
   (xdoc::p
    "Thus, both in the case of the author and in the case of an endorser,
     the signer in question always has a record of the certificate,
     in its own validator state, in three possible forms:
     in the DAG (the whole certificate),
     or in the buffer (the whole certificate),
     or in the set of endorsed pairs (just author and round).")
   (xdoc::p
    "Note the difference between this notion and that of "
    (xdoc::seetopic "owned-certificates" "owned certificates")
    ": the latter consist of
     the certificates in the validator state
     or in transit in the network;
     these are all whole certificates,
     and apply to all correct validators.
     In contrast, certificate records are all in the validator state,
     but are not necessarily whole certificates
     (it could be just authors and rounds),
     and they only apply to the signers of the certificate.")
   (xdoc::p
    "It is tempting to formalize the notion of
     `a signer having a record of a certificate'
     as the disjunction of
     (i) the certificate is in the DAG of the signer,
     (ii) the certificate is in the buffer of the signer, and
     (iii) the author and round of the certificate form a pair
     in the set of endorsed pairs of the signer.
     However, this would be not quite preserved
     by @('receive-certificate') events.
     The validator receiving a certificate @('C')
     could already have a recordo of a certificate @('C0'),
     different from @('C') but with the same author and round,
     i.e. @('C.author = C0.author') and @('C.round = C0.round').
     This cannot happen because of non-equivocation,
     but we have not proved that yet,
     and in fact we need to use to use the notion of signer records
     to prove non-equivocation, so we cannot assume it here.
     The problem is that, upon receiving @('C'),
     if the record of @('C0') is in the set of endorsed pairs,
     and not in the DAG or in the buffer,
     the pair of the common author and round is removed from the set,
     and thus the validator no longer has a record of @('C0'),
     although it now has a record of @('C').
     So we need to weaken the notion of
     `a signer having a record of a certificate @('C')'
     to the disjunction of
     (i) the DAG of the signer has some certificate @('C\'')
     (the same as @('C') or not)
     with the author and round of @('C'),
     (ii) the buffer of the signer has some certificate @('C\'')
     (the same as @('C') or not)
     with the author and round of @('C'), and
     (iii) the author and round of @('C') form a pair
     in the set of endorsed pairs of the signer.
     This is the formulation we define and prove here."))
