    "In addition, if the certificate's round number is
     greater than the current round number plus one,
     the current round number is fast-forwarded to
     the certificate's round number minus one.
     The idea is that, if there are certificates,
     such as the one being stored in the DAG,
     which must necessarily come from another validator,
     which are two or more rounds ahead of the validator
     that is storing the certificate into the DAG,
     it indicates that this validator is behind.
     Note that, as required in @(tsee store-certificate-possiblep),
     the DAG must contain all the previous certificates,
     which must form a quorum because of the way certificates are created
     (it needs to be proved that there is agreement on the quorum,
     as we indeed plan to do);
     thus, if the validator's round is advanced to the certificate's round,
     the validator can immediately generate its own new certificate
     for that round in our model (or a proposal in a more detailed model).
     This aspect of the protocol needs further study,
     along with the logic for
     round advancement in @('advance-round') events.")

     Although the timer also needs further study,
     its purpose appears to be that a validator
     does not spend excessive time in a round,
     regardless of certificates received.
     In that case, it seems appropriate to reset the timer
     every time the round is advanced.")
