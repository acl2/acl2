    "Dynamic committees are one of the most distinctive features of AleoBFT.
     Starting with a genesis (i.e. initial) committee,
     validators join and leave the committe, by bonding and unbonding,
     which happens via transactions in the blockchain.
     Since every validator has its own view of the blockchain,
     it also has its own view of how the committees evolves.
     The agreement on the blockchains of the validators
     also provides an agreement on how the committee evolves,
     as proved in @(see same-committees).")
   (xdoc::p
    "In our model a committee consists of
     a non-empty set of validator addresses.
     We introduce a fixtype to wrap that, to enforce non-emptiness,
     and also for greater abstraction and extensibility.")

     but we introduce a slightly more abstract operation for that,
     also for future extensibility.")
   (xdoc::p
    "The genesis committee is arbitrary,
     but fixed for each execution of the protocol.
     Thus, we model the genesis committee via a constrained nullary function
     that returns the genesis committee.
     The genesis committee is globally known to all validators.")
   (xdoc::p
    "Each validator's view of the evolution of the committee
     is formalized via functions that operate on the blockchain,
     and that, starting with the genesis committee,
     calculate the committee at every block,
     by taking into considerations bonding and unbonding transactions.
     Blocks are produced at, and are associated with,
     (a subset of the) even rounds of the DAG.
     The notion of interest is that of the committee at a round,
     but this actually specializes into two notions,
     because of the committee lookback approach of AleoBFT.")
   (xdoc::p
    "One notion is that of the committee bonded at each round,
     i.e. the committee resulting from applying
     all the bonding and unbonding transactions up to that round
     to the genesis committee in order.
     There are actually two possible choices for defining this notion precisely,
     based on whether the committee bonded at an even round that has a block
     includes or excludes the transactions in that block.
     That is, do we consider the committee resulting at the end of that block
     to be the committee at that even round, or at the odd round that follows?
     The exact choice might affect the correctness properties,
     so we will need to be careful about the choice.")
   (xdoc::p
    "The other notion is that of the committee active at each round,
     i.e. the committee that is in charge of that round.
     This is the lookback committee: it is the bonded committee
     at a fixed number of previous rounds (``lookback'').
     The choice of when a bonded committee starts vs. ends discussed above
     affects the choice of when an active committee starts vs. ends,
     and that is what most directly may affect the correctness properties.")

   (xdoc::p
    "In order to maintain the non-emptiness of the committee,
     attempting to remove the only member of the committee
     does not actually remove it.
     An implementation of AleoBFT may require larger minimal committees,
     but for the purposes of our model,
     it suffices for the committee to be never empty.
     The protocol works, although in a degenerate way,
     with just one validator.")
   (xdoc::p
    "It is an interesting question whether an AleoBFT implementation
     should have mechanisms in place to guarantee minimal committee sizes.
     If it does, our model of unbonding captures a form of that.
     If it does not, which is plausible since validators
     should be generally free to bond and unbond as they want,
     then the whole network could be considered to fail
     if all validators unbond and there is nobody to run the network.
     If that is the case, our model of unbonding is still adequate to capture
     the situation in which the whole network has not failed;
     as mentioned above, the unbonding transaction that does not unbond
     can be simply regarded as if it were an @(':other') kind of transaction.")
   (xdoc::p
    "In order to maintain the fact that
     the committee is a subset of all the validators in the system,
     we pass to this function an input @('all-vals')
     that consists of the set of all validator addresses in the system.
     If a bonding transaction references an address outside that set,
     the committee is unchanged by that transaction,
     i.e. it is ignored.
     This is just a technical device in our formal model;
     it does not mean that validators need to know @('all-vals')
     in order to calculate committees.
     In an AleoBFT implementation,
     the existence of a bonding transaction with a certain address
     means that a validator with that address is part of the system,
     which in our model consists of all possible validators,
     and the one with that address is certainly a possibly validator.
     Thus, this is more of a constraint on
     the system of all validators
     than on the calculation of committees per se.")

     we have two choices for the bonded committee at round 2:

     to be bonded at the beginning or at the end of round 2.
     The same kind of choice applies to any other even round

     on the other hand, it is always clear

     according to the choice explained above,
     But note that not every round has a bonded committee:
     after a certain round, the bonded committee is unknown,
     because there are no blocks yet.
     Suppose that the last block is at (even) round @('R').
     Then we know the committee bonded at rounds @('R+1') and @('R+2'),
     namely the committee resulting from
     all the transactions in the blockchain.
     We also know the committee bonded at @('R') and earlier rounds,

     we stop the loop as soon as we find a block with round below @('round'):
     we calculate the committee from that block and preceding blocks,

     This relation works for every positive @($n$),
     whether it is a multiple of 3 or not.
     Multiplying both sides by 3, we get @($3f < n$),
     and taking @($f$) as the maximum value that satisfies the inequality
     (as opposed to potentially smaller values than the maximum),
     we get to the sometimes stated condition @($n = 3f + 1$),
     although this condition is less general for @($n$),

     The actual number of faulty validators
     is not something that validators know.
     In contrast, the total number @($n$) of validators is known,
     and thus the maximum @($f$) satisfying @($f < n/3$)
     can be calculated from @($n$).
     So when a validator needs to use @($f$) in some computation,
     it is the maximum such @($f$), calculable from @($n$),
     not the (unknowable to the validator) number of faulty validators.")

     as is the case for AleoBFT,
     it makes more sense for @($f$) to be the maximum value
     that satisfies the inequality,
     because it allows for the maximum possible number of faulty validators.
     So in our model @($f$) is always that maximum,
     and it is calculable from @($n$).")
   (xdoc::p
    "This ACL2 function performs this calculation.
     The input @('total') is @($n$),
     and the output is the maximum @($f$) such that @($f < n/3$).
     We define the function to return 0 if @($n = 0$),
     although @($n = 0$) does not correspond to a practical situation.
     So consider the normal case @($n > 0$)
     (we could strengthen the guard of this function
     to require a positive integer as input).
     If @($n$) is a multiple of 3,
     @($f$) is one less than the integer @($n/3$);
     if @($n$) is not a multiple of 3,
     @($f$) is the floor of @($n/3$).
     We can put the two cases together by noting that
     the ceiling of an integer is the integer (i.e. a no-op)
     and that the floor of a non-integer is
     one less than the ceiling of the non-integer.
     So we define @($f$) as
     one less than the ceiling of @($n/3$),
     or equivalently as the floor of @($(n-1)/3$).
     We prove the two equivalent, in fact.
     We also prove that this function returns something below @($n/3$),
     and one more is not below @($n/3$):
     that is, we prove that it returns the maximum.
     We could have alternatively defined this function in terms of maximum,
     via a recursion to find it, or even in a non-executable way,
     but instead we pick the definition with ceiling,
     and prove it equivalent to the other two possible definitions.
     We also prove that @($n \\geq 3f + 1$).")
   (xdoc::p
    "If @($n$) is 1 or 2 or 3, no failures are tolerated:
     @($f$), and hence @($f$), must be 0.
     The case @($n = 1$) is a degenerate one,
     but the protocol could probably still work in a degenerate way.
     The cases @($n = 2$) and @($n = 3$) could make sense,
     but since they tolerate no failures,
     they are not used in practice.
     If @($n$) is 4 or more, we can tolerate
     an increasing number of faulty validators,
     any number less than or equal to $f$,
     so that is usually the practical minimum for @($n$)."))
