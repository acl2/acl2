    "This is a fairly ubiquitous concept in BFT systems.
     This concept can be generally described like this:
     certain decisions are made (by correct validators)
     only if they are supported by a quorum of validators;
     contradictory decisions cannot be made because,
     because each decision would be supported by a quorum,
     but the intersection of the two quora would contain enough validators
     that there is at least a correct one in the intersection,
     which would not have supported both decisions.
     This is the case if the system is fault-tolerant,
     i.e. @($f < n/3$) (see @(tsee max-faulty-for-total)).")
   (xdoc::p
    "The quorum intersection argument is normally based on number of validators:
     both @($n$) and @($f$) measure numbers of validators.
     In AleoBFT, stake is used instead of numbers of validators:
     both @($n$) and @($f$) measure stake;
     see @(see fault-tolerance), as well as the functions
     @(tsee committee-max-faulty-stake) and @(tsee committee-quorum-stake).

     By requiring a quorum of signatures,
     where each signature supports the certificate
     (in the sense of `supporting' mentioned above),
     we ensure that two incompatible certificates,
     i.e. two different certificates with the same author and round,
     cannot exist because they would have to be both signed by
     at least one correct validator in the intersection of the quora;
     the intersection consists of stake (not numbers of validators),

     at least one correct validator in both quora.")

     and each set of addresses has at least the quorum stake,
     the function indeed picks a correct validator.
