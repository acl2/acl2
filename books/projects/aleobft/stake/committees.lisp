    "Dynamic committees are one of the most distinctive features of AleoBFT.
     Starting with a genesis (i.e. initial) committee,
     validators join and leave the committe, by bonding and unbonding,
     which happens via transactions in the blockchain.
     Since every validator has its own view of the blockchain,
     it also has its own view of how the committees evolves.
     The agreement on the blockchains of the validators
     also provides an agreement on how the committee evolves,
     as proved elsewhere.")
   (xdoc::p
    "In our model a committee consists of
     a finite map from validator addresses to their bonded stake,
     the latter expressed as a positive integer
     whose exact units is irrelevant (cf. @(tsee transaction)).
     We introduce a fixtype to wrap that,
     for greater abstraction and extensibility.")
   (xdoc::p
    "The genesis committee is arbitrary,
     but fixed for each execution of the protocol.
     Thus, we model the genesis committee via a constrained nullary function
     that returns the genesis committee.
     The genesis committee is globally known to all validators.")
   (xdoc::p
    "Each validator's view of the evolution of the committee
     is formalized via functions that operate on the blockchain,
     and that, starting with the genesis committee,
     calculate the committee at every block,
     by taking into considerations bonding and unbonding transactions.
     Blocks are produced at, and are associated with,
     (a subset of the) even rounds of the DAG.
     The notion of interest is that of the committee at a round,
     but this actually specializes into two notions,
     because of the committee lookback approach of AleoBFT.")
   (xdoc::p
    "One notion is that of the committee bonded at each round,
     i.e. the committee resulting from applying
     all the bonding and unbonding transactions up to that round
     to the genesis committee in order.
     There are actually two possible choices for defining this notion precisely,
     based on whether the committee bonded at an even round that has a block
     includes or excludes the transactions in that block.
     That is, do we consider the committee resulting at the end of that block
     to be the committee at that even round, or at the odd round that follows?
     The exact choice should not actually matter to correctness:
     so long as committees are used consistently,
     the two key intersection arguments for correctness,
     namely quorum intersection and successor-predecessor intersection,
     should work fine either way.")
   (xdoc::p
    "The other notion is that of the committee active at each round,
     i.e. the committee that is in charge of that round.
     This is the lookback committee: it is the bonded committee
     at a fixed number of previous rounds (``lookback'').
     The choice of when a bonded committee starts vs. ends discussed above
     affects the choice of when an active committee starts vs. ends.")

    "This ACL2 function returns the committee bonded at a given round,
     according to the choice explained above,
     But note that not every round has a bonded committee:
     after a certain round, the bonded committee is unknown,
     because there are no blocks yet.
     Suppose that the last block is at (even) round @('R').
     Then we know the committee bonded at rounds @('R+1') and @('R+2'),

     all the transactions in the blockchain.
     We also know the committee bonded at @('R') and earlier rounds,

     But we do not know the committee bounded at rounds @('R+3') and later,

     If the blockchain is empty, we know the bonded committee at rounds 1 and 2,
     namely the genesis committee;
     but we do not know the bonded committee at round 3 and later,
     because a block may be committed at round 2
     which determines a new bonded committee at round 3 (and 4).")
   (xdoc::p
    "So here is how this ACL2 function to calculate the bonded committee works.

     If the requested round (i.e. the @('round') input of this function)
     is more than 2 rounds later than @('L'),
     then the bonded committee is unknown, and we return @('nil').
     Recall that, as explained in @(tsee validator-state),
     the latest block is the leftmost, i.e. the @(tsee car).
     If instead the requested round is less than or equal to @('L+2'),

     This relation works for every positive @($n$),
     whether it is a multiple of 3 or not.
     Multiplying both sides by 3, we get @($3f < n$),
     and taking @($f$) as the maximum value that satisfies the inequality
     (as opposed to potentially smaller values than the maximum),
     we get to the sometimes stated condition @($n = 3f + 1$),
     although this condition is less general for @($n$),
     because it forces @($n$) to be one more than a multiple of 3.

     Furthermore, AleoBFT uses not numbers of validators,
     but units of stake associated to the validators;
     thus @($n$) is the sum of the units of stake
     of all the validators in the committee,
     and @($f$) is the sum of the units of stake
     of the faulty validators in the committee.")
   (xdoc::p
    "The distinction between the maximum @($f$)
     and possibly smaller values of @($f$)
     is worth emphasizing,
     because recent BFT literature
     does not always state things clearly in this respect.
     The stake associated to the faulty validators in a committee
     is not something that validators know,
     because validators do not know which validators are faulty.
     In contrast, the stake @($n$) associated to
     all the validators in a committee is known,
     because the committee is known (calculated from the blockchain).
     Thus the maximum @($f$) satisfying @($f < n/3$)
     can be calculated from @($n$).
     So when a validator needs to use @($f$) in some computation,
     it is the maximum such @($f$), calculable from @($n$),
     not the (unknowable to the validator)
     stake of the faulty validators in the committee.")
   (xdoc::p
    "Some BFT literature uses phrases like
     ``up to @($f < n/3$) faulty validators'',
     implying that @($f$) is another parameter of the system, besides @($n$).
     But when validators need to use @($f$) as part of their computation,
     as is the case for AleoBFT,
     it makes more sense for @($f$) to be the maximum value
     that satisfies the inequality,
     because it allows for the maximum possible stake faulty validators.
     So in our model @($f$) is always that maximum,
     and it is calculable from @($n$).")
   (xdoc::p
    "This ACL2 function performs this calculation.
     The input @('total') is @($n$),
     and the output is the maximum @($f$) such that @($f < n/3$).
     We define the function to return 0 if @($n = 0$),
     although @($n = 0$) does not correspond to a practical situation.
     So consider the normal case @($n > 0$).
     If @($n$) is a multiple of 3,
     @($f$) is one less than the integer @($n/3$);
     if @($n$) is not a multiple of 3,
     @($f$) is the floor of @($n/3$).
     We can put the two cases together by noting that
     the ceiling of an integer is the integer (i.e. a no-op)
     and that the floor of a non-integer is
     one less than the ceiling of the non-integer.
     So we define @($f$) as
     one less than the ceiling of @($n/3$),
     or equivalently as the floor of @($(n-1)/3$).
     We prove the two equivalent, in fact.
     We also prove that this function returns something below @($n/3$),
     and that one more than that is not below @($n/3$):
     that is, we prove that it returns the maximum.
     We could have alternatively defined this function in terms of maximum,
     via a recursion to find it, or even in a non-executable way,
     but instead we pick the definition with ceiling,
     and prove it equivalent to the other two possible definitions.
     We also prove that @($n \\geq 3f + 1$) when @($n \\neq 0$),
     that @($n \\geq f$) even if @($n = 0$),
     that @($n > f$) when @($n \\neq 0$),
     and that @($f < n - f$) when @($n \\neq 0$);
     in the latter, the significance of @($n - f$) is that
     it is the quorum, corresponding to @($f$),
     necessary for fault tolerance conditions.")
   (xdoc::p
    "If @($n$) is 1 or 2 or 3, no failures are tolerated:
     @($f$), and hence @($f$), must be 0.
     The case @($n = 1$) is a degenerate one,
     but the protocol could probably still work in a degenerate way.
     The cases @($n = 2$) and @($n = 3$) could make sense,
     but since they tolerate no failures,
     they are not used in practice.
     If @($n$) is 4 or more, we can tolerate
     an increasing amount of faulty validators,
     any amount whose stake is less than or equal to $f$,
     so that is usually the practical minimum for @($n$)."))
