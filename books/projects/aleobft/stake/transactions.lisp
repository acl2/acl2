    "However, most of these details are unimportant for our model.
     Our model is only concerned with two kinds of transactions:
     one to bond a validator
     (i.e. add the validator to the committee with some stake), and
     one to unbond a validator
     (i.e. remove the validator from the committee).
     So we consider these two kinds of transactions,
     plus an opaque one for all other kinds of transactions,
     and more in general the other kinds of transmissions mentioned above.
     We stick to the more common term `transaction' in our model,
     but one can imagine that the non-bonding and non-unbonding transactions
     (i.e. the third kind of transactions in our model)
     also captures solutions and ratifications in AleoBFT."))

    "Our model treats transactions as mostly opaque.
     Certain transactions bond and unbond validators,
     which is what makes the validator committee dynamic.
     So we model three kinds of transactions:
     bond a validator with a given amount of stake,
     unbond a validator,
     and something else that does not bond or unbond validators;
     we leave the details of third third kind open.")
   (xdoc::p
    "Stake is modeled as a positive integer,
     which can be imagined to be Aleo micro-credits,
     but the exact unit of stake is irrelevant to our model.
     A bonding transaction consists of
     the address of the validator and the stake bonded.
     An unbonding transaction consists of
     just the address of the validator;
     implicitly, the transaction unbonds all the bonded stake.
     As formalized elsewhere,
     in our model nothing prevents a block from including
     multiple transactions that bond and/or unbond the same validator,
     which have a net effect at the end of the block;
     this provides flexibility in modeling validators
     that change their stake as net effect in a block
     (regardless of whether the full AleoBFT puts restrictions on that).")
