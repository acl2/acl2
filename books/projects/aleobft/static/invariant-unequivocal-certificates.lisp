     In order for two different certificates with the same author and round

     a quorum @($n - F$) of validators must have signed both.

     the intersection of any two sets of @($n - F$) validators
     has at least @($F + 1$) validators,

     takes a bit of work, explained below as we develop the proof.
     New certificates are created only by @('create-certificate') events,

     must have different author or round from all the existing ones.
     This involves showing that,

  ;; This is the main (non-local) theorem,
  ;; which asserts the preservation of the invariant
  ;; by CREATE-CERTIFICATE events.
  ;; The hints are structural,
  ;; typical when there are universal quantifications in ACL2:
  ;; we expand the universal quantification in the conclusion,
  ;; which generates the arbitrary witnesses,
  ;; and we use the '-NECC' property
  ;; of the universal quantification in the hypothesis
  ;; (it does not just apply as a rewrite rule).
  ;; Behind the scenes, the rewrite rule
  ;; NOT-CREATE-CERTIFICATE-POSSIBLEP-WHEN-EXISTING-AUTHOR+ROUND
  ;; proved just above applies,
  ;; resolving the non-trivial case of the proof below.
