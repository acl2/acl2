    "The starting point is an anchor, @('current-anchor')
     and an even round, @('previous-round'), that precedes the anchor.
     The recursion terminates when @('previous-round')
     reaches the last committed round:
     we return a singleton list with the current anchor.
     The last committed round is passed as input @('last-committed-round').
     If @('previous-round') is larger than @('last-committed-round'),
     we find the leader at @('previous-round'),
     and we use @(tsee path-to-author+round) to find the anchor, if any,
     at @('previous-round') reachable from the current anchor.
     If there is no such reachable previous anchor,
     including the possibility that
     there is no leader because the committee is empty
     (although this never happens, due to invariants proved elsewhere),
     we recursively examine the even round
     just before @('previous-round'),
     with the same @('current-anchor');
     in the recursion, we will be looking for longer paths,
     from the same @('current-anchor') to a round further behind.
     If there is an anchor at @('previous-round'),
     it becomes the new @('current-anchor'),
     and we recursively examine its previous even round,
     but since we changed @('current-anchor'),
     in the recursion DAG paths will be from the new @('current-anchor').
     The recursive call will return a list of anchors
     that includes the anchor passed as first argument.
     thus, when that anchor changes (i.e. when the previous anchor is found),
     we add the old @('current-anchor') to the list.
     The resulting list of anchors is in inverse chronological order:
     the leftmost anchor is the newest one (i.e. greatest round number);
     the rightmost anchor is the oldest one (i.e. smallest round number).")

    "Since @('previous-round') eventually reaches @('last-committed-round')
     (at the end of the recursion),
     which is a natural number (i.e. a round number or 0),
     the @('previous-round') input of this ACL2 function
     is also a natural number (i.e. a round number or 0).")
   (xdoc::p
    "In order to calculate the leader at @('previous-round'),
     as it may also change during the recursion,
     we need to know the active committee at that round.
     So we pass the blockchain so far as an input to this function,
     and we require in the guard that the active committee
     is known at @('previous-round'),
     which implies that it is also known at smaller rounds.
     Note that the @('blockchain') input does not change in the recursion:
     it is simply the current blockchain,
     which this operation is not extending;
     this operation is just collecting the anchors
     with which the blockchain is (elsewhere) extended.
     It is an invariant, proved elsewhere,
     that @('last-committed-round') is in fact the round of the latest block
     (or 0 if the blockchain is empty)."))
