This directory contains ACL2 proof scripts for some results of elementary
number theory.  It includes the following ACL2 books:

  euclid
     Divisibility, primes, and two theorems of Euclid:
     (1) The infinitude of the set of primes
     (2) if p is a prime and p divides a * b, then p divides either a or b.

  fermat
     Fermat's Theorem: if p is a prime and p does not divide m, then
     mod(m^(p-1),p) = 1.

  euler
     Quadratic residues and Euler's Criterion: if p is an odd prime and p does
     not divide m, then

          mod(m^((p-1)/2),p) = 1 if m is a quadratic residue mod p
                               p-1 if not.

     A by-product of the proof is Wilson's Theorem: mod((p-1)!,p) = p-1.
     As a consequence, we also prove the First Supplement to the Law of Quadratic
     Reciprocity: -1 is a quadratic residue mod p iff mod(p,4) = 1.

  gauss
      Gauss's Lemma:  Let p be an odd prime and let m be relatively prime to p.
      Let mu be the number of elements of the sequence

        (mod(m,p), mod(2*m,p), ..., mod(((p-1)/2)*m,p))

      that exceed (p-1)/2.  Then m is a quadratic residue mod p iff mu is even.
      As a corollary, we also prove the Second Supplement to the Law of Quadratic
      Reciprocity: 2 is a quadratic residue mod p iff mod(p,8) is either 1 or -1.

  eisenstein
      A formalization of Eisenstein's proof of the law of quadratic reciprocity:
        If p and q are distinct odd primes, then 
          (p is a quadratic residue mod q <=> q is a quadratic residue mod p)
            <=>
          ((p-1)/2) * ((q-1)/2) is even.


  mersenne
      An application to the Mersenne prime problem by way of a theorem of Euler:
      if p and 2*p+1 are both prime and mod(p,4) = 3, then 2^p-1 is divisible by
      2*p+1")

  pratt
      Vaughn Pratt's method of prime certification applied to the prime 2^255 - 19.
