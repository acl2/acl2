# This script scans for dependencies of some ACL2 .cert files.
# Run "perl cert.pl -h" for usage.

# This script scans for include-book forms in the .lisp file
# corresponding to each .cert target and recursively maps out the
# dependencies of all files needed.  When it is finished, it writes
# out a file Makefile-tmp which can be used to make all the targets.

# This script chooses which ACL2 to use by the following methods, in
# decreasing order of priority:
#   - use the ACL2 specified by the -a or --acl2 command line argument
#   - use the ACL2 specified by the environment variable $ACL2
#   - use whatever "acl2" exists in the $PATH

# This script chooses which community books directory to use by the
# following methods, in decreasing order of priority:
#   - use the directory specified by the -b or --acl2-books command line argument
#   - use the directory specified by the environment variable $ACL2_SYSTEM_BOOKS
#   - look for a "books" directory where the ACL2 we're using is located
#   - run ACL2 and check if (@ system-books-dir) evaluates to a directory that exists
#   - use the parent of the directory containing this script

# This script also scans the relevant .acl2 files for each book, looking for
# (add-include-book-dir ...) commands, and scans the relevant .image files to
# determine alternative ACL2 executables to use for certain books.  These
# alternative ACL2 executables will be searched for in the directory specified
# by the --bin command line argument, if any, or in the $PATH if --bin is not
# provided.

Usage:
perl cert.pl <options, targets>

where targets are filenames of ACL2 files or certificates to be built
and options are as listed below.  Cert.pl scans the filenames for
dependencies and recursively scans their dependencies as well.
It then (optionally) builds a makefile and (optionally) runs it so as
to certify the named targets.

Cert.pl begins computing the dependencies for a book by ensuring that
its .lisp file exists.  It then looks for either a corresponding .acl2
file or a cert.acl2 file in its directory and scans that if it finds
one, treating dependencies found in that scan as dependencies of the
book.  It recognizes LD forms in these .acl2 files and scans the
loaded files as well.  When that is finished, it scans the book
itself.

DEPENDENCY SCAN

Cert.pl recognize several kinds of forms as producing or affecting
dependencies.  All such forms must be contained on a single line or
cert.pl will not recognize them.  As such, if you want to hide, say,
an include-book from cert.pl, you may insert a line break somewhere
inside it.  Certain forms will also be ignored if they occur after a
semicolon on the same line (a Lisp comment); the exceptions are noted.
The following forms are recognized:

 - (include-book "<bookname>" [:dir :<dirname>])
     Adds the included book\'s :cert file as a dependency of the
current book.  Note: Adding a comment \";; no_port\" on the same line
after the closing parenthesis will override the build system\'s default
behavior of loading the .port file for the included book before certifying
the containing book; see the xdoc topic pre-certify-book-commands.

 - (add-include-book-dir :<dirname> "<dirpath>")
     Registers an association between the given dirname and dirpath so
that we may correctly decode include-book and other forms with :dir
:<dirname>.

 - (depends-on "<filename>" [:dir :<dirname>])
     Adds the named file as a dependency of the current book.  May
occur in a comment, since depends-on is not defined in ACL2.  Note: If
you want to add a dependency on a book, just use include-book (inside
a multiline comment, if you don\'t want it actually included.
Depends-on is intended for non-book dependencies, so cert.pl won\'t
scan the target for its dependencies.

 - (loads "<filename>" [:dir :<dirname>])
     Adds the named file as a dependency of the current book, and also
recursively scans that file for dependencies as if it were part of the
current file.  May occur in a comment, since it is not defined in
ACL2.

 - (ld "<filename>" [:dir :<dirname>])
     Ignored when it occurs while scanning the main book, as opposed
to an .acl2 file or a file recursively LD\'d by an .acl2 file, this
causes cert.pl to recursively scan the LD\'d file for dependencies as
if it were part of the current file.

 - ;; cert_param: (<paramname>[=<paramval>])
     Cert_param directives control various things about how the file
gets certified, such as whether it uses provisional certification
(pcert), acl2x expansion (acl2x), and skip-proofs during acl2x
expansion (acl2xskip).  See the \"cert_param\" xdoc topic for various
other variables that can be set.

See the documentation topic BOOKS-CERTIFICATION for supported uses of
cert.pl.

SPECIAL MAKEFILE VARIABLES

An advanced feature of cert.pl is the ability to set up Make variables
that contain the recursive dependencies of certain sources.  For example,

 cert.pl -s my_mkfile  AB: a.cert b.cert CDE: c.cert e.cert d.cert

creates a makefile, my_mkfile, that (in addition to containing the
usual dependency graph, defines variables AB_SOURCES, AB_CERTS,
CDE_SOURCES, and CDE_CERTS.  AB_SOURCES contains all non-cert files
that a.cert and b.cert recursively depend on, AB_CERTS contains all
cert files they depend on, and similarly for CDE_SOURCES and
CDE_CERTS.  This is sometimes useful in case you wish to set up a
makefile with several distinct targets that depend on overlapping sets
of books.

CERT_PL_EXCLUDE FILES

Note: The following behavior is nullified if the --include-excludes
command line option is given; that is, the existence of cert_pl_exclude
files will just be ignored.

Cert.pl can be prevented from exploring a directory (recursively) by
creating a file called "cert_pl_exclude".  Any book found to be
under a directory containing that file will not be scanned for
dependencies and won\'t have any dependencies added for it.  However,
only certain directories are searched, depending on where the book is
relative to where cert.pl is invoked.  To illustrate:

(1) If cert.pl reaches a book whose relative path is foo/bar/baz.lisp,
then it will skip the dependency scan if any of the following exist:
  ./cert_pl_exclude
  foo/cert_pl_exclude
  foo/bar/cert_pl_exclude
but not:
  ../cert_pl_exclude.

(2) If cert.pl reaches a book whose relative path is
../../foo/bar/baz.lisp, then it will skip the dependency scan if any
of the following exist:
  ../../cert_pl_exclude
  ../../foo/cert_pl_exclude
  ../../foo/bar/cert_pl_exclude
but not:
  ./cert_pl_exclude
  ../cert_pl_exclude
  ../../../cert_pl_exclude.


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

   --help
   -h
           Display this help and exit.

   --jobs <n>
   -j <n>
           Use n processes to build certificates in parallel.

   --acl2 <cmd>
   -a <cmd>
           Use <cmd> as the ACL2 executable.  This overrides the ACL2
           environment variable, if that variable is set.  If neither
           is set, the location of the ACL2 executable is guessed by
           searching the PATH for an executable named "acl2".

   --acl2-books <dir>
   -b <dir>
           Use <dir> as the ACL2 system books directory.  This
           overrides the ACL2_SYSTEM_BOOKS environment variable, if
           that variable is set.  If neither is set, a directory is
           guessed based on the location of the ACL2 executable, or
           the value of (@ system-books-dir) as reported by the ACL2
           executable, or the location of this script, in that order.

   --clean-certs
   --cc
           Delete each certificate file and corresponding .out and
           .time file encountered in the dependency search.  Warning:
           Unless the "-n"/"--no-build" flag is given, the script will
           then subsequently rebuild these files.

   --no-build
   -n
           Don\'t create a makefile or call make; just run this script
           for "side effects" such as cleaning or generating
           dependency cache files.

   --clean-all
   -c
           Just clean up certificates and dependency cache files,
           don\'t generate new cache files or build certificates.
           Equivalent to "-n -cc".

   -o <makefile-name>
           Determines where to write the dependency information;
           default is Makefile-tmp.

   --smakefile
           Also write out S-expression version of the dependency information.
           Appends ".lsp" to the <makefile-name> provided by "-o",
           or Makefile-tmp.lsp by default.

   --verbose-deps
   -v
           Print out dependency information as it\'s discovered.

   --makefile-only
   -m
           Don\'t run make after running the dependency analysis.

   --static-makefile <makefile-name>
   -s <makefile-name>
           Equivalent to -m -o <makefile-name>.  Useful for
           building a static makefile for your targets, which will
           suffice for certifying them as long as the dependencies
           between source files don\'t change.

   --no-boilerplate
           Omit from the makefile the inclusion of make_cert, which
           provides the rule for building a certificate, and the
           settings of the ACL2 and ACL2_SYSTEM_BOOKS variables.  This
           will create a makefile containing the list of certificates
           and dependencies between them and the sources, suitable for
           including in another makefile.

   --var-prefix <name>
           By default, cert.pl will write a makefile containing
           settings of the variables CERT_PL_SOURCES and
           CERT_PL_CERTS.  If this flag is provided, then the
           variables are named <name>_SOURCES and <name>_CERTS
           instead.  This is useful for situations in which an outer
           makefile includes more than one makefile generated by
           cert.pl.

   --include <makefile-name>
   -i <makefile-name>
           Include the specified makefile via an include command in
           the makefile produced.  Multiple -i arguments may be given
           to include multiple makefiles.  The include commands occur
           before the dependencies in the makefile.

   --include-after <makefile-name>
   -ia <makefile-name>
           Include the specified makefile via an include command in
           the makefile produced.  Multiple -ia arguments may be given
           to include multiple makefiles.  The include commands occur
           after the dependencies in the makefile.

   --relative-paths <dir>
   -r <dir>
           Use paths relative to the given directory rather than
           the current directory.

   --targets <file>
   -t <file>
           Add as targets the files listed in <file>.  Whitespace is
           ignored, # comments out the rest of a line, and filenames
           are listed one per line.

   --deps-of <file>
   -p <file>
           Add as targets the dependencies of file.  That is, file is
           not itself added as a target, but anything necessary for
           its certification will be.

   --quiet
   -q
           Don\'t print any asides except for errors and output from
           --source-cmd commands.

   --debug
           Print some debugging info as the program runs.

   --source-cmd <command-str>
           Run the following command on each source file.  The actual
           command line is created by replacing the string {} with the
           target file in the command string.  For example:
               cert.pl top.lisp -n --source-cmd "echo {}; wc {}"
           Any number of --source-cmd directives may be given; the
           commands will then be run in the order in which they are given.

   --otherdep-cmd <command-str>
           Run the command on each non-source dependency file, in the same
           manner as --source-cmd.  Non-source dependencies include files
           referenced by depends-on comments as well as .image files.

   --out-of-date-cmd <command-str>
           Like --source-cmd, but runs the command on all of the bottommost
           out of date certificates in the dependency tree.  {} is replaced
           by the base name of the book, that is, without the ".cert".

   --up-to-date-cmd <command-str>
           Like --source-cmd, but runs the command on all of the top-most
           up to date certificates in the dependency tree.  {} is replaced
           by the base name of the book, that is, without the ".cert".

   --all-out-of-date-cmd <command-str>
           Like --source-cmd, but runs the command on all of the
           out of date certificates in the dependency tree.  {} is replaced
           by the base name of the book, that is, without the ".cert".

   --all-up-to-date-cmd <command-str>
           Like --source-cmd, but runs the command on all of the
           up to date certificates in the dependency tree.  {} is replaced
           by the base name of the book, that is, without the ".cert".

   --force-up-to-date <fname>
   --force-out-of-date <fname>
           Consider the given file(s) up to date or out of date regardless
           of the actual facts, for purposes of the above command forms,
           --out-of-date-cmd and the rest. Note these do not affect the set
           of files to be built by make.

   --tags-file <tagfile>
           Create an Emacs tags file containing the tags for all
           source files.  Equivalent to
           --source-cmd "etags -a -o tagfile {}".

   --svn-status
           Traverse the dependency tree and run "svn status" on each
           source file in the tree.  Equivalent to
           --source-cmd "svn status --no-ignore {}".

   --make-args <arg>
           Add command line arguments to make.  Multiple such
           directives may be given.

   --keep-going
   -k
           Passes the -k/--keep-going flag to make, which causes it to
           build as many targets as possible even after an error. Same
           as "--make-args -k".

   --bin <directory>

          Sets the location for ACL2 image files.  Cert.pl supports
          the use of different ACL2 images to certify different books.
          If for a book named foo.lisp either a file foo.image or
          cert.image exists in the same directory, then cert.pl reads
          a line from that file and takes that line to be the name of
          the image to use.  The default is "acl2".  If the image
          name is not "acl2" and a --bin directory is set, then
          cert.pl adds a foo.cert dependency on
          <bin_dir>/<image_name>, and uses <bin_dir>/<image_name> to
          certify the book.  Otherwise, no additional dependency is
          set, and at certification time we look for the image in the
          user\'s PATH.

   --params <filename>
          Specifies a file that contains lines like:
             mybook.cert:  pcert = 1, acl2x = 0
          with the grammar:
             <bookname>.cert: <param> = <val> [ , <param> = <val> ]*
          The parameters specified have the same meaning as cert_param
          directives in the books themselves, and if the same parameter
          is assigned in the book and in the params file, the params
          file takes precedence.

   --cache <filename>
          Specifies a file to use as a sourcefile events cache.  Such
          a file records events such as include-book, cert-param,
          etc., that are present in each source file.  When this
          option is given, cached information is read from that file
          if it is present, and updated information is written to it
          when we are done.  Using a cache may improve performance by
          reducing the number of source files that must be scanned for
          events.  File modification times are used to determine when
          the cached information about a file must be updated.

   --cache-read-only
          Only read from the cache file, don\'t update it.

   --cache-write-only
          Only write out a cache file, don\'t read from it.

   --write-sources <filename>
          Dump the list of all source files, one per line, into filename.

   --write-certs <filename>
          Dump the list of all cert files, one per line, into filename.

   --write-otherdeps <filename>
          Dump the list of all non-source dependencies, one per line, into filename.

   --pcert-all
          Allow provisional certification for all books, not just the ones with
          the \'pcert\' cert_param.

   --target-ext <extension>
   -e <extension>
          Normally, when targets are specified by their source filename (.lisp)
          or without an extension, rather than by their target filename (.cert,
          .acl2x, .pcert0, .pcert1) or when targets are specified as dependencies
          of some book with \'-p\', the target extension used is \'cert\'.
          This option allows you to specify this default extension as (say)
          \'pcert0\' instead.

   --include-excludes
          If this option is set then cert_pl_exclude files are ignored; see the
          section CERT_PL_EXCLUDE FILES above.

   --print-relocs
          Causes relocation stub warnings to be printed even if --quiet.  By
          default cert.pl prints warnings about "relocation stubs", which are
          books containing the \'reloc_stub\' cert_param, signifying that they
          are placeholders for books that have been refactored away or moved to
          new locations.  Normally --quiet suppresses these warnings, but this
          option causes them to print anyway.

USEFUL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

    TIME_CERT (default: "")
         Can be set to 1 to enable .cert.time files, which can be used by tools
         such as critpath.pl for build profiling.

    CERT_PL_NO_COLOR (default: "")
         Can be set to disable ANSI color coded output.

    CERT_PL_SHOW_HOSTNAME (default: "")
         Off by default.  Set to 1 to instruct cert.pl to include hostname
         information in its output.  Potentially useful if you are using a
         cluster of machines to certify books, but adds some file IO because
         hostnames are read out of the .cert.out files.

    ACL2_BOOKS_DEBUG (default: "")
         Can be set to 1 to enable extra debugging information and to preserve
         temporary files.

    CERT_PL_RM_OUTFILES (default: "")
         Can be set to 1 to instruct cert.pl to delete .cert.out files after
         successful book certification.  (The output will be kept for failed
         certification attempts, since in that case you may want to inspect
         it.)

    CERT_PL_TEMP_DIR (default: "")
         Can be set to a directory to instruct cert.pl to use this other
         directory for temporary files such as workxxx files (which contain
         certification instructions) and .cert.out files.  Note that this
         does not affect .cert.time files.

    STARTJOB (default: "bash")
         Can be set to the name of a command to use instead of bash
         when launching a subprocess that will run ACL2.  The command
         will be called as `$STARTJOB -c "bash code"`.  This is mainly
         useful if you wish ACL2 to always be run in some environment
         other than the current shell -- for example, if you want to
         run ACL2 on a managed compute cluster, you might set
         $STARTJOB to the name of a script that queues a job on the cluster.
