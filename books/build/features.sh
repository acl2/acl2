# This script is based on an equivalent series of commands in
# GNUMakefile, adapted into a shell script by Sol Swords.

# ========================================================================

# This script checks for various features that some books require.
# This used to all be done in GNUMakefile itself, but we separated it
# in case other Makefiles want to use it as well.  To use it in a
# Makefile, first run it and then include the resulting
# Makefile-features, making sure that ACL2 and STARTJOB are in the
# environment -- e.g.:
# RUN_ACL2_FEATURES := $(shell cd $(BUILD_DIR); ACL2=$(ACL2) STARTJOB=$(STARTJOB) ./features.sh)
# -include $(BUILD_DIR)/Makefile-features

# We first run ACL2 on the cert_features.lsp script, which begins by
# setting up several variables (in Makefile syntax) in
# Makefile-features.  These primarily are features of ACL2 itself --
# ACL2_HAS_PARALLEL etc.  But we also set USE_QUICKLISP if it is not
# already set, because by default we set it to 1 except if the host
# Lisp is GCL.

# cert_features.lsp also sets up a few .certdep files that determine
# whether certain books need to be updated due to a change in
# e.g. acl2-exports.

# After that we look for several executables and features of the
# environment to determine whether we have the Glucose SAT solver, an
# IPASIR shared library, the z3 SMT solver, etc.  For each of these,
# we append more settings to the end of Makefile-features.

# For each variable that Makefile-features sets, it also adds that
# variable name to the EXPORTED_VARS list.  It then finally creates a
# variable called EXPORT_SHELL_ENV which is a series of
# space-delimited NAME=val pairs that can be used to work around the
# fact that while Gnu Make's "export" command affects the environment
# for shell commands within recipes, it doesn't affact the environment
# for $(shell ...) directives.
