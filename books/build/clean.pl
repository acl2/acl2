This script removes temporary files like foo.cert, foo.cert.out, foo.time,
etc., which arise from certifying ACL2 books with cert.pl or similar.

The cleaning is done in:
  - your current directory, and
  - all subdirectories of the current directory, recursively.

Usage: clean.pl [OPTIONS]

Options:

    -h          Show this help message and exit immediately
    --help

    --dryrun    Print what will be deleted, but do NOT actually delete
                any files.
