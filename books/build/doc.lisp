  :short "@('cert.pl') is a mature, user-friendly, industrial-strength tool for
certifying ACL2 @(see acl2::books)."

  :long "<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>For \"pure\" ACL2 projects&mdash;even large ones&mdash;@('cert.pl') will let
you to certify any book, whenever you like, without writing any Makefiles.  If
your book includes supporting books that aren't certified, @('cert.pl') will
rebuild exactly the necessary books, in parallel, even if they're in other
directories.</p>

<p>For more complex projects, where (say) besides just certifying ACL2 books
you also need to build large C libraries and certify ACL2 books that you're
generating on the fly, @('cert.pl') can automate the dependency tracking for
your regular ACL2 books, and you can easily integrate this information into
your project's @('Makefile').</p>

<p>For industrial-scale projects, @('cert.pl') has many features that you may
find valuable.  For instance:</p>

<ul>

<li>ACL2 features like packages, ttags, @(see add-include-book-dir), and @(see
save-exec) images are properly supported.  In particular,
(@('.port')) files (see @(see acl2::portcullis)) of included books are loaded
automatically before certification; see @(see pre-certify-book-commands).</li>

<li>Parallel builds (as in @('make -j')) are well-supported.  For the truly
adventurous, you may even be able to distribute your build over a cluster.</li>

<li>Tools like @('critpath.pl') can help you to more effectively optimize your
build time for multi-core environments.</li>

<li>Dependency scanning is cached for better performance on NFS file
systems.</li>

<li>Ifdef/ifndef constructs are supported for conditional build features -- see
@(see acl2::ifdef), @(see acl2::ifndef), @(see acl2::ifdef-define), and @(see
acl2::ifdef-undefine).</li>

</ul>

<p>@('cert.pl') was originally developed in 2008 by Sol Swords at <a
href='http://www.centtech.com/'>Centaur Technology</a>, and has been actively
used and improved since then.  It is now distributed in the @('build')
directory of the Community Books, and is today the main tool behind
@('books/GNUmakefile').</p>


<h3>Using @('cert.pl')</h3>

<p>This documentation is really a <b>tutorial</b>, not a reference.  We
recommend that you read the topics in order.  Also see @(see
acl2::books-certification) for additional information on how to automate the
certification of the @(see community-books), and for more details, execute the
following command in the shell.</p>

@({
     <path_to_acl2>/books/build/cert.pl --help
})

<p>We assume basic familiarity with a Unix environment, e.g., we expect that
you know how to edit your startup scripts to set up a @('PATH'), create
symbolic links, etc.</p>")

  :short "Special notes about using @('cert.pl') on Windows."

  :long "<p>There are two main ways you can run @('cert.pl') (and for that
matter ACL2) on Windows.</p>

<h3>Option 1: Virtual Machine</h3>

<p>A good way to run ACL2 on Windows may be to install an operating system like
Linux inside of virtual machine.  Some options are:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href='https://www.virtualbox.org/'>VirtualBox</a> (free)</li>

<li><a href='https://www.vmware.com/products/player/'>VMWare Player</a> (free
for personal use)</li>

<li><a href='https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation/'>VMWare
Workstation</a> (commercial)</li>

</ul>

<p>Using a virtual machine certainly has its downsides.  You're committing to a
certain amount of configuration, sacrificing some disk space and memory, and
probably losing some performance.  Even so, you may find this option to be
generally more reliable than using Unix tools like @('make') and Lisp runtimes
on a Windows system.</p>


<h3>Option 2: Native Windows</h3>

<p>If you prefer to avoid using a virtual machine, you may still be able to use
@('cert.pl') on Windows.  Unlike other operating systems, Windows does not
include a typical Unix environment with commands like @('ls'), @('rm'),
@('grep'), etc, so using ACL2 on Windows typically means installing a Unix
emulation layer such as <a href='http://www.cygwin.com/'>cygwin</a> or <a
href='http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS'>msys</a>.</p>

<p>We do not know which to recommend because we have experienced problems on
both!  With msys, we have seen @('make') hang when we try parallel builds.
With cygwin, we have sometimes seen \"random\" CCL crashes.  From time to time,
we have successfully used @('cert.pl') on msys with a single-threaded
build.</p>

<p>Both cygwin and msys have their own Perl packages available.  For
@('cert.pl') to work, please make sure you are using the Cygwin or Msys version
of Perl.  Native Windows versions of Perl, such as Strawberry Perl, are <b>not
known to work</b>.</p>

<p>We intend for @('cert.pl') to work on Windows.  If you experience any
problems that you believe are due to @('cert.pl') itself, rather than with
@('make') or with your Lisp, then we would appreciate your help with
beta-testing and with making it more robust.</p>")



(defxdoc preliminaries
  :parents (cert.pl)
  :short "Where to find @('cert.pl'), how to set up your environment before
using it, and the supporting software you'll need."

  :long "<h3>Prerequisite Software</h3>

<p>We assume that you have a basic, sensible Unix environment; Windows users
should see @(see cert-pl-on-windows).</p>

<p>We assume that you have <a href='http://www.gnu.org/software/make/'>GNU
Make</a> installed and available as @('make') in your @('$PATH').  Some
operating systems (e.g., FreeBSD) use a non-GNU make by default.  You can check
your copy by running @('make --version'); it should say something like \"GNU
Make 3.81.\"</p>

<p>We assume you have <a href='http://www.perl.org/'>Perl</a> installed, and
that your @('perl') executable is in your @('$PATH').</p>

<p>We assume you have <a href='http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~moore/acl2/'>ACL2</a>
or one of its variants like ACL2(p) or ACL2(r) installed, and that
you know how to launch ACL2&mdash;usually with a script named @('saved_acl2')
or similar.</p>

<p>We assume you have a copy of the ACL2 <a
href='https://code.google.com/p/acl2-books/'>Community Books</a> for your
version of ACL2; they are usually put in @('acl2/books').</p>


<h3>Adding @('cert.pl') to your @('$PATH')</h3>

<p>To make running @('cert.pl') more convenient, it's a good idea to have it
accessible in your @('$PATH').  The @('cert.pl') script and related tools like
@('critpath.pl') and @('clean.pl') are found in the @('build') directory of the
Community Books.</p>

<ul>

<li>We recommend that you edit your startup scripts (e.g., @('.bashrc') or
similar) to add @('acl2/books/build') to your @('$PATH').</li>

<li>You could alternately set up symlinks to @('acl2/books/build/cert.pl') and
the other scripts from a directory that is already in your path, for instance,
@('~/bin') is commonly used for this.</li>

</ul>

<p>To test that this is working, you can run @('cert.pl --help').  It should
print a usage message, e.g.,:</p>

@({
     $ cert.pl --help

     cert.pl: Automatic dependency analysis for certifying ACL2 books.

     Usage:
     perl cert.pl <options, targets>
     ...
})


<h3>Helping @('cert.pl') find ACL2 and the community books</h3>

<p>It is convenient for @('cert.pl') to \"just know\" where your copy of ACL2
is located.</p>

<ul>

<li>We recommend that you configure your @('$PATH') so that running @('acl2')
will invoke ACL2.  You could do this by adding a symlink to your
@('saved_acl2') script, named @('acl2'), to a directory like @('~/bin').</li>

<li>Alternately, you may set the environment variable @('$ACL2') to point to
your ACL2 executable.  For instance, you might add something like the following
to your @('.bashrc') or similar:

@({
      export ACL2=/path/to/acl2/saved_acl2
})

This takes precedence over an executable named @('acl2') in your @('$PATH'), if
one exists.</li>

</ul>

<p>A third option is to tell @('cert.pl') explicitly which ACL2 you would like
it to use, by using the @('--acl2') or @('-a') flag:</p>

@({
      $ cert.pl -a /path/to/acl2/saved_acl2 [...]
})

<p>This takes precedence over both the environment variable and any @('acl2')
in your @('$PATH').</p>

<p>To ensure that @('cert.pl') is properly detecting your copy of ACL2, you can
run @('cert.pl') with no arguments.  The output should look something like
this:</p>

@({
     $ cert.pl
     ACL2 executable is /home/jared/acl2/saved_acl2
     System books directory is /home/jared/acl2/books
     ...
})

<p>Please check that <b>both</b> the ACL2 executable and your @('books')
directory are correctly detected.  If the books directory is not correct, you
may need to help @('cert.pl') find it by setting another environment variable,
e.g.,</p>

@({
    export ACL2_SYSTEM_BOOKS=/home/jared/acl2/books
})

<p>Alternatively, you can tell @('cert.pl') explicitly which books directory
you would like it to use, by using the @('--acl2-books') or @('-b') flag:</p>

@({
      $ cert.pl -b /home/jared/acl2/books [...]
})

<p>This takes precedence over the environment variable.</p>

<p>At this point, @('cert.pl') should be configured properly and ready to
use.</p>

<p>Incidentally, if @('cert.pl') cannot determine the location of the books
directory from one of the above two directives, it will first try to find a
@('books') directory alongside the ACL2 executable.  If this fails, it will run
the ACL2 executable and ask it for the value of the global variable
@('system-books-dir').  If the response it receives does not point to a
directory that exists on the filesystem, @('cert.pl') finally chooses the
parent directory of its own location.</p>")



(defxdoc certifying-simple-books ; Step 1
  :parents (cert.pl)
  :short "How to use certify simple ACL2 books, take advantage of parallel
builds, and manage the dependency scanner."

  :long "<h3>Basic Example</h3>

<p>Let's use @('cert.pl') to build a simple ACL2 project.  Say we have two ACL2
books:</p>

@({
    ;; inc.lisp            |  ;; prop.lisp
    (in-package \"ACL2\")    |  (in-package \"ACL2\")
    (defun inc (x)         |  (include-book \"inc\")
      (+ 1 x))             |
                           |  (defthm natp-of-inc
                           |    (implies (natp x)
                           |             (natp (inc x)))
})

<p>We can now certify either book by just running @('cert.pl') on it.  Let's
first just build the @('inc') book:</p>

@({
$ cert.pl inc
ACL2 executable is /home/jared/bin/acl2
System books directory is /home/jared/acl2/books/
Making /home/jared/acl2/books/tmp/inc.cert on 25-Oct-2013 21:49:11
Successfully built /home/jared/acl2/books/tmp/inc.cert
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jared logic 378 Oct 25 21:49 inc.cert
})

<p>If we run @('ls'), we'll now see some new files:</p>

<ul>

<li>@('inc.cert'), the ACL2 @(see acl2::certificate) for @('inc.lisp')</li>

<li>@('inc.cert.out'), the log for certifying @('inc'); this shows the
instructions that were submitted to ACL2, and the output from the @(see
certify-book) command.</li>

<li>@('inc.lx64fsl') or @('.fasl') or perhaps some other extension, depending
on the underlying host Lisp.</li>

<li>@('Makefile-tmp'), a Makefile that @('cert.pl') generated.</li>
</ul>

<p>We might now run @('cert.pl') to certify the @('prop') book.  Since @('inc')
is already certified, it only needs to build @('prop'):</p>

@({
$ cert.pl prop
ACL2 executable is /home/jared/bin/acl2
System books directory is /home/jared/acl2/books/
Making /home/jared/acl2/books/tmp/prop.cert on 26-Oct-2013 07:55:16
Successfully built /home/jared/acl2/books/tmp/prop.cert
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jared logic 465 Oct 26 07:55 prop.cert
})

<p>An @('ls') will now show us many files:</p>

@({
$ ls
inc.cert      inc.lisp     Makefile-tmp  prop.cert.out  prop.lx64fsl
inc.cert.out  inc.lx64fsl  prop.cert     prop.lisp
})

<p>We can delete the generated files with <b>clean.pl</b>, a companion script
of @('cert.pl'):</p>

@({
    $ clean.pl
    clean.pl: scanning for generated files
    clean.pl: found 7 targets (0 seconds)
    clean.pl: deleted 7 files (0 seconds)
    $ ls
    inc.lisp  prop.lisp
})

<p>If we now tell @('cert.pl') to certify the @('prop') book directly, it will
notice that the @('inc') book needs to be certified, and do the right thing:</p>

@({
$ cert.pl prop
ACL2 executable is /home/jared/bin/acl2
System books directory is /home/jared/acl2/books/
Making /home/jared/acl2/books/tmp/inc.cert on 26-Oct-2013 07:59:41
Successfully built /home/jared/acl2/books/tmp/inc.cert
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jared logic 378 Oct 26 07:59 inc.cert
Making /home/jared/acl2/books/tmp/prop.cert on 26-Oct-2013 07:59:42
Successfully built /home/jared/acl2/books/tmp/prop.cert
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jared logic 465 Oct 26 07:59 prop.cert
})


<h3>Useful Features</h3>


<h5>Multiple Targets</h5>

<p>You can tell @('cert.pl') to build multiple top-level books at once, for
instance:</p>

@({
    $ cert.pl foo bar baz
})

<p>will try to certify @('foo.lisp'), @('bar.lisp'), and @('baz.lisp').</p>


<h5>File Name Extensions</h5>

<p>You don't have to include a @('.lisp') or @('.cert') extension, but if you
do, @('cert.pl') will do what you mean.  For instance, the following commands
are all equivalent:</p>

@({
     $ cert.pl foo
     $ cert.pl foo.lisp
     $ cert.pl foo.cert
})

<p>The @('.lisp') form can be handy, e.g., you can do:</p>

@({
     $ cert.pl *.lisp
})


<h5>Parallel Builds (-j)</h5>

<p>You can tell @('cert.pl') to build books in parallel, to take advantage of
multi-core processors.  The @('-j') switch tells it how many processors you
want to use, just like with @('make').  Typically you would want to set @('-j')
no higher than the number of cores your machine has available.  For
instance:</p>

@({
    $ cert.pl -j 2 foo    # for a dual-core system
    $ cert.pl -j 4 foo    # for a 4-core system
    $ cert.pl -j 8 foo    # for an 8-core system
})

<p><b>Warning</b>: setting @('-j') too high can cause serious performance
problems.  If you often use ACL2 on both, say, a 16-core server and a 2-core
laptop, then you may sometimes find yourself accidentally telling the laptop to
run 16 jobs at once!  To avoid this kind of trouble, Jared sets up an
@('alias') like this in his @('.bashrc'):</p>

@({
   # in the laptop's .bashrc:
   alias cj=\"cert.pl -j 2\"

   # in the server's .bashrc:
   alias cj=\"cert.pl -j 16\"
})

<p>This way, just running @('cj') will use an appropriate number of cores no
matter which system is being used.</p>

<p><b>Warning</b>: the CPU count is not the only factor to consider when
choosing a @('-j') to use.  You may also need to consider how much memory your
machine has.  For instance, on a quad-core laptop you'd like to run 4 jobs at
once, but if you only have 8 GB of memory and each job takes 4 GB, then using
@('-j 4') may get you into swapping trouble.</p>


<h5>Keep Going (-k)</h5>

<p>Like @('make'), @('cert.pl') will ordinarily stop as soon as it fails to
build any book.</p>

<p>Occasionally this may not be what you want.  You might have made a change
that you know will break several books.  One way to find out what's broken is
to just try to build everything.  The default behavior&mdash;stopping as soon
as anything is broken&mdash;will only let you find one broken book at a
time.</p>

<p>In this situation, you may want to instead do, e.g.,</p>

@({
    $ cert.pl -j 4 top.cert -k
})

<p>This is identical to @('make')'s \"keep going\" switch.</p>


<h5>Prepare (-p)</h5>

<p>Sometimes you want to work on a particular book, which you know won't
certify (e.g., because you're only part-way through a proof).  Before you begin
working on the book again, you may want to rebuild any supporting books it
depends on.  The @('-p') flag lets you do this, e.g.,</p>

@({
    $ cert.pl -p mybook
})

<p>won't try to certify @('mybook.lisp'), but it will try to certify any books
that @('mybook.lisp') includes.</p>


<h3>Dependency Scanning Limitations</h3>

<p>Keep in mind that @('cert.pl') is a dumb Perl script.  It's quite easy to
fool it using @(see acl2::macros) or other tricks.  But you don't even need to
get that fancy&mdash;a newline will do the trick.  For instance, if
@('foo.lisp') contains the following, then @('cert.pl') will not think it
depends on @('bar'):</p>

@({
   (include-book     ;; newline to fool dependency scanner
     \"bar\")
})

<p>This is documented behavior that you may rely on.</p>

<p>For instance, sometimes we put multi-line comments in books with performance
comparisons or other kinds of examples or testing code.  This code might need
additional include-books to work.  By putting in newlines, we can hide these
books from the dependency scanner, to avoid slowing down our build with
unnecessary dependencies.  For instance:</p>

@({
    (defun my-function ...)

    #|| ;; this benchmark says my-function is 3x faster than yours:

    (include-book           ;; fool dependency scanner
       \"your-function\")

    :q
    (time (loop for i fixnum from 1 to 100000 do (my-function ...)))
    (time (loop for i fixnum from 1 to 100000 do (your-function ...)))
    ||#

    (defthm my-lemma ...)
})

<p>You can also trick @('cert.pl') in the other direction, to add additional,
unnecessary dependencies.  For instance, a macro library might have some unit
testing books to try to ensure the macros are behaving correctly.  To ensure
these tests get run when the library is rebuilt, we might write a top book like
this:</p>

@({
    (in-package \"ACL2\")
    (include-book \"module1\")
    (include-book \"module2\")
    (include-book \"module3\")

    #|| ;; trick cert.pl into running the unit tests:
    (include-book \"module1-tests\")
    (include-book \"module2-tests\")
    (include-book \"module3-tests\")
    ||#
})")



(defxdoc pre-certify-book-commands ; Step 2
  :parents (cert.pl)
  :short "How to add commands to be executed before calling @(see
certify-book).  You'll need this to use ACL2 features like @(see defpkg) and
@(see add-include-book-dir)."

  :long "<h3>Background: Pre @(see certify-book) Commands</h3>

<p>ACL2 commands like @(see defpkg) can't be embedded within books.  Instead,
when using raw ACL2 to certify books, you typically define the package before
issuing the @(see certify-book) command.  The @(see defpkg) command then
becomes part of the book's @(see acl2::portcullis).</p>

<p>For example, here is how to successfully certify a book with its own
package, using raw ACL2:</p>

@({
   $ cat mybook.lisp
   (in-package \"MY-PACKAGE\")
   (defun f (x) (+ x 1))

   $ acl2
   ACL2 !> (defpkg \"MY-PACKAGE\"
             (union-eq *acl2-exports*
                       *common-lisp-symbols-from-main-lisp-package*))
   ACL2 !> (certify-book \"mybook\" ?)
})

<p>If this doesn't make sense, please see the documentation for @(see books),
especially see @(see acl2::book-example) which explains something like the
above in far greater detail.</p>


<h3>Individual @('.acl2') Files</h3>

<p>For @('cert.pl') to certify books with packages, it needs to be able to find
these extra @('defpkg') commands that can't go directly into the book.</p>

<p>If you are using only packages from existing libraries, these should be
dealt with automatically by the build system, which loads the portcullis
 (@('.port') file) of each included book before certifying a book.  (To defeat
this mechanism, add a comment containing \"no_port\" at the end of the line of
each include-book whose portculli you don't want.) However, if you are defining
a new package, you need to know how to put it in your book's portcullis.</p>

<p>The most basic way to tell @('cert.pl') how to certify a file like
@('mybook.lisp') is to put the @('defpkg') form into a corresponding file,
named @('mybook.acl2'):</p>

@({
    $ cat mybook.acl2
    (in-package \"ACL2\")
    (defpkg \"MY-PACKAGE\"
      (union-eq *acl2-exports*
                *common-lisp-symbols-from-main-lisp-package*))
    ;; no certify-book command, unlike in legacy files for Makefile-generic
})

<p>At this point, we can simply run:</p>

@({
    $ cert.pl mybook
    ACL2 executable is ...
    System books directory is ...
    Making .../mybook.cert on 24-Oct-2013 09:25:03
    Successfully built .../my-book.cert
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 jared logic 513 Oct 24 09:25 mybook.cert
})

<p>If you inspect the resulting @('mybook.cert.out') output log, you'll see
that these instructions that were picked up from the @('.acl2') file:</p>

@({
    $ cat mybook.cert.out
    -*- Mode: auto-revert -*-
    ...
    ; instructions from .acl2 file mybook.acl2:
    (in-package \"ACL2\")
    (defpkg \"MY-PACKAGE\"
      (union-eq *acl2-exports*
                *common-lisp-symbols-from-main-lisp-package*))
    ...
})

<p>Furthermore, if you inspect @('mybook.cert'), you'll see that defpkg form
replicated in the portcullis section of the certificate.  In fact, all the
books that include your book (transitively) or that also load the same package
will also replicate this form in their portculli.  This can be a problem
because including multiple books depending on this package requires checking
many times that this defpkg form is redundant, which can actually add up to a
significant performance problem.  We suggest using the discipline described in
@(see acl2::working-with-packages) instead.</p>

<h3>Directory-Wide @('cert.acl2') Files</h3>

<p>It's very common for all of the books in a directory to want to use the same
packages.  Instead of setting up a corresponding @('.acl2') file for every
single book, it is often much more convenient to use a special, directory-wide
@('.acl2') file, called @('cert.acl2').</p>

<p>Here is how @('cert.pl') chooses the @('.acl2') file to use when you ask
it to certify @('foo.lisp'):</p>

<ol>
<li>First, if a file named @('foo.acl2') exists, then it will be used.</li>
<li>Else, if a file named @('cert.acl2') exists, then it will be used.</li>
<li>Otherwise, no @('.acl2') files will be used; no pre @(see certify-book)
    commands will be given.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the typical case, then, where you have a whole directory of books that
are all supposed to be in some package, you just need a single @('cert.acl2')
file that gets that @(see defpkg) form loaded.</p>")

books to use unsafe features that can easily lead to unsoundness.  For

<p>However, these restrictions can be lifted by giving @('certify-book')
options such as @(':skip-proofs-okp t') and @(':ttags :all').  In such cases
the resulting certificate is annotated to reflect that it is less trustworthy
and @(see include-book) may print warnings about the book or even reject it
when given suitable options.  See @(see certify-book) and @(see include-book)
for details.</p>

<p>By default @('cert.pl') will similarly disallow these unsafe features.  More
precisely, the default command it uses to certify books is looks like this:</p>

@({  (certify-book \"foo\" ? t)  })

<p>If you want to permit your book to use trust tags, skipped proofs, etc.,
you'll need to tell @('cert.pl') that you want to give different arguments to
@('certify-book').</p>

<p>You can do this on a per-book or per-directory basis by adding a special
comment into the corresponding @('.acl2') file.  If you don't know what an
@('.acl2') file is, see @(see pre-certify-book-commands).</p>

<p>Example: to allow all trust tags, you could use a comment like this:</p>

  :long "<p>Alongside @('cert.pl') is another script, @('critpath.pl'), that
can be used to analyze the certification times for your files.  When you are
dealing with a large collection of ACL2 books, this can be a useful tool for
seeing where to speed up your build.</p>

<p>Before using @('critpath.pl'), you must tell @('cert.pl') that you want it
to record certification times.  This is done by setting the @('$TIME_CERT')
environment variable.  For instance, you might add the following to your
@('.bashrc') or equivalent:</p>

@({
    export TIME_CERT=yes
})

<p>After setting this variable, you will need to recertify your books.</p>

<p>When @('cert.pl') sees that @('$TIME_CERT') is set, it writes out additional
@('.cert.time') files that record how long each book took to certify.  The
@('critpath.pl') script then correlates these files with the dependencies among
your books to give you a report.</p>

<p>For instance, here is a report for the @('arithmetic-5/top') book, circa
October 2013.</p>

@({
$ cd arithmetic-5
$ critpath.pl top.cert
Critical Path

File                            Cumulative       Time    Speedup     Remove

you:</p>

<li>The @('speedup') time for each book.  This measures how much the critical
path could be reduced by speeding up the book, without affecting its
dependencies.  A book with a large @('speedup') time may be good candidate for
new hints to make proofs faster.</li>

<li>The @('remove') time for each book.  This measures how much your build
would speed up if you didn't need to build this book at all.  The @('remove')
time should always exceed the @('speedup') time.  In some cases, it may be much
larger, since by removing a book we may also avoid needing to build some of the

<ul>

<li>An ACL2 book for verifying a Java program might use @(see acl2::io)
routines to load @('encrypt.java'), or</li>

<li>An ACL2 book with trust tags might use @(see acl2::include-raw) to load in
some extra raw Lisp file named @('server-raw.lsp').</li>

</ul>

<p>In either case, since these extra files are not being loaded using @(see
include-book), @('cert.pl') will not automatically know that these book depend
on @('encrypt.java') and @('server-raw.lsp').</p>

<p>To tell @('cert.pl') about additional dependencies, you may put a special
@('depends-on') comment in your book.  For the Java program we might write
something like this:</p>

@({
    ; (depends-on \"encrypt.java\")
    (defconsts (*java-file* state)
      (read-java-program \"encrypt.java\"))

<p>Whereas for the server, you could write, e.g.,</p>

@({
    ; (depends-on \"server-raw.lsp\")
    (include-raw \"server-raw.lsp\")
})

<p>This dependency mechanism is good enough to handle situations where you are
directly reading in these source or data files.  However, it is <b>not</b>
general enough to handle the situations where the file you are reading needs to
be rebuilt.</p>

<p>For instance, suppose that our Java book doesn't verify a source code file
like @('encrypt.java'), but instead verifies the output of the Java compiler,
i.e., @('encrypt.class').  Normally we would need to build @('encrypt.class')
whenever @('encrypt.java') is updated, by running a command like</p>

@({
    $ javac encrypt.java
})

<p>We can still use a @('depends-on') comment to tell @('cert.pl') that our
ACL2 book depends on @('encrypt.class'), e.g.,</p>

@({
    ; (depends-on \"encrypt.class\")
    (defconsts (*class-file* state)
      (read-java-class-file \"encrypt.class\"))
})

<p>This is better than nothing.  @('cert.pl') will at least know it needs to
recertify our ACL2 book if the @('.class') file changes.  However, there's no
way to tell @('cert.pl') that this @('.class') file also depends on
@('encrypt.java'), so editing @('encrypt.java') won't be enough to trigger a
recertification.</p>

<p>When your project gets to this point&mdash;needing a build system that can
deal with both ACL2 books and other kinds of files&mdash;you have exceeded the
ability of @('cert.pl') as a purely standalone tool.  It now becomes a tool
to help you write a Makefile for your whole project.</p>")

avoid needing to write any Makefiles.  But sometimes it's not enough.  For
instance:</p>

<ul>

<li>If your project involves dynamically generating new ACL2 books,
@('cert.pl') has no way to see their dependencies.</li>

<li>If your project has a non-ACL2 component that needs to be built in some
special way, e.g., say you're linking ACL2 with a C library and you need to
recompile the library when you change its code, @('cert.pl') has no support for
building the C library.</li>

</ul>

<p>In these cases, the general approach is to write an ordinary @('Makefile'),
but use @('cert.pl') to automate the dependency scanning for all of the static
ACL2 books.</p>


<h3>Basic Makefile Generation</h3>

<p>Ordinarily, when you run a command like @('cert.pl foo'), what happens
is:</p>

<ul>

<li>@('cert.pl') scans @('foo') for @(see include-book) commands, etc., to
figure out the dependencies of @('foo').</li>

<li>It writes these dependencies into a temporary Makefile named
@('Makefile-tmp').</li>

<li>It invokes @('make') on @('Makefile-tmp') to do the actual build.</li>

</ul>

<p>When you use @('cert.pl') as part of your own Makefile, you don't want it to
run @('make') for you.  Instead, you just want it to do the dependency analysis
and write out a Makefile that your Makefile can <a
href='http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Include'>include</a>.</p>

<p>This is done using the @('-s') switch.  For instance, here's how we could
create a Makefile for the @('arithmetic-5') library:</p>

@({
    $ cd acl2/books/arithmetic-5
    $ cert.pl top.cert -s Makefile-arith5
})

<p>The resulting Makefile has all the dependencies for Arithmetic-5:</p>

@({

    # cert.pl top.cert -s Makefile-arith5
    ...
    ACL2_SYSTEM_BOOKS ?= ..                      # Boilerplate stuff
    export ACL2_BIN_DIR := ../../cn/e/bin
    include $(ACL2_SYSTEM_BOOKS)/build/make_cert

    .PHONY: all-cert-pl-certs

    all-cert-pl-certs: $(CERT_PL_CERTS)

        lib/basic-ops/default-hint.cert \
        lib/basic-ops/integerp-helper.lisp
    ...
})

<p>The general idea is then to include the generated @('Makefile') into your
own Makefile.  For real examples of how to do this, see</p>

<ul>

<li>The @('books/Makefile'); just search for @('cert.pl') to see how it is used

          would invalidate a certificate"
  :long "<p>In principle, every time the ACL2 system changes, all books should
be recertified.  However, in practice many users don't do this because the ACL2
system is updated frequently and it is time-consuming to rebuild all the
community books.  But sometimes a change to the ACL2 system makes certain books
no longer work correctly until they are recertified.  For example, the book
@('system/apply/apply-prim') uses the value of
@('*first-order-like-terms-and-out-arities*'), a constant defined by the ACL2
system, in a make-event form in order to define @('apply$-prim-meta-fn-ev').
If the value of that constant changes, that book should be recertified;
otherwise, books that depend on it might fail to certify.</p>

<p>The @('GNUMakefile') provided with the ACL2 community books provides a
mechanism to force certain books to be recertified when the values of constants
built into the ACL2 system change.  To fix @('apply-prim') using this
mechanism, we add a comment to the book:</p>
@({
 ; (depends-on \"build/first-order-like-terms-and-out-arities.certdep\" :dir :system)
 })

<p>This forces @('apply-prim') to be recertified if that file changes. We
arrange for this file to change by running ACL2 at the start of each invocation
of the community books' @('GNUMakefile') and comparing the value of
@('*first-order-like-terms-and-out-arities*') to the object read from
@('build/first-order-like-terms-and-out-arities.certdep').  If those objects
differ, then the current @('*first-order-like-terms-and-out-arities*') is
written to that file, which then forces @('apply-prim') to be recertified.</p>

<p>It is fairly easy to add dependencies on other ACL2 features: simply add a
new invocation of @('write-file-if-obj-differs') to
@('build/cert_features.lsp'), similar to the ones that already exist there.
For example, the one used in the example above is:</p>
@({
 (write-file-if-obj-differs \"first-order-like-terms-and-out-arities.certdep\"
                            *first-order-like-terms-and-out-arities*
                            state)
 })
<p>Then add dependencies using @('depends-on') comments in the books that
depend on the current value of that constant.</p>

<p>The cert.pl build system by itself does not update these files, which means
that Makefiles that use cert.pl will not support this feature unless they run
the @('cert_features.lsp') script on startup, like @('books/GNUMakefile') does.
A workaround is to invoke @('books/GNUMakefile') after any rebuild of ACL2,
before using cert.pl alone or using a separate Makefile:</p>
@({
 cd acl2/books
 make build/Makefile-features
 })
<p>Cert.pl and cert.pl-generated Makefiles will arrange for files
@('build/%.certdep') to be created if they do not exist, so that books that
depend on them can still be certified using cert.pl alone.</p>

<p>Cert.pl also makes every certificate depend on two special certdep files:
@('build/acl2-version.certdep') and @('build/universal-dependency.certdep').
The former is updated by @('cert_features.lsp') like the others, containing the
current ACL2 version string; this forces all books to be recertified when the
ACL2 version number changes.  The latter, unlike the others, is stored in the
ACL2 git repository.  It may be updated by ACL2 maintainers to force all books
to be recertified when they make other changes that require this, or by
community members who notice that such a change has been made without a
corresponding update.</p>")

  :short "(Advanced) how to get @(see cert.pl) to use @(see save-exec) images
to certify parts of your project."

  :long "<p>In most ACL2 projects, each book uses @(see include-book) to load
all of its dependencies, and the same, \"stock\" ACL2 executable is used to
certify every book.  This generally works well and certainly keeps things
simple.</p>

<p>By default, @('cert.pl') will simply try to certify all books using whatever
ACL2 image is invoked with @('acl2'), or else whatever image it is told to use
via the @('$ACL2') environment variable or the @('--acl2') option; see
<i>Helping @('cert.pl') find ACL2</i> of @(see preliminaries) for
details.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this usual approach means that widely included books must be
loaded repeatedly.  As your project grows, you may eventually find that you are
spending a lot of time waiting for @(see include-book) commands.  One way to
combat this is to use @(see save-exec) to write out a new ACL2 image that has
your supporting books pre-loaded.  These extended ACL2 images can be re-started
instantly.  For interactive development, images can be a very convenient way to
quickly get back into a good starting place, with your supporting books already
loaded.  Meanwhile, using images to re-certify books can significantly reduce
the time spent waiting for @(see include-book) commands to finish.</p>

<p>@('cert.pl') supports using extended images for certain books.  For this to
work, you will need to get a few pieces working together.  The notes below
explain the basics of how to set this up.  See also
@('projects/milawa/ACL2/Makefile') for a working example of a project that uses
around a dozen images to certify various directories of files.</p>

<h3>Image Creation</h3>

<p>Suppose you want to use @(see save-exec) to create an extended ACL2 image
using the following script:</p>

@({
     ;; make-extended-acl2.lsp
     (in-package \"ACL2\")
     (include-book \"support\")
     :q
     (save-exec \"extended-acl2\" \"Supporting libraries pre-loaded.\")
})

<p>While @('cert.pl') does have good support for using the resulting image to
certify particular books, there is currently no way to directly tell
@('cert.pl') that it needs to run this script to create the @('extended-acl2')
image.  Instead, if you want to use extended ACL2 images, you will probably
need to put together a @('Makefile').  See @(see static-makefiles) for
information about how to use @('cert.pl') to do the dependency scanning for
your @('Makefile').</p>

<p>In your @('Makefile'), you can easily explain what the dependencies of
@('extended-acl2') are, and how to build it, e.g., as follows:</p>

@({
     extended-acl2: support.cert make-extended-acl2.lsp
         @rm -f extended-acl2
         $(ACL2) < make-extended-acl2.lsp &> extended-acl2.out
         ls -l extended-acl2
})


<h3>Helping @('cert.pl') find your Images</h3>

<p>For @('cert.pl') to find @('extended-acl2'), the easiest thing to do is make
sure that it is located somewhere in your @('$PATH'), and we especially
recommend this option if you are going to be invoking @('cert.pl')
interactively, i.e., not exclusively from your @('Makefile').</p>

<p>Alternately, @('cert.pl') accepts a @('--bin') option that can be used to
indicate which directory will contain images.</p>


<h3>Specifying the Image for each Book</h3>

<p>To decide what image to use to certify @('foo.lisp'), @('cert.pl') will
first look for a file named @('foo.image').  This file should contain a single
line that just gives the name of the ACL2 image to use.  For instance, if we
want to certify @('foo.lisp') using @('extended-acl2'), then @('foo.image')
should simply contain:</p>

@({
     extended-acl2
})

<p>You can also write a @('cert.image') file to indicate a directory-wide
default image to use.  (This is exactly analogous to how @('cert.pl') looks for
@('.acl2') files for @(see pre-certify-book-commands).)</p>")


(defxdoc distributed-builds ; Step 8

  :short "(Advanced) how to distribute ACL2 book building over a cluster
of machines."

  :long "<p>Warning: getting a cluster set up and running smoothly is a
significant undertaking.  Aside from hardware costs, it may take significant
energy to install and administer the system, and you will need to learn how to
effectively use the queuing system.  You'll probably also need to be ready to
do some scripting to work around dumb problems.  Think of this topic as:
<i>some hints that may help you</i>, not <i>a usable guide to setting up a
cluster.</i></p>

<p>At Centaur, @('cert.pl') is successfully used within a <a
href='http://www.rocksclusters.org/'>rocks</a> cluster environment,
using the open-source queuing system <a
href='http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/support/download-center/torque-download/'>torque</a>
and the <a
href='http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/products/open-source/maui/'>maui</a>
scheduler.  This clustering software allows for the submission of <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Batch_System'>PBS</a> scripts as
jobs.  To support this cluster, @('cert.pl') has certain features.</p>


<h3>Support for PBS directives</h3>

<p>For one, @('cert.pl') writes out a PBS script for each book it is going to
certify.  These scripts look like ordinary shell scripts (so they work fine for
use in non-cluster environments), but they contain special comments that the
clustering software understands.</p>

<p>These comments allow you to say, e.g., how much memory a job is going to
take, so that if a job takes more than its allotted memory, the clustering
software may choose to kill it.  The clustering software also uses this memory
limit to ensure that when it allocates a job to a machine, the machine will
have enough physical machine to run the job.</p>

<p>This is really very useful.  If you let a machine start swapping into the
gigabytes, at worst you will need to physically reset it, because it dies a
special kind of horrible death where its load average is 50 and you can't even
\"kill\" anything.  In a slightly better case, you may run into the Linux
overcommit and OOM killer features, which are also really awful.  My favorite
article on the topic, from back before we had the cluster and were running into
this frequently, is <a
href='http://thoughts.davisjeff.com/2009/11/29/linux-oom-killer/'>here</a>.</p>

<p>At any rate, when cert.pl writes out the scripts to certify books, it
includes some PBS commands that say how much memory the book is expected to
take. This is done by a stupid heuristic: we search for @('set-max-mem') lines;
if no such line is found we say the book will take 4 GB, and otherwise we
reserve I think 2-3 GB more than the set-max-mem line calls for. This extra
padding is because set-max-mem only affects the heap, and doesn't account for
the stacks, and we typically build a CCL image with large stacks, as explained
in centaur/ccl-config.lsp, and also because set-max-mem is sort of best thought
of as a soft cap, anyway.</p>


<h3>Support for a Queuing System</h3>

<p>Besides this support for PBS directives, @('cert.pl') also consults an
environment variable @('$STARTJOB').  If this variable isn't set, we default it
to your current @('$SHELL').  When we run ACL2 jobs, we basically use:</p>

@({
    $STARTJOB -c \"acl2 < certify-commands &> foo.cert.out\"
})

<p>So, given a suitable @('startjob') command, @('cert.pl') can automatically
distribute the jobs to your cluster.  A suitable command is one that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Accepts the @('-c') syntax or (without @('-c')) accepts a script.</li>
<li>Waits for the job to finish.</li>
<li>Exits \"transparently\", i.e., with the exit code of the job.</li>
</ul>

<p>A suitable @('startjob') command does not need to support any input/output
redirection; we embed that into the command itself.</p>


<h3>Support for NFS Lag</h3>

<p>We originally found that our builds would often \"fail\" due to the
following scenario:</p>

<ul>
<li>Head node: Makefile submits book A to the queue.</li>
<li>Compute node: Certifies book A successfully.</li>
<li>Head node: startjob returns control to the Makefile.</li>
<li>Head node: Makefile runs @('ls A.cert') to check success.</li>
<li>Head node: @('ls') fails because NFS isn't up to date.</li>
<li>Make thinks there's been a problem and dies.</li>
<li>Moments later @('A.cert') shows up.</li>
</ul>

<p>To avoid this, @('cert.pl') now has special support for NFS lag.  We now use
exit codes instead of files to determine success.  In cases where the exit code
says the job completed successfully, we wait until @('A.cert') becomes visible
to the head node before returning control to the Makefile.</p>")

 certification of the indicated book but also apply to all books that include
 it (and recursively).</p>

 <ul>

 <li>@('acl2x'): use two-pass certification (see @(see set-write-acl2x))</li>

 <li>@('acl2xskip'): use @(tsee skip-proofs) during two-pass certification</li>

 <li>@('ansi-only'): only certify when the host Lisp is an ANSI Common
 Lisp (hence, not an older version of GCL)</li>

 <li>@('ccl-only'): only certify when the host Lisp is CCL</li>

 <li>@('hons-only'): only certify when special @(tsee hons) support is
 available (now always the case; required ACL2(h) until the @(see
 acl2::hons-and-memoization) features were incorporated into ACL2)</li>

 <li>@('non-acl2r'): only certify when the (@see real) numbers are NOT
 supported, i.e., when NOT using ACL2(r)</li>

 <li>@('reloc_stub'): print a suitable ``relocation stub'' warning</li>

 <li>@('uses-acl2r'): only certify when the (@see real) numbers are supported,
 i.e., with ACL2(r)</li>

 <li>@('uses-glucose'): only certify when Glucose (a SAT solver) is
 available</li>

 <li>@('uses-quicklisp'): only certify when quicklisp is available</li>

  :long "<p>Ifdef and @(see ifndef), defined in \"books/build/ifdef.lisp\",
support conditionally running some events depending on the build environment.
This works as follows:</p>

@({
 (ifdef \"MY_ENV_VAR\"
    (defun foo (x) x)
    (include-book \"bar\")
    :endif)
 })
<p>produces the given defun and include-book events only if \"MY_ENV_VAR\" is
defined in the environment and is not the empty string.  @(see Ifndef) has the
opposite behavior.</p>

<p>There is special support in the @(see build::cert.pl) build system for these
constructs, so that if the environment in which the cert.pl scan is run matches
the environment in which the ACL2 job is run, the build system will know the
true dependencies of the file, taking ifdefs into account.</p>

<p>For this to work correctly, it is important to write the ifdef forms in a
standard manner, as shown above: the @('(ifdef \"VARNAME\"') must be on a
single line with nothing preceding it, and the @(':endif)') should be on a line
without any other dependency-relevant items.  E.g., the following will not work
as expected:</p>
@({
 (ifdef \"USE_FOO\" (include-book \"foo\") :endif)
 })
