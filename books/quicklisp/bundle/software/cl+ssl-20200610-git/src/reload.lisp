;;;     the actual sources

;; Windows builds have been naming librypto and libssl DLLs in several different ways:
;;
;; - libeay32.dll, libssl32.dll
;; - libeay32.dll, ssleay32.dll
;;
;; Note, the above names were used both for 32 and 64 -bit versions.
;;
;; - libcrypto-1_1-x64.dll, libssl-1_1-x64.dll
;;
;; The above are used for 64-bit only.
;;
;; - libcrypto-1_1.dll, libssl-1_1.dll
;;
;; These are 32-bit only.
