# Installation

## Using Quicklisp

1. Install quicklisp
2. Use quicklisp to install local-time

      (ql:quickload :local-time)

## Manual Installation

1. Make sure the ASDF library is loaded.  In SBCL, this involves:

      (require :asdf)

2. Add the path to the directory containing local-time.asd to
   asdf:*central-registry*.  If you've installed this package using
   asdf-install, this shouldn't be necessary.

      (push "/my/local-time/directory/" asdf:*central-registry*)

3. Load local-time using ASDF:

      (asdf:load-system 'local-time)

4. In your own projects, you can direct asdf to automatically load
   LOCAL-TIME with the :depends-on asdf:defsystem directive.

      (defsystem myproject
          :depends-on (local-time)
          ...)

## Testing

local-time uses Stefil for testing. To run the Stefil test suite, do
the following:-

    (ql:quickload :hu.dwim.stefil)
    (asdf:test-system 'local-time)
