# Prevent automatic newline conversion to CRLF by
# the default Git setup on Windows because
# SBCL can't load such files when Return is embedded
# in format directives. https://bugs.launchpad.net/sbcl/+bug/720517.
# (some of our code includes newlins in format directives, like
# the +default-cipher-list+ constant definition.
