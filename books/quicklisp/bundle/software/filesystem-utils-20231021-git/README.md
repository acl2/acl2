## About Filesystem-Utils
This is an extension library to pathname-utils, to allow dealing with common problems with filesystems, such as listing files, probing file types, determining default directories, etc.

## How To
Since this is a purely utility/toolkit library, simply having a look at the symbol index should give you the best idea of what is offered.
