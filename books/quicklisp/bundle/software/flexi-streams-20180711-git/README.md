FLEXI-STREAMS - Flexible bivalent streams for Common Lisp
---------------------------------------------------------

FLEXI-STREAMS implements "virtual" bivalent streams that can be
layered atop real binary or bivalent streams and that can be used to
read and write character data in various single- or multi-octet
encodings which can be changed on the fly. It also supplies in-memory
binary streams which are similar to string streams.

Complete documentation for CL-INTERPOL can be found in the `docs`
directory or at the [project documentation site](https://edicl.github.io/flexi-streams/).
