Installation of HTML-TEMPLATE

1. Probably the easiest way is

     (load "/path/to/html-template/load.lisp")

   This should compile and load HTML-TEMPLATE on most Common Lisp
   implementations.

2. With MK:DEFSYSTEM you can make a symlink from 'html-template.system'
   to your central registry and then issue the command

     (mk:compile-system "html-template")

   Note that this relies on TRUENAME returning the original file a
   symbolic link is pointing to. With AllegroCL 6.2 this will only
   work if you've applied all patches with (SYS:UPDATE-ALLEGRO).

3. You can also use ASDF instead of MK:DEFSYSTEM in a similar way:

     (asdf:operate 'asdf:compile-op :html-template)
     (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :html-template)

After installing HTML-TEMPLATE you can LOAD the file "test.lisp" to
check if everything works as expected.

Complete documentation for HTML-TEMPLATE can be found in the 'doc'
directory.

HTML-TEMPLATE also supports Nikodemus Siivola's HYPERDOC, see
<http://common-lisp.net/project/hyperdoc/> and
<http://www.cliki.net/hyperdoc>.
