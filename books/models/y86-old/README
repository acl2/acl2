This directory contains subdirectories for y86 models, as described
below.  See the file, LICENSE, for copyright and authorship
information.

Note that books under this directory are intended for certification
with the HONS version of ACL2 (ACL2(h), ACL2(hp), etc.); otherwise
certification may take a very long time.

Each top-level subdirectory has a README file containing more
information.

Current contents:

y86-basic/
	A very simple microprocessor model for the Y86 ISA,
	which is an X86-like ISA

y86-two-level/
	A variant of y86-basic/ that uses space-efficient memory

y86-two-level-abs/
	A variant of y86-two-level/ that uses abstract stobjs for
	reasoning and execution efficiency (thus, this is a variant of
	y86-basic/ that uses both space-efficient memory and abstract
	stobjs)
