; Use of Tail-Recursion to Propagate Inductive Assertions
; J Strother Moore
; February 26, 2003

; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Summary

; In this file I show how to use the classic inductive invariant
; approach to prove a partial correctness property of m5 programs.
; We deal with both iterative and recursive methods.

; To use the inductive invariant method with an operational semantics
; you define the invariant characterizing the reachable states of
; interest (i.e., given whatever pre-condition you wish to impose).
; Suppose the invariant is (inv s n0), where n0 is the ``initial
; values'' of the locals.  Then the next step is to prove that
; it is, indeed, an invariant, by proving that

; (implies (inv s n0) (inv (step s) n0)).    [1]

; From this it follows that

; (implies (inv s n0) (inv (run k s) n0)).

; Note that if you then plug in an initial state satisfying the
; invariant, and you suppose that after some arbitrary run the pc is
; at some location, you can read out of the invariant what you must
; know about that state.

; I'll get more specific below.

; In the past when I've used this technique, e.g., to do the
; Apprentice problem, I had to supply an explicit assertion for every
; pc.  Whether you do it explicitly or not, the invariant must
; characterize every pc or else you won't be able to prove [1].

; But the classic inductive assertion method supplies an assertion
; only for selected cut points (one for each loop, plus the pre- and
; post-conditions).

; In this file I demonstrate how to be explicit only at the cut
; points.  I use recursion by step in inv to define the invariant for
; all the states between cut points.  Even this idea is not new for
; me.  But in my previous uses of this idea -- the idea of using
; recursion by step to define the invariant at pcs other than the cut
; points -- you get the problem of how to ADMIT the inv function
; itself.  To admit such a recursive inv you have to prove that every
; step reduces the distance to some cut point.  That is, ACL2 imposes
; a proof burden not incurred by an ordinary user of inductive
; assertions.  (Such a user had to supply enough cut points but you
; knew you had done so if the verification condition generator
; terminated.)  My ``insight'' is that I could use defpun to define
; the invariant, using tail-recursion by step.

; A technique similar in spirit to the one I'm describing was used by
; Pete Manolios to attack the 2-Job version of the Apprentice problem.
; There, he defined the reachable states of the Apprentice problem as
; all the states that could be reached from certain states by the
; execution of a fixed maximum number of steps (25?).

; The contribution I see for this little note is the use of defpun to
; avoid counting.

; Now I'll do it...

; Our First Program

; Below is an m5 program that decrements its first local, n, by 2 and
; iterates until the result is 0.  On each iteration it adds 1 to a
; local variable, a, which is initialized to 0.  Thus, the method
; computes n/2, when n is even.  It does not terminate when n is odd.

; To make the program slightly simpler to deal with, I only consider
; the case where n is a non-negative int.  Note that the program still
; may loop forever under this pre-condition.  In fact, if n is a
; negative int, the iteration eventually wraps around and n becomes
; positive.  I could therefore eliminate the restriction on the sign
; of n and still get both occasional termination and occasional
; non-termination.  If n is not an int, it becomes an int after one
; iteration because of m5's use of int-fix on every operation.  Thus,
; I believe I could eliminate the pre-conditions on n altogether.
; However, that only involves me in int-ring arithmetic.  The
; non-negative int case exhibits all the interesting behavior.

; The Assertions at the Three Cut Points

; We will use a classic ``inductive assertion'' method.  The following
; function takes a state, s, and the ``initial'' value of n, n0, and
; states the assertions we wish to attach to pcs 0, 2, and 18.  These
; are the so-called ``cut points'' of my choice: the entry to the
; program, the top of the loop, and exit from the program.

; The particular assertions are not my main interest in this paper.
; You can read them if you want.  The real nugget in this paper is not
; the assertions but the fact that I use tail recursion by step to
; propagate assertions from the cut points to all the pcs.

; That said, let me note that the assertions are complicated because
; they have to handle the fact that halfa tracks the program only as
; long as n stays non-negative.  Things would be simpler if I assumed
; that n0 was even.  But I like illustrating the capability of
; establishing conditions that hold for n0 in the event of
; termination.

(defun half-assertion (th s n0)
  (let ((n (nth 0 (locals (top-frame th s))))
        (a (nth 1 (locals (top-frame th s))))
        (stack (stack (top-frame th s))))
    (and (equal (program (top-frame th s)) *half-prog*)
         (case (pc (top-frame th s))
           (0 (and (equal n n0)
                   (intp n0)
                   (<= 0 n0)))
           (2 (and (intp n0)
                   (<= 0 n0)
                   (intp n)
                   (if (and (<= 0 n)
                            (evenp n))
                       (equal (halfa n a)
                              (halfa n0 0))
                     (not (evenp n)))
                   (iff (evenp n0) (evenp n))))
           (18 (and (evenp n0)
                    (equal (top stack) (halfa n0 0))))
           (otherwise nil)))))

; Observe that the output condition is that n0 is even and that the
; top of the stack contains the semantic expression (halfa n0 0).
; We will later convert this to n0/2.

; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
; The Invariant -- The Only New Idea in this Note

; Here is the new idea.  I define the invariant for the program by
; using defpun.  The assertions are attached at the three cut points
; and all other statements inherit the invariant of the next
; statement.

(defpun half-inv (th s n0)
  (if (or (equal (pc (top-frame th s)) 0)
          (equal (pc (top-frame th s)) 2)
          (equal (pc (top-frame th s)) 18))
      (half-assertion th s n0)
    (half-inv th (step th s) n0)))

; In one sense, the next lemma is just a technical lemma to force
; half-inv to keep opening if it hasn't reached a cut point yet.  But
; in another sense, this lemma highlights the nice feature of this
; approach.  Suppose that in our function half-assertion we had failed
; to supply a cut point for some loop.  Then we'll get a stack
; overflow from the repeated indefinite application of this rewrite
; rule.  But we do not have to prove we've cut every loop, because the
; half-inv function is tail recursive and so was admitted by defpun.

; In the past when I've used the classic inductive invariant approach
; and used recursion in half-inv to avoid an assertion at every pc, I
; had to invent some kind of measure (``distance to the next cut
; point'') to prove that I had cut every loop.  That annoyed me
; because in the classic inductive invariant approach that burden is
; merely pragmatic -- you had to cut every loop or you couldn't
; generate verification conditions.  But you didn't have to prove you
; had cut every loop.  In my past attempts to mimic this, I had to
; prove more stuff!

(defthm half-inv-make-state-opener
  (implies (and (equal s (make-state tt hp ct))
                (equal pc (pc (top-frame th s)))
                (syntaxp (quotep pc))
                (not (equal pc 0))
                (not (equal pc 2))
                (not (equal pc 18)))
           (equal (half-inv th (make-state tt hp ct) n0)
                  (half-inv th (step th (make-state tt hp ct)) n0))))

; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Proofs

; So here is the key theorem of the inductive invariant approach, showing
; that inv is an invariant.

(defthm half-inv-step
  (implies (half-inv th s n0)
           (half-inv th (step th s) n0)))

; We can immediately conclude that half-inv is an invariant under run,
; as long as the only thread we step is th.

  :hints (("Goal" :in-theory (e/d (run)(half-inv-def)))))

; And so we're done.  If we plug in an initial state satisfying the
; invariant we get a final state satisfying it.  If the final state is
; supposed to have pc 18, then we can read out what the invariant
; tells us about that cut point.

; we have already done, just to have the *demo-state* etc.

(include-book "jvm-fact-setup")

; The following function recognizes the call stack (cs) of a call of
; the "fact" method on n0.  The function is not applied to the
; top-most frame, because the constraints on the frame are so
; pc-sensitive and the top-most frame may have "any" pc.  So the
; function actually recognizes the rest of the "fact" call stack.
; Here is a picture of the entire call stack.

; -------------------   top-most frame
; pc:       any
; locals:   (n)          5  <- suppose n=5
; stack:    any
; program:  fact prog
; -------------------   caller-frame
; pc:       11
; locals:   (n+1)        6     this is caller-frame 3
; stack:    (n+1)
; program:  fact prog
; -------------------   caller-frame
; pc:       11
; locals:   (n+2)        7     this is caller-frame 2
; stack:    (n+2)
; program:  fact prog
; -------------------   caller-frame
; ...
; -------------------   caller-frame
; pc:       11
; locals:   (n0)         8  <- suppose n0 = 8 ; this is caller frame 1
; stack:    (n0)
; program:  fact prog
; -------------------   the frame below called fact on n0
; ...                   this is caller frame 0

; Note that there are n0-n fact caller frames.  We number them from
; n0-n down to 1.  Caller frame 0 is actually the ``external'' entry
; into fact on n0.  We don't know (or care) whether fact or some other
; program is running there.  Let k be the number of the caller frame.
; Then note that the value of n in that frame is n0-k+1.

; This assertion is a little different from the iterative version

; and get back into the program of interest with some weird

; Here is the main theorem.  It opens by letting s1 be a run-to-return
; of s0.  That particular call runs s0 with an abitrarily long
; schedule, sched.  Note that run-to-return does not always return a
; state that has returned to a shorter call-stack depth -- if the
; schedule is exhausted before that happens, the final state may still
; be as deep or deeper than the initial state.  In any case, s0 is the
; initial state and s1 is the final state.

; Now let's read the hypotheses of the implication.  There are five
; blocks of hypotheses.  The first says that n0 is a positive intp.
; The second says that the top-frame of thread th of s0 is a call of
; our "fact" method on n0.  The third says that the depth of the
; call-stack of thread th is greater than 1.  That means there is a
; frame under the call of "fact".  We will call that frame the
; ``caller's frame.''  Of course, if s1 has a shorter call-stack than
; s0, then the caller's frame will be its top-frame, since
; run-to-return stops as soon as we've returned to that depth.  The
; fourth says the schedule consists of nothing but th steps.  Note
; that otherwise we say nothing about the schedule -- it may be
; arbitrarily long.  The fifth block says that the depth of the call
; stack of s1 is less than that of s0, so we know the initial state
; did run long enough to return and hence, the caller's frame is the
; top-frame of s1.

; Then the conclusion is that (int-fix (! n0)) is on top of
; the stack of the caller's frame.
