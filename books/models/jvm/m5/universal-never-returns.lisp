; Some people leap to the conclusion that because ACL2 is a logic of
; total functions we can only deal with total programs.  That is, of
; course, a misunderstanding.

; In this book I prove that the universal program never terminates.
; This is not difficult and the only reason I prove it is to try to dispell
; the misunderstanding above.

; But the formalization raises problems.  What do we mean, "never
; terminates?"  I mean that once the universal program is invoked by a
; thread, th, then thread th forever stays in the universal program.
; By being "in the universal program" I mean that the program of the
; top frame of the thread is the universal one.

; The only sense in which this is a difficult proof is that we have to
; deal with the effects of arbitrarily many other threads running
; arbitrarily many other programs.  Can they do anything to mess up
; thread th?  Actually they can, e.g., they can run the native "stop"
; method on it.  That won't actually affect the program in the top
; frame of th, so our conjecture holds in the face of such an assault.

; But the most insideous thing another thread can do, it turns out, is
; to execute NEW on a class name that extends threads, in such a way
; that the new thread object created IS th.  This would change the top
; frame of th.  Of course, this cannot happen if th is an extant
; thread at the time the NEW was executed.  But it is for that reason
; that I have had to say that th is a legal thread identifier (a
; natural number less than the length of the thread-table) rather than
; leave it unrestricted.
