  :short "Discussion on how to use unsigned-byte-p"
  :long "<p>@(csee unsigned-byte-p) (and @(see signed-byte-p) for that matter) are
  tricky enough that there is no one-size-fits-all solution that everyone
  should use to reason about them.  Depending on your problem you might try any
  of these strategies:</p>

  <ol>

  <li><i>Arithmetic</i> -- Leave unsigned-byte-p's regular definition enabled
  and try to reason about the resulting inequalities.  This sometimes works and
  may be a good approach if you have goals involving \"non bit-vector
  functions\" like +, *, /, etc.  I usually don't use this approach but I
  haven't done a lot of proofs about true arithmetic functions.</li>

  <li><i>Induction</i> -- Disable unsigned-byte-p's regular definition but
  instead enable an alternate definition, e.g., the
  centaur/bitops/ihsext-basics book has unsigned-byte-p**, which is a recursive
  version that works well for induction.  This definition is in the
  ihsext-recursive-redefs ruleset and also works well with other ** definitions
  like logand**.  This is often a good strategy when proving lemmas about
  unsigned-byte-p but is probably mainly useful when reasoning about new
  recursive functions.</li>

  <li><i>Vector</i> -- Leave @(see unsigned-byte-p) disabled except to prove
  lemmas, and expect to reason about (unsigned-byte-p n x) via lemmas.  I think
  I usually prefer this strategy as it feels more reliable/less magical than
  reasoning about arithmetic inequalities.  Some useful books:

    <ol>

      <li>bitops/ihsext-basics proves the nice/obvious lemmas about
      signed/unsigned-byte-p on many bit-vector functions like logior,
      logand, etc.</li>

      <li>bitops/signed-byte-p has lemmas about signed/unsigned-byte-p for
      some arithmetic functions (+, -, *) and also extended lemmas about
      bit-vector stuff.  It's often very handy for the kinds of guard
      obligations that arise from things like (the (unsigned-byte 32)
      x).</li>

    </ol></li>
  </ol>

  <p>We have occasionally written wrapper functions like @('u32p'), but, I
  think that perhaps the only reason we did this was for macros like @(see
  def-typed-record), where we needed a unary predicate to introduce a fancier
  data structure.  Once we had the typed records in place, we just enabled
  these wrappers and did all our reasoning about @(see unsigned-byte-p).
  (I don't think you'd want to reason about a each various u32p, u64p, etc.,
  individually.)</p>

  <p>In the context of FTY, I don't think you need wrappers, but if for some
  reason you do want to use them then that is probably basically fine.  Note
  here that you have some choice for your fixing function.  You can fix to 0 as
  you've done in your examples, but you might instead prefer to fix to
  @'(loghead n x)').  Why?  When you use loghead, it preserves the lower @('N')
  bits, and this may interact much more nicely with rules about true bit-vector
  functions.  This approach is also good for GL, where loghead is supported in
  an especially good way.</p>

  <p>That said, it should be possible to get by without wrappers; see for
  instance the definition of sizednum in centaur/fty/deftypes-tests.lisp, or
  the definition of vl-constint in centaur/vl/expr.lisp, both of which use a
  loghead-based approach to do the fixing.  (The vl-constint example has
  a :require that is an inequality instead of an unsigned-byte-p term, but I
  don't think there's any particular reason to do it this way instead of the
  other.)</p>

  <p>In general there is good reason to expect it to sometimes be hard to work
  with unsigned-byte-p.  For instance, consider a theorem like the following,
  from @('centaur/bitops/signed-byte-p.lisp'):</p>

  @({
   (defthm lousy-unsigned-byte-p-of-*-mixed
     ;; Probably won't ever unify with anything.
     (implies (and (unsigned-byte-p n1 a)
		   (unsigned-byte-p n2 b))
	      (unsigned-byte-p (+ n1 n2) (* a b)))
     :hints((\"Goal\" :use ((:instance upper-bound)))))
  })

  <p>This would be a good rule to try on goals like @('(unsigned-byte-p 10 (* a
  b))'), but without some insight into @('a') and @('b') it's hard to know how
  to successfully instantiate @('N1/N2').  So you end up resorting to @(':use')
  hints, or special-case variants of this theorem (e.g., another theorem that
  says 7 bits * 3 bits --&gt; 10 bits), or you do something more sophisticated
  with bind-free or similar.</p>

  <p>If you find yourself going down this road, you might see in particular Dave
  Greve's \"Parameterized Congruences\" paper from the 2006 workshop, which is
  implemented in the coi/nary/nary.lisp book.  You could also look at Sol
  Swords' book to do something similar, see @(see contextual-rewriting).</p>")

  :short "A portable implementation and extension of Common Lisp byte
  functions."

  :long "<p>The proposed Common Lisp standard [<a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X3J13'>X3J13</a> Draft 14.10] defines a
number of functions that operate on subfields of integers.  These subfields are
specified by @('(BYTE size position)'), which \"indicates a byte of width size
and whose bits have weights @($2^{position+size-1}$) through @($2^{pos}$), and
whose representation is implementation dependent\".  Unfortunately, the
standard does not specify what BYTE returns, only that whatever is returned is
understood by the byte manipulation functions LDB, DPB, etc.</p>

<p>This lack of complete specification makes it impossible for ACL2 to specify
the byte manipulation functions of Common Lisp in a portable way.  For example
AKCL uses @('(cons size position)') as a byte specifier, whereas another
implementation might use a special data structure to represent @('(byte size
position)').  Since any theorem about the ACL2 built-ins is meant to be a
theorem for all Common Lisp implementations, ACL2 cannot define BYTE.</p>

<p>Therefore, we have provided a portable implementation of the byte operations
specified by the draft standard.  This behavior of this implementation should
be consistent with every Common Lisp that provides the standard byte
operations.  Our byte specifier @('(bsp size pos)') is analogous to CLTL's
@('(byte size pos)'), where size and pos are nonnegative integers.  Note that
the standard indicates that reading a byte of size 0 returns 0, and writing a
byte of size 0 leaves the destination unchanged.</p>

<p>This table indicates the correspondance between the Common Lisp byte
operations and our portable implementation:</p>

<li>A constant @('*<name>-MIN*'), set to the minimum value of the type.</li>

<li>A predicate, @('(<pred> x)'), that recognizes either @('(UNSIGNED-BYTE-P

coercion.</li>

<li>A lemma that reduces calls of the coercion function when its argument

<li>A forward chaining lemma from the predicate to the appropriate type

should be a symbol.  A function of this name will be defined to provide a
saturating coercion.  `Saturation' in this context means that values outside of
the legal range for the type are coerced to the type by setting them to the
nearest legal value, which will be either the minimum or maximum value of the

  :long "<p>Example:</p>

@({
    (DEFWORD FM9001-INSTRUCTION-WORD
      ((RN-A 4 0) (MODE-A 2 4) (IMMEDIATE 9 0) (A-IMMEDIATE 1 9)
       (RN-B 4 10) (MODE-B 2 14)
       (SET-FLAGS 4 16) (STORE-CC 4 20) (OP-CODE 4 24))
      :CONC-NAME ||
      :SET-CONC-NAME SET-)
})

<p>The above example defines the instruction word layout for the FM9001.  The
macro defines accessing macros (RN-A i), ... ,(OP-CODE i), updating
macros (SET-RN-A val i), ... ,(SET-OP-CODE val i), and a keyword updating
macro @('(UPDATE-FM9001-INSTRUCTION-WORD val &rest args)').</p>

<p>General form:</p>

@({
    (DEFWORD name struct &key conc-name set-conc-name keyword-updater)
})

<p>The DEFWORD macro defines a packed integer data structure, for example an
instruction word for a programmable processor or a status word.  DEFWORD is a
simple macro that defines accessing and updating macros for the fields of the
data structure. The utility of DEFWORD is mainly to simplify the specification
of packed integer data structures, and to improve the readability of code
manipulating these data structures without affecting performance. As long as
the book \"logops-lemmas\" is loaded all of the important facts about the macro
expansions should be available to the theorem prover.</p>

<p>Arguments</p>

@({
  name:  The name of the data structure, a symbol.

  struct : The field structure of the word. The form of this argument is
  given by the following grammar:

  <tuple>  := (<field> <size> <pos> [ <doc> ])
  <struct> := () | (<tuple> . <struct>)

  where:

  (SYMBOLP <field>)
  (AND (INTEGERP <size>) (> <size> 0))
  (AND (INTEGERP <pos>) (>= <pos> 0))
  (STRINGP <doc>)
})

<p>In other words, a list of tuples, the first element being a symbol, the
second a positive integer, the third a nonnegative integer, and the optional
fourth a string.</p>

<p>Note that there are few other requirements on the @('<struct>') other than
the syntactic ones above.  For example, the FM9001 DEFWORD shows that a word
may have more than one possible structure - the first 9 bits of the FM9001
instruction word are either an immediate value, or they include the RN-A and
MODE-A fields.</p>

<p>conc-name, set-conc-name: These are symbols whose print names will be
concatenated with the field names to produce the name of the accessors and
updaters respectively.  The default is @('<name>')- and @('SET-<name>')-
respectively.  The access and update macro names will be interned in the
package of name.</p>

<p>keyword-updater:  This is a symbol, and specifies the name of the keyword
updating macro (see below).  The default is @('UPDATE-<name>').</p>


<h3>Interpretation</h3>

<p>DEFWORD creates an ACL2 DEFLABEL event named @('<name>').</p>

<p>Each tuple @('(<field> <size> <pos>)') represents a @('<size>')-bit field of
a word at the bit position indicated.  Each field tuple produces an accessor
macro</p>

@({
  (<accessor> word)
})

<p>where @('<accessor>') is computed from the :conc-name (see above).  This
accessor will expand into:</p>

@({
  (RDB (BSP <size> <pos>) word).
})

<p>DEFWORD also generates an updating macro</p>

@({
  (<updater> val word)
})

<p>where @('<updater>') is computed from the :set-conc-name (see above).  This
macro will expand to</p>

@({
     (WRB val (BSP <size> <pos>) word)
})

<p>The keyword updater</p>

@({
  (<keyword-updater> word &rest args)
})

<p>is equivalent to multiple nested calls of the updaters on the initial word.
 For example,</p>

@({
  (UPDATE-FM9001-INSTRUCTION-WORD WORD :RN-A 10 :RN-B 12)
})

<p>is the same as @('(SET-RN-A 10 (SET-RN-B 12 WORD))').</p>")
