contain a theory of the logical operations on numbers defined by CLTL (Section
12.7), and a portable implementation of the CLTL byte manipulation
functions (Section 12.8).  These books also extend the CLTL logical operations
and byte manipulation theory with a few new definitions, lemmas supporting
those definitions, and useful macros.</p>

<p>These books were developed as a basis for the formal specification and
verification of hardware, where integers are used to represent binary signals
and busses.  These books should be general enough, however, to be used as a
basis for reasoning about packed data structures, bit-encoded sets, and other
applications of logical operations on integers.</p>")

  :long "<p>This book, along with @(see logops-lemmas), includes a theory of
the Common Lisp logical operations on numbers, a portable implementation of the
Common Lisp byte operations, extensions to those theories, and some useful
macros.</p>

<p>This book contains only definitions, lemmas necessary to admit those
definitions, and selected type lemmas.  By \"type lemmas\" we mean any lemmas
about the logical operations that we have found necessary to verify the guards
of functions that use these operations.  We have separated these \"type
lemmas\" from the large body of other lemmas in @(see logops-lemmas) to allow a
user to use this book to define guard-verified functions without having to also
include the extensive theory in @('logops-lemmas').</p>

<p>The standard Common Lisp logical operations on numbers are defined on the
signed integers, and return signed integers as appropriate.  This allows a high
level, signed interpretation of hardware operations if that is appropriate for
the specification at hand.  We also provide unsigned versions of several of the
standard logical operations for use in specifications where fixed-length
unsigned integers are used to model hardware registers and busses.  This view
of hardware is used, for example, in Yuan Yu's Nqthm specification of the
Motorola MC68020.</p>")
