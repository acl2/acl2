Synopsis
--------

This book presents a collection of macros to aid in reasoning about
ACL2 functions via refinement.  The idea of refinement (illustrated in
a recent work in progress by Bill Legato) is the following.  We start
with an abstract specification and program, showing that the abstract
specification is satisfied by the abstract program.  We then continue
to refine the specification and the program until we finally reach a
concrete implementation.  At each intermediate step we have an
intermediate specification and an intermediate program.  What this
approach guarantees is that the program satisfies the corresponding
specification at each stage of the refinement process.  Thus there is
a smaller gap to bridge at any level.

It is worth noting that a typical theorem proving effort often
proceeds by "re-creating" the intermediate functions and proving
appropriate properties.  What the proposal saves (I believe) is the
creative reverse-engineering involved in defining the intermediate
steps, and also makes the programmer's intention much clearer.

Contents
--------

So what does this book do?  We provide tools to help an ACL2 user
develop refinement-style programs.  Right now there is no support to
automate the creative reasoning involved --- although that is
certainly something we can and should do.  (That support will require
the refinement tool to have access to libraries, and generate an
intermediate refinement by looking at the component definitions in the
libraries.  The process can be seen as analogous to compilation.)
Rather, the support presented here is in the form of constructs that
help the user manage the theory while developing intermediate
refinements.  That is, it takes care of questions such as "Did I
*really* perform an appropriate refinement?"  "Are there missing
constraints?", etc.   At the logical level the tools here can be
viewed as no more than structuring the process of refinement.  But I
found structuring and discipline to be useful in formal verification
in general, and I'm hoping that they will be useful here.

The tools in this book consist of the following macros:

1. defabstraction: Produce the first specification for a program

2. defrefine: Produce a list of functions that refine a previously
              produced abstraction.  The executable definition of
              these functions is not exported, but these functions are
              constrained to (i)~refine the previous abstraction, and any
              other additional property of the functions that one
              wishes to introduce.

3. defexecutable: Final concrete definition.  It is shown to produce
                  a refinement of a previous abstraction.  The
                  difference between a defexecutable and defrefine is
                  that a defexecutable cannot be further refined
                  as it is assumed to be in the concrete definition.
                  The reason is that we wanted executable definitions
                  and for simulation and stuff of the final product.


Observation
-----------

One of the concerns about ACL2 is that the logic is not higher-order.
This often stifles some of the reasoning that we will like to do with
ACL2.  What this work shows (which is interesting to me) is that we
can emulate pretty much quite a bit of higher order reasoning in ACL2
by making use of features like table events and make-event.


Future Work
-----------

1.  Remove defexecutable and allow some form of simulation in the
    intermediate versions.

      I don't know what to do about this, but I have a feeling that
      defexecutable is not very useful because we want to refine
      anything anytime.  I have it right now, but will consider a
      better  design if I get the idea what will be better.

;; So how does this work?  First I create an "abstraction table".  The
;; entries in the abstraction table can be viewed as higher order
;; predicates that are then refined by other higher-order predicates.
;; The problem with this view is that the predicate is partial.

;; Observation: Note the table guard.  It says that we do not have a
;; deflabel event with the appropriate label.  This prevents the
;; possibility of "redefining" any entry in the table.
