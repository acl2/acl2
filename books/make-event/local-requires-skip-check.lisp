; This book should certify in spite of the fact that identity-macro is not
; around on the include-book pass of certify-book, yet we are supplying
; :check-expansion arguments.  (We omit some :check-expansion arguments too,
; just for fun.)  Inspection of the .cert file shows that it should only
; contain an entry for the last (8th) form in this file; see
; local-requires-skip-check-include.lisp.

(in-package "ACL2")

; The following book reads the .cert file of the present book.  So recertify
; the present book if the following book changes, in case that's because the
; format of .cert files has changed.
