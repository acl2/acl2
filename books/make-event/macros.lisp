; expansion occurs (and my-mac is local):
; (my-mac (make-event '(defun foo (x) x) :check-expansion (defun foo (x) x)))

; Note that the final event stored has a filled-in :check-expansion field but
; stores the original event in the first argument of record-expansion.

; The following encapsulate's expansion eliminates make-event from its
