*1 (the initial Goal, a key checkpoint) is pushed for proof by induction.

Perhaps we can prove *1 by induction.  Five induction schemes are suggested
by this conjecture.  These merge into two derived induction schemes.
However, one of these is flawed and so we are left with one viable
candidate.  

We will induct according to a scheme suggested by (REVAPPEND X Z),
but modified to accommodate (APPEND X Y).  These suggestions were produced
using the :induction rules BINARY-APPEND, REVAPPEND and TRUE-LISTP.
If we let (:P X Y Z) denote *1 above then the induction scheme we'll
use is
(AND (IMPLIES (AND (NOT (ENDP X))
                   (:P (CDR X) Y (CONS (CAR X) Z)))
              (:P X Y Z))
     (IMPLIES (ENDP X) (:P X Y Z))).
This induction is justified by the same argument used to admit REVAPPEND.
Note, however, that the unmeasured variable Z is being instantiated.
When applied to the goal at hand the above induction scheme produces
three nontautological subgoals.
Subgoal *1/3

ACL2 Warning [Equiv] in ( DEFTHM PERM-IS-AN-EQUIVALENCE ...):  Any
lemma about (PERM X Y), proved before PERM is marked as an equivalence
relation, is stored so as to rewrite (PERM X Y) to T.  After PERM is
known to be an equivalence relation, such a rule would rewrite the
left-hand side to the right-hand side, preserving PERM.  You have previously
proved one possibly problematic rule about PERM, namely PERM-DEL. 
After PERM is marked as an equivalence relation you should reconsider
this problematic rule.  If the rule is merely in support of establishing
that PERM is an equivalence relation, it may be appropriate to disable
it permanently hereafter.  If the rule is now intended to rewrite left
to right, you must prove the lemma again after PERM is known to be
an equivalence relation.

*1 (the initial Goal, a key checkpoint) is pushed for proof by induction.

Perhaps we can prove *1 by induction.  Three induction schemes are
suggested by this conjecture.  These merge into two derived induction
schemes.  However, one of these is flawed and so we are left with one
viable candidate.  

We will induct according to a scheme suggested by (APP X Y-EQUIV),
but modified to accommodate (APP X Y).  These suggestions were produced
using the :induction rule APP.  If we let (:P X Y Y-EQUIV) denote *1
above then the induction scheme we'll use is
(AND (IMPLIES (NOT (CONSP X))
              (:P X Y Y-EQUIV))
     (IMPLIES (AND (CONSP X) (:P (CDR X) Y Y-EQUIV))
              (:P X Y Y-EQUIV))).
This induction is justified by the same argument used to admit APP.
When applied to the goal at hand the above induction scheme produces
two nontautological subgoals.
Subgoal *1/2
Subgoal *1/1

*1 is COMPLETED!
Thus key checkpoint Goal is COMPLETED!

For the admission of PROPER-CONS-NEST-P we will use the relation O<
(which is known to be well-founded on the domain recognized by O-P)
and the measure (ACL2-COUNT X).  The non-trivial part of the measure
conjecture is

Goal
(IMPLIES (AND (NOT (SYMBOLP X))
              (EQ (CAR X) 'CONS))
         (O< (ACL2-COUNT (CADDR X))

Q.E.D.

That completes the proof of the measure theorem for PROPER-CONS-NEST-P.
Thus, we admit this function under the principle of definition.  We
observe that the type of PROPER-CONS-NEST-P is described by the theorem
(OR (EQUAL (PROPER-CONS-NEST-P X) T) (EQUAL (PROPER-CONS-NEST-P X) NIL)).

ACL2 Warning [Subsume] in ( DEFTHM

rule ORDERED-SYMBOL-ALISTP-REMOVE1-ASSOC-EQ subsumes a newly proposed
:REWRITE rule generated from ORDERED-SYMBOL-ALISTP-REMOVE1-ASSOC-EQ-TEST,
in the sense that the old rule rewrites a more general target.  Because
the new rule will be tried first, it may nonetheless find application.


Q.E.D.

The storage of ORDERED-SYMBOL-ALISTP-REMOVE1-ASSOC-EQ-TEST depends
upon the :type-prescription rule ORDERED-SYMBOL-ALISTP.
