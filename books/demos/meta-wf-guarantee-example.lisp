; Example of Well-Formedness Guarantee for a Metafunction
; Matt Kaufmann and J Strother Moore
; June, 2015

; To Recertify:
; (certify-book "meta-wf-guarantee-example" ? nil)

; SBCL does not have the capacity to handle this book as of June 2015 (and
; likely many later versions).  THe problem is with the definition bodies of
; val2 and val3 below, which are huge and can cause "Heap exhausted" failures.
; CCL doesn't have this problem; perhaps that because it compiles less
; aggressively (just a wild guess).  The other Lisps don't have this issue
; because they don't compile on the fly and meta-wf-guarantee-example.acl2
; specifies that this book is certified without compiling it.
; cert_param: (non-sbcl)

; About this Book

; We define a metafunction, prove its guards, prove a well-formedness guarantee
; for it, and prove it correct.  But in proving it correct we store it two
; different ways, once without the well-formedness guarantee and once with the
; guarantee.  We give these two metatheorems different names and disable them
; both, so that by enabling exactly one we can run the metafunction with or
; without the guarantee.

; Then we export three macros for testing the options so that you can see the
; metafunctions in action.

; One macro attempts to prove a certain test theorem without the metafunctions
; at all.  That will fail, thereby demonstrating that we do not have rewrite
; rules around sufficient to solve the problem.  Indeed, no finite set of
; rewrite rules -- or at least no such set we know! -- will do what our
; metafunction does.  Another purpose of this macro is to show you what the
; test theorem looks like.  You probably won't have the patience to watch
; the checkpoint print in full.  It contains about a million (boringly
; repetitious) function calls.

; The second macro proves the test theorem using the metafunction without
; guarantees.  The last macro proves it with the guarantee.  Both of the
; successful proofs print profiling information about the proofs.

; At the end of this book we define a clause-processor, prove a well-formedness
; guarantee for it, and prove it correct.

; How to Use This Book

; The best way to use it is first to read it and understand the metafunction we
; define, see how the well-formedness guarantee is proved, and how we can store
; the metafunction with or without a guarantee.  But then to test the
; metafunction you should do this:

; (include-book "meta-wf-guarantee-example" :load-compiled-file nil)
; (test-without-meta)   ; <--- WARNING: This fails and prints a huge checkpoint
; (test-without-guarantee)
; (test-with-guarantee)

; In each of the last two, search backwards for
; Summary
; Form:  ( THM ...)
; to find the Time taken for each proof.

; Summary of The Successful Macros

; We summarize below what we saw when running the two successful tests on a
; MacBook Pro laptop with a 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7 processor and 16 GB of 1600
; MHZ DDR3 memory, running Clozure Common Lisp.

; What we see from the above is that when run without guarantee, TERMP is
; called about 5 million times.  When run with the guarantee, TERMP is called 1
; time.  Every event causes at least 1 call of TERMP because of the way events
; macroexpand.

; We also see that the metafunction, which is named META-WR, is called 7 times
; in each proof.

; Furthermore, we see that in both proofs the 7 calls of META-WR took trivial
; time, when compared to the time of 0.43 seconds spent in TERMP in the proof
; without the well-formedness test: over four thousand times longer in TERMP
; than in the metafunction.

; The difference in the total proof times is not so dramatic, just 1.64 seconds
; versus 1.20 seconds.  That difference is almost entirely explained by the
; 0.43 seconds in TERMP.  Most of the proof time is spent in the rewriter,
; expanding the definitions that make the test theorem large.

; About the Metafunction Defined Here

; We first define a ``memory write'' function, (wr addr val mem) that
; deposits val at location addr in the linear list mem.

; (wr 5 'five '(0 I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX))
; = '(0 I II III IV FIVE VI VII VIII IX)

; An interesting property of this function is that if a new write shadows an
; old write to the same location, the old write can be eliminated, no matter
; what addresses might also have been written -- even if some of those other
; writes were to the same address.

; For example, suppose you have an ``old memory'' and you build a ``new memory''
; by doing a write that shadows one of the old ones:

; old mem:  (wr a2 v2 (wr a3 v3 (wr a1 v1 mem)))
; new mem:  (wr a1 new-v1 old-mem)

; Note that the write to a1 shadows the deepest write in the old memory.
; But we don't know whether the writes to a2 or a3 are shadowed or not.

; Logically the new memory is

; (wr a1 new-v1 (wr a2 v2 (wr a3 v3 (wr a1 v1 mem))))
;                                   ^^^^^^^^^
;                                   this write is
;                                   shadowed out by
;                                   the new wr

; and the challenge is to write a metafunction that reduces this to
; the simpler expression:

; (wr a1 new-v1 (wr a2 v2 (wr a3 v3 mem)))

; in which the shadowed write is eliminated.

; In our metafunction, which is called META-WR, we use a trick exploited in the
; Stateman book, to HIDE every write already processed so we don't resimplify
; an already processed memory expression.  Thus, a more accurate portrayal of
; what we'll see is:

; old mem:  (HIDE (wr a2 v2 (wr a3 v3 (wr a1 v1 mem))))
; new mem:  (wr a1 new-v1 old-mem)

; Logically this turns into

; (wr a1 new-v1 (HIDE (wr a2 v2 (wr a3 v3 (wr a1 v1 mem)))))
; =
; (HIDE (wr a1 new-v1 (wr a2 v2 (wr a3 v3 mem)))

; [Note: The use of this HIDE trick here is sloppily implemented in this
; example.  One should not put a HIDE on the answer term until there's reason
; to believe that the address expressions thus hidden will not change under
; further rewriting, but we don't worry about that here.]

(in-package "ACL2")

(defun wr (addr val mem)
  (let ((addr (nfix addr)))
    (cond
     ((equal addr 0) (cons val (cdr mem)))
     (t (cons (car mem) (wr (- addr 1) val (cdr mem)))))))

; (wr 5 'five '(0 I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX))
; = '(0 I II III IV FIVE VI VII VIII IX)

; Now we define our metafunction, meta-wr, which relies on this recursive
; function which eliminates the first write to address expression a found in
; the WR-term term.

(defun rem-shadowed (a term)
  (declare (xargs :guard (pseudo-termp term)))
  (cond
   ((and (consp term)
         (eq (car term) 'WR))
    (cond ((equal a (cadr term))

                   (rem-shadowed a (cadddr term))))))
   (t term)))

; So here's our metafunction, which uses case-match to look for its main
; trigger, an input term of the form (WR a v (HIDE mem)) and transforms it to
; (HIDE (WR a v mem')) where mem' has (possibly) had a shadowed write removed.
; If there is no HIDE on the mem, meta-wr puts a HIDE around the input term to
; get the process started.  On an inside-out pass through a nest of n WR calls,
; meta-wr is fired n times and propagates a HIDE to the top.

(defun meta-wr (term)
  (declare (xargs :guard (pseudo-termp term)))
  (case-match term
    (('WR a v ('HIDE mem))
     (list 'HIDE (list 'WR a v (rem-shadowed a mem))))
    (('WR & & &)
     (list 'HIDE term))
    (& term)))

;(meta-wr '(WR A1 NEW-V1 (HIDE (WR A2 V2 (WR A3 V3 (WR A1 V1 MEM))))))
; = (HIDE (WR A1 NEW-V1 (WR A2 V2 (WR A3 V3 MEM))))

; Here is the evaluator and arity-alist we will need:

(defevaluator evl evl-lst ((hide x) (wr a v mem)))
(defconst *arity-alist* '((HIDE . 1) (WR . 3)))

; Next we prove the well-formedness guarantee.  We must first prove that the
; recursive rem-shadowed preserves termp and then we can prove that meta-wr
; does too:

(defthm termp-rem-shadowed
  (implies (and ; (termp a w)  ; See Note below

                (arities-okp *arity-alist* w))
           (termp (rem-shadowed a mem) w)))

; Note: In general a well-formedness lemma or theorem about a function requires
; well-formedness hypotheses about each argument.  But in the case of
; rem-shadowed, the argument a does not appear in the answer and so it doesn't
; really matter if it is well-formed or not!

                )
           (logic-fnsp (rem-shadowed a mem) w)))

; The following lemma isn't needed (because the two above are sufficient), but
; it's still nice to prove.

; This next event is entirely irrelevant to the point of this book but is
; probably the most interesting mathematical step!  We need to prove that it is
; sound to remove a shadowed write without knowing anything about the values of
; the intervening writes.  This is the inductively proved lemma named
; shadowing-justifies-rem-shadowed below.  But to prove that lemma we need another
