; This proof of nil illustrates why ACL2 tracks dfs much as it tracks stobjs,
; so that for example a double-float isn't given as an argument to EQUAL.
; (Perhaps this issue could instead by adding a double-float datatype to ACL2
; and defining EQUAL to return nil if exactly one argument is a double-float,
; but the prover relies heavily on EQUAL being defined as true equality.  So
; then we might distinguish between ACL2::EQUAL and COMMON-LISP::EQUAL.  But
; that would probably present many opportunities for bugs and might well
; require major changes to the community books.)
