Name the formula above *1.

Perhaps we can prove *1 by induction.  Three induction schemes are
suggested by this conjecture.  These merge into two derived induction
schemes.  However, one of these is flawed and so we are left with one
viable candidate.  

We will induct according to a scheme suggested by (RUN A S), but modified
to accommodate (APPEND A B).  These suggestions were produced using
the :induction rules BINARY-APPEND and RUN.  If we let (:P A B S) denote
*1 above then the induction scheme we'll use is
(AND (IMPLIES (AND (NOT (ENDP A))
                   (:P (CDR A) B (STEP S)))
              (:P A B S))
     (IMPLIES (ENDP A) (:P A B S))).
This induction is justified by the same argument used to admit RUN.
Note, however, that the unmeasured variable S is being instantiated.
When applied to the goal at hand the above induction scheme produces
two nontautological subgoals.

Subgoal *1/2
(IMPLIES (AND (NOT (ENDP A))
              (EQUAL (RUN (APPEND (CDR A) B) (STEP S))
                     (RUN B (RUN (CDR A) (STEP S)))))
         (EQUAL (RUN (APPEND A B) S)
                (RUN B (RUN A S)))).

By the simple :definition ENDP we reduce the conjecture to

Subgoal *1/2'
(IMPLIES (AND (CONSP A)
              (EQUAL (RUN (APPEND (CDR A) B) (STEP S))
                     (RUN B (RUN (CDR A) (STEP S)))))
         (EQUAL (RUN (APPEND A B) S)
                (RUN B (RUN A S)))).

But simplification reduces this to T, using the :definitions BINARY-APPEND
and RUN, primitive type reasoning and the :rewrite rule RUN-OPENER.

Subgoal *1/1
(IMPLIES (ENDP A)
         (EQUAL (RUN (APPEND A B) S)
                (RUN B (RUN A S)))).

By the simple :definition ENDP we reduce the conjecture to

Subgoal *1/1'
(IMPLIES (NOT (CONSP A))
         (EQUAL (RUN (APPEND A B) S)
                (RUN B (RUN A S)))).

But simplification reduces this to T, using the :definitions BINARY-APPEND
and RUN and primitive type reasoning.

That completes the proof of *1.

Name the formula above *1.

Perhaps we can prove *1 by induction.  Three induction schemes are
suggested by this conjecture.  Subsumption reduces that number to one.

We will induct according to a scheme suggested by (G N A).  This suggestion
was produced using the :induction rules G and G-SCHED-LOOP.  If we
let (:P A N STK) denote *1 above then the induction scheme we'll use
is
(AND (IMPLIES (AND (NOT (ZP N))
                   (:P (* N A) (+ -1 N) STK))
              (:P A N STK))
     (IMPLIES (ZP N) (:P A N STK))).
This induction is justified by the same argument used to admit G. 
Note, however, that the unmeasured variable A is being instantiated.
When applied to the goal at hand the above induction scheme produces
four nontautological subgoals.

Name the formula above *1.

Perhaps we can prove *1 by induction.  Two induction schemes are suggested
by this conjecture.  Subsumption reduces that number to one.  

We will induct according to a scheme suggested by (G N A).  This suggestion
was produced using the :induction rules F and G.  If we let (:P A N)
denote *1 above then the induction scheme we'll use is
(AND (IMPLIES (AND (NOT (ZP N)) (:P (* N A) (+ -1 N)))
              (:P A N))
     (IMPLIES (ZP N) (:P A N))).
This induction is justified by the same argument used to admit G. 
Note, however, that the unmeasured variable A is being instantiated.
When applied to the goal at hand the above induction scheme produces
three nontautological subgoals.

Subgoal *1/3
(IMPLIES (AND (NOT (ZP N))
              (EQUAL (G (+ -1 N) (* N A))
                     (* (* N A) (F (+ -1 N))))
              (NATP A))
         (EQUAL (G N A) (* A (F N)))).

By the simple :rewrite rule ASSOCIATIVITY-OF-* we reduce the conjecture
to

Subgoal *1/3'
(IMPLIES (AND (NOT (ZP N))
              (EQUAL (G (+ -1 N) (* N A))
                     (* N A (F (+ -1 N))))
              (NATP A))
         (EQUAL (G N A) (* A (F N)))).

But simplification reduces this to T, using the :compound-recognizer
rule ACL2::ZP-COMPOUND-RECOGNIZER, the :definitions F and G, primitive
type reasoning and the :rewrite rule ACL2::COMMUTATIVITY-2-OF-*.

Subgoal *1/2
(IMPLIES (AND (NOT (ZP N))
              (NOT (NATP (* N A)))
              (NATP A))
         (EQUAL (G N A) (* A (F N)))).

But we reduce the conjecture to T, by the :compound-recognizer rules
ACL2::NATP-COMPOUND-RECOGNIZER and ACL2::ZP-COMPOUND-RECOGNIZER and
primitive type reasoning.

Subgoal *1/1
(IMPLIES (AND (ZP N) (NATP A))
         (EQUAL (G N A) (* A (F N)))).

But simplification reduces this to T, using the :compound-recognizer
rules ACL2::NATP-COMPOUND-RECOGNIZER and ACL2::ZP-COMPOUND-RECOGNIZER,
the :definitions F, FIX and G, primitive type reasoning and the :rewrite
rules COMMUTATIVITY-OF-* and UNICITY-OF-1.

That completes the proof of *1.

But simplification reduces this to T, using the :compound-recognizer
rule ACL2::NATP-COMPOUND-RECOGNIZER, the :definitions DO-INST, HALTEDP
and NEXT-INST, the :executable-counterparts of CONSP, EQUAL, NTH and
OPCODE, primitive type reasoning and the :rewrite rules MAIN, STACKS,
STATES and STEP-OPENER.

Q.E.D.

The storage of COROLLARY2 depends upon the :type-prescription rule
HALTEDP.
