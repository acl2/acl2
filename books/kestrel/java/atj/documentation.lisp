   (xdoc::h3 "Introduction")

   (xdoc::p
    "ATJ translates ACL2 to Java,
     enabling ACL2 code to be used in Java code
     (in the sense explained below).")

   (xdoc::p
    "For instance, ATJ is useful
     to generate Java code at the end of
     an <see topic='@(url apt::apt)'>APT</see> program synthesis derivation.")

   ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

   (xdoc::h3 "Scope")

   (xdoc::p
    "ATJ translates ACL2 named functions to corresponding Java code
     whose execution mimics the execution of the ACL2 functions.")

   (xdoc::p
    "The ACL2 functions accepted by ATJ may manipulate any ACL2 value:
     @(see acl2::characters),
     @(see acl2::strings),
     @(see acl2::symbols),
     @(see acl2::numbers), and
     @(see acl2::conses).
     The Java code that corresponds to the ACL2 functions
     manipulates Java representations of the ACL2 values.")

   (xdoc::p
    "ATJ accepts all the ACL2 functions that
     (1) have an @('unnormalized-body') property (see @(tsee body)) and
     (2) either do not have raw Lisp code
     or have raw Lisp code but belong to a whitelist.
     The ACL2 functions with raw Lisp code
     are the ones listed in the global variables
     @('program-fns-with-raw-code') and @('logic-fns-with-raw-code').
     The aforementioned whitelist consists of functions
     whose @('unnormalized-body') property is
     functionally equivalent to the raw Lisp code.
     The Java code that corresponds to the ACL2 functions
     that satisfy conditions (1) and (2) above,
     mimics the computations described by their @('unnormalized-body').")

   (xdoc::p
    "ATJ also accepts the ACL2 function @(tsee return-last)
     (which has raw Lisp code),
     but only when it is called on @('mbe-raw1') as the first argument.
     Calls of the form @('(return-last 'mbe1-raw ...)')
     are translated representations of calls of @(tsee mbe).
     Thus, in reference to the whitelist described in the previous paragraph,
     @(tsee return-last) is ``partially'' whitelisted.")

   (xdoc::p
    "ATJ also accepts all the @(see acl2::primitive) ACL2 functions.
     The Java code that corresponds to these ACL2 functions
     has the input/output behavior documented for these functions.")

   (xdoc::p
    "ATJ accepts both logic-mode and program-mode functions.")

   (xdoc::p
    "Some ACL2 functions have side effect when executed,
     e.g. @(tsee hard-error) prints an error message
     and returns control to the top level.
     All the ACL2 functions with side effects have raw Lisp code
     and are not in the whitelist mentioned above.
     Therefore, the generated Java code
     does not mimic any of the side effects exhibited by ACL2 functions.
     Support for translating ACL2 functions with side effects
     to Java code that mimics those side effects
     may be added in the future.")

   (xdoc::p
    "ATJ does not accept functions that access @(see acl2::stobj)s.
     Support for stobjs, and destructive updates of stobjs,
     may be added in the future.")

   (xdoc::p
    "ATJ does not translate
     <see topic='@(url defmacro)'>macro definitions</see> to Java code.
     However, the use of macros in function bodies is fully supported,
     because ATJ operates on ACL2 translated terms,
     where macros are expanded.")

   (xdoc::p
    "ATJ does not translate
     <see topic='@(url defconst)'>constant definitions</see> to Java code.
     However, the use of named constants in function bodies is fully supported,
     because ATJ operates on ACL2 translated terms,
     where constants are expanded.")

   (xdoc::p
    "The Java counterparts of the translated ACL2 functions
     mimic execution ``in the logic'',
     without <see topic='@(url acl2::guard-checking)'>checking guards</see>.
     In particular,
     only the @(':logic') part of calls of @(tsee mbe) is executed:
     the @(':exec') part is completely ignored.
     Support for guards and more efficient execution
     (including the execution of the @(':exec') part of calls of @(tsee mbe))
     may be added in the future.")

   (xdoc::p
    "The generated Java code can be called by external Java code,
     but not vice versa.
     The ability to have the generated Java code call external Java code
     may be added in the future;
     this may involve the use of ACL2 stubs corresponding to
     the Java code to be invoked by the (Java-translated) ACL2 code.")

   (xdoc::p
    "External Java code can call the generated Java code
     on (Java representations of) explicit ACL2 values.
     Access to global variables
     like @(tsee state) or user-defined @(see acl2::stobj)s
     is therefore not supported;
     in particular, the generated Java code has no access to
     the ACL2/Lisp environment.
     Support for global variables, in particular @(tsee state),
     may be added in the future.")

   ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

   (xdoc::h3 "Approach")

   (xdoc::p
    "ATJ is supported by <see topic='@(url aij)'>AIJ</see>,
     which is a deep embedding in Java
     of the executable subset of ACL2
     (subject to the limitations outlined above).")

   (xdoc::p
    "ATJ translates the target ACL2 functions
     into deeply embedded Java representations,
     based on their @('unnormalized-body') properties.
     It does so recursively,
     starting from the top-level functions specified by the user
     and stopping at the primitive functions,
     which have no @('unnormalized-body') property.
     If a function is encountered that
     is not among the implemented primitives
     and has no @('unnormalized-body') property,
     ATJ stops with an error.
     If a function is encountered that has raw Lisp code
     and is not in the whitelist,
     ATJ stops with an error.")

   (xdoc::p
    "ATJ generates a Java file
     with a public class with two public methods,
     in a user-defined Java package (distinct from AIJ's package).
     One public method builds
     (1) the deeply embedded ACL2 functions,
     making them available for execution via interpretation, and
     (2) a representation of
     some other portions of the ACL2 environment needed for execution,
     such as the ACL2 packages with their import lists.
     The other public method serves
     to call deeply embedded ACL2 functions on ACL2 values.
     AIJ's Java package provides public classes and methods
     to translate certain Java values to ACL2 values and vice versa.
     Thus, by loading into the Java Virtual Machine
     the AIJ's package
     and the generated Java code,
     external Java code can ``use'' ACL2 code.")

   (xdoc::p
    "The first public method described above
     (the one that builds the ACL2 environment)
     must be called
     before calling the second public method described above
     (the one that evaluates ACL2 function calls),
     and also before calling any of AIJ's public methods
     to translate between Java and ACL2 values.")

   (xdoc::p
    "This translation approach is simple and thus fairly high-assurance.
     On the other hand, the Java code is not efficient or idiomatic.
     However, the approach may work well for some simple applications,
     and provides a good starting point for optimization.
     In the future, we may translate ACL2 functions to
     shallowly embedded Java representations,
     avoiding interpretation altogether.")
