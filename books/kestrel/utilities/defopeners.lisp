(in-package "ACL2")

;; This book contains a utility for making opener rules for recursive
;; functions.  Using such rules can be faster and more predictable than relying
;; on ACL2's heuristics to decide whether to open calls to recursive functions.
;; (Opener rules are also used by the Axe tool, which lacks such heuristics, for
;; which they help to avoid rewrite loops.)  Essentially, one opener rule is
;; produced for each top-level IF branch in the function (where an IF branch
;; can be considered top-level even if there are lambdas around it).

;; Unlike the tool in books/misc/defopener, this one doesn't do any
;; simplification.

;; Terminology: The "opener" rules for a function include the "unroll" rules
;; and the "base case" rules.

;; TODO: handle ignored let-bound params

;; TODO: ACL2 must do something like this when generating the induction scheme for a function

;; TODO: Add redundancy checking.

;; TODO: Perhaps have this traffic in untranslated terms, to produce nicer
;; theorems (but that might be hard in general).

;; TODO: give an error if there are not base rules and unroll rules (something
;; went wrong trying to analyze the body)

;; TODO: Verify guards
