(in-package "ACL2")

;; STATUS: IN-PROGRESS

;; A tool to get the event (defun or mutual-recursion or defuns) corresponding
;; to a given name, in untranslated form.  This works better than the built-in
;; utility get-event (e.g., on built-in functions introduced in :program mode
;; and later lifted to :logic mode), such as all-vars1.

;; TODO: If a function was introduced in :program mode and later lifted to
;; :logic mode, the result of my-get-event may contain :mode :program in the
;; xargs.  We could consider removing this.

;; TODO: We could consider changing DEFUNS to MUTUAL-RECURSION in the result,
;; but functions defined with DEFUNS seem rare.

(include-book "std/util/bstar" :dir :system) ;could drop even this

;; Similar to get-event-tuple in books/std/util/defredundant.lisp but without
;; some cruft that brings in dependencies.
