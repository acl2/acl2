   that is, they retain the suppression status they had before.
   If this argument is non-@('nil'), errors are suppressed;
   @('make-event-terse') will fail silently in case of an error,
   so errors should not be suppressed in normal circumstances.

   We save, via @(':stack :push'), the current status of the outputs,
   so that, inside the form passed to @('make-event-terse'),
