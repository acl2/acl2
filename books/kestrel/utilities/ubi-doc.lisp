  :long "<p>The following example explains how @(':ubi') works.  We start up
 ACL2 and submit the following @(see command)s.</p>

 @({

 (defun f (x) x)
 (include-book \"arithmetic/top\" :dir :system)
 (defun g (x) x)
 })

 <p>We can use @(':')@(tsee pbt) to see where we are:</p>

 @({
 ACL2 !>:pbt 0
            0  (EXIT-BOOT-STRAP-MODE)
    d       1  (INCLUDE-BOOK \"kestrel/utilities/ubi\"
                             :DIR ...)
    d       2  (LOCAL (INCLUDE-BOOK \"kestrel/utilities/system/world-queries\"
                                    :DIR ...))
            3  (DEFPKG \"FOO\" NIL)
    d       4  (INCLUDE-BOOK \"kestrel/std/system/defun-sk-queries\"
                             :DIR ...)
  L         5  (DEFUN F (X) ...)
    d       6  (INCLUDE-BOOK \"arithmetic/top\" :DIR ...)
  L         7:x(DEFUN G (X) ...)
 ACL2 !>
 })

 <p>The @(':ubi') command, which could be viewed as abbreviating ``Undo Back to
 Includes'' or``Undo Back to Initial commands that we want to keep,'' undoes
 commands to keep the longest initial segment of commands in the list
 @('*keeper-cmds*'), including @(tsee include-book), @(tsee defpkg), @(tsee
 add-include-book-dir), and others; commands to be kept may be wrapped in calls
 of @(tsee local) or @(tsee with-output).  These initial commands typically set
 things up for the rest of the @(see events) in a given book.  They often
 include the commands from any @(tsee acl2-customization) files, followed by
 the @(tsee include-book) events at the start of the book. The @(':ubi')
 command can thus be used to quickly clear out anything introduced in the book,
 while keeping the initial @(tsee include-book)s, which may be slow to replay.</p>

 <p>So to continue the example above:</p>

 @({
 ACL2 !>:ubi
    d       4:x(INCLUDE-BOOK \"kestrel/std/system/defun-sk-queries\"
                             :DIR ...)
 ACL2 !>:pbt 0
            0  (EXIT-BOOT-STRAP-MODE)
    d       1  (INCLUDE-BOOK \"kestrel/utilities/ubi\"
                             :DIR ...)
    d       2  (LOCAL (INCLUDE-BOOK \"kestrel/utilities/system/world-queries\"
                                    :DIR ...))
            3  (DEFPKG \"FOO\" NIL)
    d       4:x(INCLUDE-BOOK \"kestrel/std/system/defun-sk-queries\"
                             :DIR ...)
 ACL2 !>
 })

 <p>Note that when successful, @(':ubi') generates a call of @(tsee ubu), which
 in turn prints out the most recent remaining command (in this case, command
 number 4).  But @(':ubi') can fail if there is no undoing to do: we can extend
 the log above by trying to run @(':ubi') again.</p>

 @({
 ACL2 !>:ubi

 There is nothing to undo, since all commands after the boot-strap are
 DEFUN, DEFPKG, INCLUDE-BOOK, XDOC, ADD-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR or
 ADD-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR! commands.
 ACL2 !>
 })

 <p>Note that @(':ubi') only looks at commands after the latest command that is
 a call of @(tsee reset-prehistory), if any.  Continuing the example above,
 where the final command is number 4 as shown above, let us execute these
 commands.</p>

 @({
 (defun f (x) x)
 (reset-prehistory)
 (include-book \"arithmetic/top\" :dir :system)
 (defun g (x) x)
 })

 <p>Here is a subsequent log.  Notice that @(':ubi') only considers what is
 after the call of @(tsee reset-prehistory).  Thus, the initial segment that we
 keep concludes with the @('include-book') that is command number 1, because
 @(tsee defun) of @('f') preceding that command is irrelevant (since that
 @('defun') precedes the @('reset-prehistory') call).</p>

 @({
 ACL2 !>:pbt 0
            0  (RESET-PREHISTORY)
    d       1  (INCLUDE-BOOK \"arithmetic/top\" :DIR ...)
  L         2:x(DEFUN G (X) ...)
 ACL2 !>:ubi
    d       1:x(INCLUDE-BOOK \"arithmetic/top\" :DIR ...)
 ACL2 !>
 })

 <p>Finally, note that @('ubi') can be given any number of symbol arguments.
 These are added to @('*keeper-commands*') as those whose calls may appear in
 the initial segment of post-boot-strap commands that remain after undoing.
 Consider for example this @(see world):</p>

 @({
 ACL2 !>:pbt 0
            0  (EXIT-BOOT-STRAP-MODE)
    d       1  (INCLUDE-BOOK \"kestrel/utilities/ubi\"
                             :DIR ...)
    d       2  (LOCAL (INCLUDE-BOOK \"kestrel/utilities/system/world-queries\"
                                    :DIR ...))
            3  (DEFPKG \"FOO\" NIL)
    d       4  (INCLUDE-BOOK \"kestrel/std/system/defun-sk-queries\"
                             :DIR ...)
  L         5  (DEFUN F (X) ...)
    d       6  (INCLUDE-BOOK \"arithmetic/top\" :DIR ...)
  L         7:x(DEFUN G (X) ...)
 ACL2 !>
 })

 <p>Our first example above showed that submitting @(':ubi') leaves us with
 four commands after the boot-strap world.  Note that submitting @(':ubi') is
 equivalent to submitting @('(ubi)'); see @(see keyword-commands).  Suppose
 that instead, we submit the command @('(ubt defun)').  Then commands that are
 @('defun') calls are allowed to remain in the resulting world.  In this
 example, every command is either a call of @('defun') or a call of one of the
 default commands in @('*keeper-commands*'), so @('(ubi defun)') has no effect.
 If we then execute some other sort of command, say a call of @(tsee defmacro),
 then @('(ubi defun)') will undo it, leaving us with the seven commands
 displayed above.  Of course, @('(ubi defun defmacro)') would not undo the
 @('defmacro') call.</p>")
