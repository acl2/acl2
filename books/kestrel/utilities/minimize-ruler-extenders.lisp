 which we call MIN_NEW below, admits a proposed @(tsee defun) or @(tsee defund)
 form by declaring a minimal set of @(see ruler-extenders).  This MIN_NEW
 utility uses proof to eliminate ruler-extenders as completely as possible,
 while still permitting the termination proof to succeed.  The second utility,
 which we call MIN_OLD below, is applied to a function symbol that already has
 a recursive (but not mutually recursive) definition.  Here are examples that
 illustrate each of these two respective utilities.</p>

 @({
 ; MIN_NEW (to admit a proposed definition):
 (minimize-ruler-extenders
  (defun foo (x)
    (car (if (endp x)
             x
           (cons (foo (cdr x))
                 (evens (if (consp (cdr x))

                          nil)))))))

 ; MIN_OLD (to compute minimal ruler-extenders for an existing definition):
 (defun bar (x)
   (declare (xargs :ruler-extenders :all))
   (mod (if (consp x)
            (* (bar (car x))
               (if (consp (cdr x))
                   (ifix (cadr x))

          3)
        23))
 (minimize-ruler-extenders bar) ; returns (MOD)
 })

 <p>In the first (MIN_NEW) example above, a minimal set of @(see
 ruler-extenders) &mdash; in fact, THE minimal set &mdash; is the set
 @('{car}').  So the definition that is actually submitted, successfully, to
 ACL2 is obtained by making that explicit:</p>

 @({
 ACL2 !>:pe foo
  L         2:x(MINIMIZE-RULER-EXTENDERS (DEFUN FOO # ...))
               \\
 >L             (DEFUN FOO (X)
                       (DECLARE (XARGS :RULER-EXTENDERS (CAR)))
                       (CAR (IF (ENDP X)
                                X
                                (CONS (FOO (CDR X))
                                      (EVENS (IF (CONSP (CDR X))
                                                 (FOO (CDDR X))
                                                 NIL))))))
 ACL2 !>
 })

 <p>The input form for the MIN_NEW utility should be a call of @(tsee defun) or
 @(tsee defund) that defines a function symbol that is not already defined.  If
 that form specifies @(':ruler-extenders lst'), then ACL2 will look for a
 minimal subsequence of @('lst') that can serve as the ruler-extenders.
 Otherwise, ACL2 will start by additing an @(tsee xargs) declaration,
 @(':ruler-extenders lst'), where @('lst') contains every plausible
 ruler-extender, and then will try to find a minimal subsequence of
 @('lst').</p>

 <p>Now we turn to the MIN_OLD utility.  This utility is applied to a function
 symbol @('F') that already has a (singly) recursive definition.  It returns a
 subset of the ruler-extenders @('R') of @('F') that is minimal in the
 following sense: it provides the same induction-machine as @('R').  (The
 ``induction-machine'' is an ACL2 data structure representing the scheme used
 when doing induction based on the recursion in @('F').)</p>")
