;This book contains a model of the JVM heap.

;FIXME think hard about this new heap model to make sure it's faithful to the semantics of the JVM
;changes from the M5 heap model (references are not wrapped in a call of 'ref; now they are just integers)
;the heap is now a map, which admits nice g/s reasoning
;the new-ad functions (and related functions are guaranteed to return fresh addresses, without needing a heap invariant)
