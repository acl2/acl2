(in-package "X")

;; Two approaches: 1. Use X86 as the only variable and get back a term
;; over the single variable X86 that captures the effect of the code.
;; 2. Introduce variables such as X and Y for the inputs and get back
;; a term over x86 and those variables.  This may make it easier to
;; state assumptions (since they can mention X and Y).  We use the
;; second approach here for now.

;; TODO: Add option to prune the DAG

;; TODO: Add support for a fixed or limited number of steps, for debugging
