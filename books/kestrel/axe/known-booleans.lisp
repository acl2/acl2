;; A table for tracking functions that are known to be booleans. This allows
;; for stronger reasoning, e.g., replacing boolean terms with T when they are
;; in a set of assumptions that are known (to be non-nil).  Similar reasoning
;; is used when making Axe rules; if the conclusion is a known boolean, Axe
;; makes a rule that rewrites it to T.

;; Note that the soundness of Axe depends on this table being correct.  So we
;; check that a function does in fact always return a boolean before adding it
;; to the table.

;; TODO: Can we somehow protect the table from a user modifying it?
