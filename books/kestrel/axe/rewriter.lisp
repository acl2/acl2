;; NOTE: Instead of this rewriter, consider using rewriter-basic or
;; rewriter-jvm or another custom rewriter if possible.  Unlike this one, they
;; do not depend on any skip-proofs.

;; NOTE: This currentlty depends on the JVM model, for the axe-syntaxp and
;; axe-bind-free functions.

;; TODO: Consider adding support for normalizing bvxor and bitxor nests during
;; the rewriting process, like rewriter-alt has for bvxor nests.

;; Axe contains a sophisticated rewriter capable of efficiently transforming
;; large terms by repeatedly applying local ``rewrite rules.''  The rewrite
;; rules used are equivalence-preserving.  That is, they allow a term to be
;; replaced only by another term which always returns the same value.  Because
;; Axe terms are side-effect-free, rewriting can be performed without changing
;; the meaning of any over-arching term.

;; A major goal of rewriting is to simplify the terms involved. Simplification
;; is almost always desirable; it helps keep terms small and is sufficient to
;; completely prove some claims (because they simplify down to ``true'').  A
;; related goal is to normalize terms.  Normalization is the process of
;; transforming syntactically different but semantically equivalent terms so
;; that they have the same syntactic representation (and so are clearly equal
;; by inspection).  Efficient rewriting schemes may not exist to completely
;; normalize the terms with which Axe deals.  Nevertheless, normalization works
;; fairly well in practice, using the techniques and the rewrite rules
;; described here.

;; Rewriting can also be used to simply change the form of terms, for example,
;; to bit-blast them (to split multi-bit operations into single-bit
;; operations), or to eliminate certain operators (such as the
;; \texttt{leftrotate} operator, which cannot always be directly translated
;; into the language of STP).  Finally, rewriting can be used to strengthen a
;; set of known facts, using information provided by some new fact.

;; The Axe Rewriter is similar to the rewriter of the ACL2 theorem prover and
;; borrows many important ideas from it.  However, the Axe Rewriter has several
;; advantages.  The most significant is its efficient representation of terms
;; as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).  In the DAG representation, each distinct
;; subterm is represented only once.  Nodes in the DAG represent expressions
;; and are numbered sequentially from 0.  The allowed expression types are
;; constants, variables, and functions applied to lists of arguments, each of
;; which is a constant or the number of another node.  The DAG is acyclic
;; because a function call node's arguments must be nodes with smaller numbers.

;; The Axe Rewriter also performs memoization, uses ``objectives'' to guide
;; rewriting, efficiently handles large XOR nests, provides more fine-grained
;; control of rule ordering, and provides a facility for calling the Axe Prover
;; (a separate but related tool) to discharge hypotheses of conditional rewrite
;; rules.

;; The Axe Rewriter is very fast, performing, in one example, about 600,000
;; rewrite rule attempts per second.

;; The Axe Rewriter is designed to be used as a stand-alone component, in
;; contrast to the ACL2 rewriter, which is interwoven with the rest of ACL2's
;; proof process.  The Axe Rewriter is designed to be trusted but is not proved
;; correct with ACL2 (although that could be attempted some day).

;; An alternative to using a rewriter in a verification system is to simply
;; encode all the desired transformations by hand; one would simply write a
;; program that transforms terms (DAGs) in whatever way is desired. However,
;; this is likely to be complicated and error prone.  Adding a new
;; transformation would require writing more code, and programming bugs could
;; compromise the correctness of the system.  Axe's approach is to factor the
;; problem into two parts, a general-purpose rewriter and a set of rewrite
;; rules (theorems) used to ``program'' the rewriter.  This approach has
;; several advantages.  First, it allows a large number of different
;; transformations to be added to the system; Axe contains hundreds of rewrite
;; rules, and it would be tedious to write code for all of them.  Second, Axe's
;; approach makes it easy to experiment with different sets of transformations;
;; one simply passes different sets of rewrite rules to the Axe Rewriter.
;; Similarly, one can easily change the order in which transformations are
;; applied, using Axe's system of rule ``priorities''.  Finally, adding new
;; transformations can be done in a sound way because the transformations can
;; be proved as theorems in the ACL2 logic.  This ensures that adding a new
;; rule won't render the system unsound.  When new rules are added, the amount
;; of the code that must be trusted (the code of the Axe Rewriter itself) stays
;; the same.

;; The Axe Rewriter lacks several features of the ACL2 rewriter, including
;; ``forward-chaining'' rules, a procedure to determine the types of terms, and
;; a built-in linear arithmetic procedure.  None of these features were
;; necessary for the examples discussed here.
