     via the flag theorem macro of the encoding functions,
     an examining the induction scheme printed by ACL2,
     should make the problem apparent.")

    "The induction proof makes use of two helper lemmas.")
   (xdoc::p
    "The first helper lemma applies to the two cases in which
     @('x') is a leaf tree and @('y') is a leaf tree.
     Commenting out this helper lemma from the hints of the induction theorem
     shows the two corresponding subgoals,
     in which the hypothesis that @('x') or @('y') is a leaf tree
     causes @(tsee rlp-encode-tree) to expand on @('x') or @('y'),
     generating a call to @(tsee rlp-encode-bytes) on the subtrees.
     This motivates the formulation of the first helper lemma,
     whose variable @('xy') stands for @('x') or @('y')
     and whose variable @('yx') stands for @('y') or @('x'),
     i.e. the other variable whose @(tsee rlp-encode-tree) in the subgoal
     is not expanded.
     We use an expansion hint to expand that; an enable hint does not suffice.
     If @('yx') is also a leaf tree,
     @(tsee rlp-encode-tree) reduces to @(tsee rlp-encode-bytes) on the subtrees
     and the injectivity theorem of @(tsee rlp-encode-bytes) applies.
     Otherwise, the expansion starts with a byte that is at least 192 or 247,
     which is incompatible with
     the starting byte of @(tsee rlp-encode-bytes) on (the subtrees of) @('xy'):
     the linear rule @('car-of-rlp-encode-bytes-upper-bound-when-no-error')
     does not apply here,
     so we use a @(':use') hint with a suitable instantiation.")
   (xdoc::p
    "The second helper lemma applies to the case in which
     the lists of trees @('xs') and @('ys') are not empty.
     In this case, their encodings are the @(tsee append)s
     of the encodings of their @(tsee car)s and of their @(tsee cdr)s.
     Commenting out this helper lemma from the hints of the induction theorem
     shows a subgoal that involves these @(tsee append)s.
     To use the induction hypotheses,
     we need to decompose the equality of the @(tsee append)s
     into the equalities of their @(tsee car) and @(tsee cdr) encodings,
     via the rule @('equal-of-appends-decompose')
     that we also used to prove the injectivity of @(tsee rlp-encode-bytes).
     For this, we need to relieve the hypothesis of that rule
     that the lenghts of the encodings of the @(tsee car)s are equal:
     this is done by the lemma @('car-encodings-same-len').")
   (xdoc::p
    "The key to proving @('car-encodings-same-len')
     is the fact that the lengths of the encodings of the @(tsee car)s
     are completely determined by the first (few) bytes of the encodings,
     as expressed by the rule @('len-of-rlp-encode-tree-from-prefix'),
     which we therefore enable to prove @('car-encodings-same-len').
     This rule rewrites the two lengths to prove equal
     in terms of the first (few) bytes of the encodings
     of the @(tsee car)s of @('xs') and @('ys'):
     if we knew that those encodings were equal, we would be done.
     But we only know (see hypothesis in @('car-encodings-same-len'))
     that the @(tsee append)s of the encodings of the @(tsee car)s
     with something else (the encodings of the @(tsee cdr)s) are equal.
     Fortunately, the first (few) bytes of the encodings of the @(tsee car)s
     are also the first (few) bytes of the @(tsee append)s.
     So we use the rules
     @('expand-to-car-of-append') and @('expand-to-take-of-append')
     to express the first (few) bytes that describe the lengths
     in terms of the @(tsee append)s;
     note that these two rules have a strictly more complex right hand side,
     so they are generally undesirable,
     yet they are useful in this proof.
     We disable the rules
     @('acl2::car-of-append') and @('acl2::take-of-append'),
     which work ``against''
     @('expand-to-car-of-append') and @('expand-to-take-of-append'),
     to prevent the rewriter from looping.")

     along with the rule @('true-listp-when-byte-listp-rewrite'),

     (visible by commenting out this rule in the hints),
     similar to the one proved via the second helper lemma,
     but simpler due to an extra hypothesis @('(equal (cdr xs) (cdr ys))').")
