  :long
  "<p>
   These values provide information about the reason why
   an RLP encoding is erroneous and cannot be parsed or decoded.
   </p>
   <p>
   The @(':no-bytes') error occurs
   when starting to parse or decode a (sub)tree but no bytes are available.
   </p>
   <p>
   The @(':fewer-bytes-than-...') errors occur when,
   after successfully reading a length,
   there are fewer bytes available than the required length.
   The length may be a short length (i.e. below 56, part of the first byte),
   the length of a long length (i.e. between 1 and 8, part of the first byte),
   or a long length (i.e. a big endian length).
   In these errors, the @('fragment') field consists of the first byte,
   possibly followed by the big endian length bytes as applicable.
   </p>
   <p>
   The @(':leading-zeros-in-long-length') errors occurs when
   a long length has leading zeros.
   See the discussion in @(tsee rlp-parse-tree).
   The @('fragment') field consists of the first byte
   followed by the big endian length.
   </p>
   <p>
   The @(':non-optimal-...') errors occur when
   the encoding is longer than it must be.
   See the discussion in @(tsee rlp-parse-tree).
   The @('fragment') field consists of the first byte,
   possibly followed by the big endian length bytes as applicable.
   </p>
   <p>
   Since parsing and decoding are recursive,
   errors from subtree encodings must be propagated upward,
   because the supertree encodings are therefore erroneous.
   The @(':error-in-subtree') errors propagate and wrap
   the error from a subtree.
   Note that this makes the definition of this fixtype of errors recursive.
   </p>
   <p>
   The @(':extra-bytes') errors occur only in decoding, not in parsing.
   Parsing always returns any remaining bytes as a result,
   while decoding requires the input bytes to have the right length.
   The @('bytes') field of these errors consists of the extra bytes.
   </p>
   <p>
   The @(':non-leaf-tree') errors occur
   when attempting to decode a byte array (i.e. a leaf tree)
   results in a non-leaf tree instead.
   The @('fragment') field contains the starting byte of the encoding.
   </p>
   <p>
   The @(':leading-zeros-in-scalar') errors occur
   when attempting to decode a scalar results in
   a byte array with leading zeros.

   (xdoc::p
    "This parser is fairly straightforward,
     but there is a slight subtlety missed by some implementations,
     including the reference decoding code in [Wiki:RLP]:
     in order to recognize only valid encodings
     (as formalized by @(tsee rlp-tree-encoding-p)),
     a decoder must reject encodings that use ``non-optimal'' lengths.
     For instance, the singleton byte array @('(10)')
     must be encoded as itself (@(tsee rlp-encode-bytes)),
     and not as @('(129 10)').
     Note that @(tsee rlp-bytes-encoding-p) does not hold on @('(129 10)'),
     because that sequence of bytes
     is not in the image of @(tsee rlp-encode-bytes).
     (This example talks about encoded byte arrays,
     but leaf trees are encoded in the same way.)")
   (xdoc::p
    "So our decoding code checks that
     (i) the form @('(129 x)') is not used with @('x') below 128,
     (ii) a big endian length has no leading zeros, and
     (iii) a big endian length is not below 56.
     Cases (ii) and (iii) apply to both leaf and non-leaf trees,
     while case (i) applies to leaf trees only.
     Without these extra checks, the decoder would accept
     not only all the valid encodings,
     but also some invalid encodings with non-optimal lengths.")
   (xdoc::p
    "Neither [YP:B] nor [Wiki:RLP] explicitly talk about this,
     but the fact that [YP:B] prescribes the encodings in all cases
     can be reasonably taken to exclude the encodings with non-optimal lengths.
     Furthermore, various GitHub issues for Ethereum implementations
     regard the acceptance of encodings with non-optimal lengths as bugs.
     Thus, we take the strict interpretation
     and regard such encodings as invalid.
     (Otherwise, formally, encoding would have to be a relation
     instead of a function.)")
   (xdoc::p
    "The function to parse single trees is mutually recursive with
     a function to parse lists of trees.
     The latter does not return the remaining bytes:
     it is always called with the exact byte sequence
     that is supposed to encode the trees of the list,
     one tree after the other.")
   (xdoc::p
    "The termination of these parsing function is proved
     via a lexicographic measure.
     The first component is the length of the input;
     the second component is an ordering on the two parsing functions
     where the one for trees is smaller than the one for lists of trees.
     This second component is needed because
     the function for lists of trees calls the one for trees
     on the same input (to parse the first tree in the list),
     and so the ordering on the function makes the overall measure smaller.
     When the function for trees calls the one for lists of trees,
     the input has been reduced in length by at least the first byte,
     and so it is immediate to prove that the overall measure decreases.
     When the function for lists of trees calls itself recursively,
     the input has also decreased,
     but this is a property of the function for trees,
     which cannot be proved until the function is admitted,
     i.e. shown to terminate.
     In other words, the termination here depends on functional properties.
     Thus, we use @(tsee mbt) to ensure that the length has in fact decreased,
     which lets us prove termination.
     Then guard verification ensures that that check is always satisfied.
     Under the negated @(tsee mbt) condition, we must return some error,
     but it does not matter which error, since this case never happens.")
   (xdoc::p
    "Before verifying guards,
     we need to show that @(tsee rlp-parse-tree)
     returns fewer remaining bytes than the input bytes when there is no error.
     This is done by the linear rules.")
   (xdoc::p
    "If a sequence of bytes is successfully parsed,
     a sequence obtained by adding extra bytes at the end
     is also successfully parsed.
     The decoded tree is the same.
     The remaining bytes are extended with the extra bytes.
     This is all expressed by the theorem @('rlp-parse-tree-extend').
     This theorem plays a role in the left inverse proof below.")
   (xdoc::p
    "@(tsee rlp-parse-tree) is left inverse of @(tsee rlp-encode-tree),
     over the encodable trees.
     This implies that @(tsee rlp-parse-tree) accepts
     all valid encodings of trees.
     This is expressed by the theorem @('rlp-parse-tree-of-rlp-encode-tree'),
     which says that if @(tsee rlp-encode-tree) is successful,
     then parsing is successful,
     with no remaining bytes,
     and returns the starting bytes (modulo fixing).
     The proof is by induction on the encoding functions.
     It is not particularly difficult.
     It needs some @(':expand') hints
     for calls that ACL2's heuristics do not expand;
     note that there is an @(':expand') hint
     for each possible range of the first byte of the encoding,
     except for the range below 128.
     It also needs two instances of a theorem that relates
     the length of the big endian lengths to the lengths themselves;
     note that there are two instances,
     one for leaf trees (i.e. byte arrays encoded with long lengths)
     and one for non-leaf trees (i.e. subtrees encoded with long lengths).")
   (xdoc::p
    "@(tsee rlp-parse-tree) is right inverse of @(tsee rlp-encode-tree),
     over the valid byte array encodings.
     This implies that @(tsee rlp-parse-tree) accepts
     only valid encodings of tree:
     if it accepted an invalid encoding,
     this right inverse theorem would imply that
     @(tsee rlp-encode-tree) would map the result
     back to that invalid encoding,
     which would therefore be a valid encoding,
     contradicting the initial assumption.
     This right inverse theorem is @('rlp-encode-tree-of-rlp-parse-tree'),
     which says that if decoding is successful,
     then encoding is successful
     and the resulting encoding,
     concatenated with the reamining bytes from the decoding,
     is the initial input of the encoding (modulo fixing).
     The proof is by induction on the parsing functions.
     It is not particularly difficult.
     Similarly to the proof for left inverse,
     it uses two instances of the theorem that relates
     the length of the big endian lengths to the lengths themselves;
     the two instances correspond to leaf and non-leaf trees
     encoded with long lengths.")
