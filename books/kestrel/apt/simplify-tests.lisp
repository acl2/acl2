; This book provides a few very simple tests of simplify.  Many more tests
; may be found in simplify-defun-tests.lisp and simplify-defun-sk-tests.lisp,
; which also test simplify, since calls of simplify-defun and
; simplify-defun-sk expand immediately into calls of simplify.  In fact,
; these "few very simple tests" are lifted from those two books.

; Here we check that simplification is considered to have effect in the
; following case: the original function is recursive, simplification of the
; translated body produced a change, and there the untranslated source and
; final functions are identical except for the name change.  Since the
; comparison is on untranslated bodies, we can't use sublis-fn or its variants,
; so we use sublis instead.  Note that soundness is not an issue since we do
; all necessary proofs, and heuristically this should do what we want in
; virtually all cases.  It even does what we want in the case of defun-nx,
; where the untranslated body is of the form (PROG2$ (THROW-NONEXEC-ERROR 'fn
; ...) ...) where fn is the function being defined.
