; - Deal with FIXMEs below.

; NOTE: An interesting difference between the implementations of simplify-defun
; and simplify-defun-sk is that the former goes out of its way to incorporate
; the acl2::congruence-theory into the set of runes created, while
; simplify-defun-sk does not.  Why is that?  One reason, and perhaps the only
; one, is that the before-vs-after lemmas supporting a call of simplify-defun
; use the generated equivalence relation at a subterm specified by
; :simplify-body.  This is unnecessary for simplify-defun-sk or simplify-term,
; because a single equality (or equivalence) lemma is generated for the entire
; body or term, respectively.  Thus, simplify-defun is optimized in the sense
; that rewriting is restricted to the relevant subterms; calls outside the
; subterms are not rewritten.  This difference could be rationalized (perhaps
; eliminated) in the future if the need arises, either by simplifying the
; implementation of simplify-defun to make it agree with the implementations of
; simplify-defun-sk and simplify-term, or instead, applying the finer-grained
; simplification performed by simplify-defun to the implementations of
; simplify-defun-sk and simplify-term.

; FIXME: We should deal properly with this case.  Here is a comment from
; Alessandro.

;   I think that simplify-defthm would be useful in general. You re right that
;   the effect of a custom rewrite rule is similar to proving a theorem after
;   the defun-sk, but the difference is that the theorem is not "linked" to the
;   function as the :thm-name is - in particular, the quantfun utilities will
;   retrieve TEMP in that case. We could work around this issue via a
;   user-defined table that associates to defun-sk's generated by
;   transformations, their rewrite rule, and have our transformations handle
;   these appropriately. But it would be probably cleaner, if possible, to
;   generate the right rewrite rule as part of the generated defun-sk.

; Probably this should be an error so that the user can be directed to specify
; a value for :rewrite in the call of simplify-defun-sk.  But for now I won't
; rock the boat.
