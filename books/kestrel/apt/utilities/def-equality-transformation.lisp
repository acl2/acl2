;; This book includes a tool to help define an equality-preserving
;; transformation.  You provide the core function that transforms a function
;; body, and the tool builds all the boilerplate machinery for you.  The tool
;; calls deftransformation to build some of the boilerplate but is more
;; specific than deftransformation.  Specifically, the new and old versions of
;; each function should be equal (no wrapper, no reordering/dropping/adding of
;; params, etc.).

;; See def-equality-transformation-tests.lisp for an example of what it generates.
