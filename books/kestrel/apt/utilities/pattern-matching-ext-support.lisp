(defun ext-rename-for-substitution (formals actuals subterm body)

; This function returns a tuple (mv formals1 subterm1 body1) with properties
; explained below.

; The motivation is to substitute subterm at some address of body, but without
; capturing variables of subterm by the bindings of formals to actuals.  In
; essence we simply alpha-convert ((lambda formals body) . actuals) to ((lambda
; formals1 body1) . actuals) so that we can perform that substitution without
; capture.  However, we try to optimize by avoiding needless renaming: we map
; actuals to formals in the process of producing body1.

; Before giving a formal specification of this function, let us see how it
; works on an example.  We want to substitute the new subterm (h (f2 u v)) at
; the position of (g v) in the following term, where we view the variables of h
; as being "global", not bound by the LET:

;   (let ((u (f1 u v))
;         (v (f2 u v)))
;     (f3 u (g v)))

; Here is the translation of that term.

;   ((LAMBDA (U V) (F3 U (G V)))
;    (F1 U V)
;    (F2 U V))

; If we naively move (h (f2 u v)) inside the bindings, there is variable
; capture.  However, notice that (f2 u v) is the value of v in the bindings.
; So it is legal to substitute (h v) inside the bindings, and we should wind up
; with:

;   (let ((u (f1 u v))
;         (v (f2 u v)))
;     (f3 u (h v)))

; That is, we should get the following result.

;   (let ((formals '(u v))
;         (actuals '((f1 u v) (f2 u v)))
;         (subterm '(h (f2 u v)))
;         (body '(f3 u (g v))))
;     (ext-rename-for-substitution formals actuals subterm body))
;   = {return new (formals subterm body)
;   ((U V) (H V) (F3 U (G V)))

; On the other hand, if we aren't fortunate enough to be able to substitute
; legally inside the bindings, then we rename formals.  Here is an example:

;   (let ((formals '(u v))
;         (actuals '((f1 u v) (f2 u v)))
;         (subterm '(h u))
;         (body '(f3 u (g v))))
;     (ext-rename-for-substitution formals actuals subterm body))
;   = {return new (formals subterm body)
;   ((U{1} V) (H U) (F3 U{1} (G V)))

; Let's look at how the first of these two examples is carried out by our
; algorithm. For readability we write untranslated terms below even though we
; actually operate on translated terms.

;;;;; Start example

; The problem is to substitute (h (f2 u v)) at the position of (g v) here:

;   (let ((u (f1 u v))
;         (v (f2 u v)))
;     (f3 u (g v)))

; First alpha-convert the original term to avoid capture upon substituting (h
; (f2 u v)):

;   (let ((u1 (f1 u v))
;         (v1 (f2 u v)))
;     (f3 u1 (g v1)))

; Apply the bindings in reverse to (h (f2 u v)), to obtain (h v1).

; Now substitute (h v1) inside the bindings at the position of (g v1).

;   (let ((u1 (f1 u v))
;         (v1 (f2 u v)))
;     (f3 u1 (h v1)))

; Note that u and v don't occur in the resulting lambda-body -- equivalently,
; they don't occur in the generalized term, (h v1).  So we rename u1 and v1
; back to u and v, resp.

;   (let ((u (f1 u v))
;         (v (f2 u v)))
;     (f3 u (h v)))

;;;;; End of example

; In general, we may not be able to eliminate the captured variables from the
; subterm.  In that case, the caller may need generate extra formals beyond
; formals1 when producing the final lambda.

; The spec is simply as follows, for returned (mv formals1 subterm1 body1).
; First, (lambda formals1 body1) is an alpha-conversion of (lambda formals
; body).  Second, subterm1 is the result of generalizing subterm by mapping
; actuals to formals1.  And finally, ((lambda formals subterm) . actuals) is
; provably equal to ((lambda formals1 subterm1) . actuals); informally, the
; meaning of subterm when binding formals to actuals equals the meaning of
; subterm1 when binding formals1 to actuals.  An informal requirement is that
; formals1 only changes variables in formals when necessary.

(mutual-recursion

; This mutual-recursion is based on deposit-term(-lst) from the ACL2 sources.
; Here we use fcons-term instead of cons-term, to avoid any normalization, and
; also the list addr may contain 0 (one or more times), designating a dive into
; a lambda-body.

(defun ext-fdeposit-term-rec (term addr subterm)

; The basic idea is simply to walk through the given term according to the
; given address addr, and then deposit the given subterm at the destination,
; where that subterm is viewed "globally", not with respect to any
; lambda-bindings in term.  Let u be the subterm of term at address addr, and
; let B* be the lambda-bindings above that subterm; we thus obtain a term that
; we write as (bind B* u).  Assume the invariant above for the call
; (ext-fdeposit-term-rec term addr subterm).  Then we claim this fundamental
; property: the result r is provably equal to term assuming provable equality
; of the terms (bind B* u) and subterm.  Note: It is easy to prove the
; following generalization by induction in the special case that (all-vars
; subterm) is disjoint from the set of variables bound by A* and B*: Assuming
; provable equality of (bind A* (bind B* u)) with subterm, then (bind A* r) is
; provably equal to (bind A* term).

; As we deposit subterm at addr in term, we attempt to use variables
; lambda-bound in term.  We use examples to illustrate how this works as we
; address some issues.

; Example 1.  Suppose we want to substitute (len (car a)) for (length (and
; (consp x) x)) into the term (let ((x (car a))) (length (and (consp x) x))).
; Of course, those are untranslated terms; here is the corresponding call for
; translated terms.

;   (let ((term '((lambda (x) (length (if (consp x) x 'nil)))
;                 (car a)))
;         (addr '(0))
;         (subterm '(len (car a))))
;     (ext-fdeposit-term-rec term addr subterm))

; We would like the result to yield (let ((x (car a))) (len x)), or more
; accurately, its translation, ((LAMBDA (X) (LEN X)) (CAR A)).  However, the
; naive result is

;   ((LAMBDA (X A) (LEN (CAR A))) (CAR A) A)

; which could be simplified to

;   ((LAMBDA (A) (LEN (CAR A))) A)

; and then to:

;   (LEN (CAR A))

; But instead of doing such simplification, consider how we can get from the
; input term

;   ((lambda (x) (length (if (consp x) x 'nil))) (car a))

; to the desired result:

;   ((LAMBDA (X) (LEN X)) (CAR A))

; The trick is that when we enter the lambda-body, we see that X is bound to
; (CAR A), so we apply the substitution binding (CAR A) to X, thus replacing
; the term to be substituted, (len (car a)), by (len x).

; Example 2.  Capture is an issue but can sometimes be avoided.  Consider the
; following slight variant of the example above: substitute (len (car x)) for
; (length (and (consp x) x)) into the term (let ((x (car x))) (length (and
; (consp x) x))).

;   (let ((term '((lambda (x) (length (if (consp x) x 'nil)))
;                 (car x)))
;         (addr '(0))
;         (subterm '(len (car x))))
;     (ext-fdeposit-term-rec term addr subterm))

; The reasoning doesn't change: we get ((LAMBDA (X) (LEN X)) (CAR X)) by
; generalizing (car x) to x, according to the lambda-binding of x to (car x),
; in (len (car x)).

; Example 3.  But now let's change the example to illustrate the capture issue.
; We start with this (untranslated) term: (let ((x (car x))) (f x)).  Now
; substitute (g (car x) x) for (f x).  If we are careless, then we generalize
; (car x) to x as before when substituting into the body of the let (or
; lambda), which would give us (let ((x (car x))) (g x x)).  The second x,
; however, refers to the global value of x, and has thus unfortunately been
; captured by the binding!  We must basically alpha-convert before substituting
; in this case; so we start with (let ((x1 (car x))) (f x1)) and substitute (g
; (car x) x) for (f x1), yielding (let ((x1 (car x))) (g x1 x)).

; A key issue, then, is to determine when alpha-conversion is necessary; more
; specifically, to determine which lambda-bound variables need to be renamed.
; From the example above it clearly suffices to prepare to substitute and then
; see if any bound variables remain.  But Example 2 shows that this condition
; is needlessly restrictive.

; A simple solution that is clearly correct is to rename only those bound
; variables that might be necessary, then generalize and substitute, and
; finally rename back when that is legal.  Let us apply this approach to the
; examples above.  The bound variables of the lambda body is {x} in all three
; examples.  In Example 1 we are substituting (len (car a)), and there is no
; intersection {x} and free variables {a} of the term to be substituted, so no
; alpha conversion is necessary.  In Example 2, where the free variables of
; (len (car x)) is {x}, we alpha convert before substituting (with
; generalization) to obtain ((lambda (x1) (len x1)) (car x)); then we rename
; back, since there is no capture, i.e., x is not free in the lambda-body (len
; x1), and obtain the desired result ((lambda (x) (len x)) (car x)).  It
; suffices to check that x is not free in the lambda-formals, since that
; implies that x is not free in the lambda-body (if we constructed a legal
; lambda).  Now consider Example 3.  Alpha conversion is necessary as in
; Example 2, so we substitute (g (car x) x) for (f x) into ((lambda (x1) (f
; x1)) (car x)), obtaining ((lambda (x1 x) (g x1 x)) (car x) x).  We cannot
; rename back because x occurs in the lambda-formals.

; We might consider optimizing to determine in advance which variables need to
; be renamed.  But for now we'll keep it simple.
