; - Perhaps add to ./package.lsp to eliminate "acl2::" prefixes below.
; - Consider showing simplified hypotheses, as was done before mid-October
;   2020.  Note however that now we simplify hypotheses and governors together,
;   so we would presumably show both.
; - Consider arranging that :backchain-limit and :repeat arguments are
;   consistent, in particular between s-cmd in before-vs-after-lemmas
;   and arguments to acl2::rewrite$ and acl2::rewrite$-hyps.  :Repeat seems
;   consistent at 3, but currently we use :repeat 1 for rewrite$-hyps -- that
;   seems reasonable, to avoid too much computation for too little gain -- and
;   :repeat 3 for simplifying subterms.
; - Consider whether sorting of runes can be done more efficiently, by doing
;   more sorting along the way.  Search below for merge-sort-lexorder.
; - Support stobjs.  Of course this will require preserving stobj declarations.
;   It might be up to the user to disable stobj accessors and updaters.
;   Although there might be no immediate need, there will likely be a need for
;   this.
; - Preserve type declarations (rather than just fetching old guard and
;   simplifying).  It may be best to preserve type and stobj declarations
;   exactly and only simplify the :guard; be careful about satisfies and about
;   :split-types.
; - If measure is not simplified, perhaps get it, untranslated, from the
;   original definition (so that macros are still present).  Note: Eric S. is
;   changing utility fn-measure in utilities/world.lisp.
; - Reconcile handling of :verify-guards with respect to eagerness and default
;   value, with how that's taken into account in simplify-defun-sk.  Eric
;   S. prefers that declare forms are what the user would write when doing a
;   transformation manually, so if one of the two approaches is closer to that,
;   let's probably use that one.
; - Move check-equivalence-relation to a general utilities file, and perhaps
;   define it using def-error-checker.
; - Arrange that fn-copy-name (defined in community book
;   books/kestrel/utilities/copy-def.lisp) uses fresh-logical-name-with-$s-suffix
;   to avoid redefinition errors.
; - Avoid hard error (in favor of soft error) when unknown keyword is
;   supplied.  (This applies also to simplify-defun-sk and simplify-term.)
; - Do something about the case that :untranslate is :nice-expanded, since
;   currently, LET expressions tend to remain.  Either avoid using the
;   augmented-term algorithm (see rewrite-augmented-term) if :untranslate is
;   :nice-expanded, or else perhaps eliminate :nice-expanded as a value for
;   :untranslate.
; - Preserve the well-founded relation.  Here is a test that one could add:
;     (include-book "std/basic/two-nats-measure" :dir :system)
;     (defun f (x y z)
;       (declare (xargs :measure (list x y)
;                       :well-founded-relation nat-list-<))
;       (if (zp x)
;           (if (zp y)
;               z
;             (f x (1- y) (1+ z)))
;         (f (1- x) (+ 2 3 y) (1+ z))))
;     ; Currently fails:
;     (simplify f)
; - Improve the check for no simplification in the defun-nx case.
;   Here is a test that one could add.  The problem in this case, which is
;   probably typical, is that the definition "changed" because
;   one body is
;   (PROG2$ (THROW-NONEXEC-ERROR 'F (LIST X)) X)
;   while the other is:
;   (PROG2$ (THROW-NONEXEC-ERROR 'F$1 (LIST X)) X)
;   The test:
;     (include-book "simplify-defun")
;     (defun-nx f (x)
;      x)
;     (must-fail (simplify-defun f))
; - Deal more completely with the case that :equiv specifies an equivalence
;   relation other than EQUAL but copy-def is called on a recursively-defined
;   function, rather than just causing an error that explains this isn't fully
;   supported.  See apt::simplify-failure (both the section on "Recursion and
;   equivalence relations" and the related comment in the defxdoc form) for
;   more information.

;;; Introductory remarks
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; This section is probably woefully incomplete, but ideally will get fleshed
; out over time.

; Consider the following questions.

; - How much work should we do when simplifying each subterm?
; - How much work should we do when simplifying :assumptions?
; - How much work should we do when simplifying governors of each subterm?

; The following two goals are critical.

; (A) Don't miss important simplifications; try to do a reasonably complete
;     simplification job.

; (B) Proofs will ideally be reliable and efficient.

; Here are some relevant observations.

; (1) The before-vs-after lemma conjoins the :assumptions and governors to form
;     the top-level hypotheses.

; (2) The proof-builder then attempts to use S to simplify those top-level
;     hyps, after diving into them.  (See before-vs-after-lemmas below.)  The
;     :assumptions could therefore be used to simplify the governors, but not
;     vice-versa.  No forward-chaining or linear will be done.
;
; (3) If the resulting top-level hyps don't allow the S command to reduce the
;     "before" to the "after", then the prover is called on to do this (using
;     ORELSE).  The prover will treat the :assumptions and governors
;     symmetrically.
;
; (4) To get the greatest subterm simplification (goal A above), it makes sense
;     to try to get the greatest simplification for top-level hypothesis, since
;     presumably normal forms are best (e.g., for rewrite rules with
;     free-variable hyps and for forward-chaining).
;
; From (2) we might want to simplify the hyps and governors separately, without
; any forward-chaining or linear.  But that is in tension with (4).  Now (3)
; suggests that we would ultimately do best to mimic the prover in support of
; reliable proofs (goal B above); fortunately, this aligns with (4).  Efficient
; proofs might give (2) more weight compared to (4), but reliability is
; probably more important than efficiency, and normally we will probably get
; efficiency anyhow.

; Inclusion of this book can affect the current-theory, because of the
; sub-books included just below, which also introduce congruence runes that can
; have an effect on the simplify-defun process (search for "congruence" in
; simplify-defun-tests.lisp to see an example involving list-equiv).  So far
; I've done nothing about this, because it could be tricky to fix without
; causing other problems.  For example, we could insert (deflabel
; start-of-simplify-defun) here and insert (in-theory (current-theory
; start-of-simplify-defun)) at the end of this book.  But then if someone tries
; to get rules from an included book after including simplify-defun, e.g., from
; community book books/std/lists/list-defuns.lisp (included via a sequence of
; included books under transformations/utilities.lisp), that included book
; ("list-defuns") would be redundant and hence its rules would remain disabled.

(defun make-fnsr (fn fn-simp fn-simp-singly-recursivep assumptions wrld)

; "Fnsr" stands for "functions record", a record that includes these symbols.

; fn      -- the given function symbol
; fn-simp -- the new function symbol
; fnc     -- either fn or fn-simp, to be copied (see below for explanation)
; fnnc    -- whichever of fn or fn-simp is not fnc

; Essay on the Implementation of Simplify-defun

; The implementation of simplify-defun has essentially these two key steps.

; (1) Call copy-def to produce a copy of fnc, named fnc-copy, together with a
;     theorem fnc-IS-fnc-copy that equates the two.

; (2) Prove fn-BECOMES-fn-simp by functionally instantiating fnc-IS-fnc-copy,
;     mapping fnc-copy to fnnc to produce the equality of fnc with fnnc, i.e.,
;     of fn with fn-simp.

; Let's see why the proof of (2) should go through.  For simplicity we ignore
; the case that the :equiv is not equal, and we defer consideration of
; assumptions.

; The proof obligation is that fnnc satisfies the definition of fnc-copy, or
; equivalently, the following:

;   (KEY)  Fnnc satisfies the definition of fnc.

; Suppose we are given the following definition.

;   (fn x)      = body

; We have presumably simplified body to a new term, body', so that the
; following equality is provable.

;   (EQ)  body = body'

; Then we introduce the following definition, where for a term u and function
; symbols g and h, we write u[g:=h] for the result of applying to u the
; functional substitution that maps g to h.

;   (fn-simp x) = body'[fn:=fn-simp]

; There are two cases, which we will call the "fn-is-fnc" and "fn-is-fnnc"
; cases: in the first, fnc is fn and fnnc is fn-simp; while in the second it is
; the other way around, namely, fnc is fn-simp and fnnc is fn.  We consider
; those two cases below.

; First consider the fn-is-fnc case, where fnc is fn and fnnc is fn-simp.  In
; that case, (KEY) says that fn-simp satisfies the definition of fn, which is
; formalized as follows.

;   (fn-simp x) = body[fn:=fn-simp]

; Equivalently, by expanding fn-simp, this equality reduces to the following.

;   (BVAL)  body'[fn:=fn-simp] = body[fn:=fn-simp]

; This equality is exactly what we call the "before-vs-after lemma" (BVAL) --
; except in the case that :simplify-body specifies subterms, in which case this
; is provable from the set of before-vs-after lemmas.  Note that fn is
; non-recursive if and only if body[fn:=fn-simp] is body, and fn-simp is
; non-recursive if and ony if body'[fn:=fn-simp] is body'.  Thus, if fn and
; fn-simp are both non-recursive, then (BVAL) is provably because it reduces to
; (EQ).  Otherwise, however, there is no guarantee that (BVAL) is provable.
; That said, we can expect it to be reasonably common that (BVAL) doesn't
; depend logically on the definition of fn, i.e., doesn't depend on any
; properties specific to fn -- and in that case, (BVAL) is indeed provable.

; (Aside.  Perhaps some day we will check that (EQ) doesn't depend on the
; definition of fn, by checking that the runes used in simplifying body to
; body' involve only events that aren't hereditarily supported by the
; definition of fn.  That check will be imperfect, however, because it relies
; on perfect tracking of runes, which we know is not the case because of
; congruence rules.  End of aside.)

; We have seen that the fn-is-fnc case supports the proof of (BVAL) if fn and
; fn-simp are both non-recursive, and quite possibly even if they are both
; recursive since then (EQ) may hold for any function symbol in place of fn,
; which gives us (BVAL).  However, if exactly one of fn and fn-simp is
; recursive -- that is, if we are transforming a recursive function to a
; non-recursive function or vice versa -- then the provability of (BVAL) is
; suspect.  In those cases, we can simplify one side of (BVAL) but not the
; other side, as indicated just below.

;   ((BVAL) for fn recursive, fn-simp not)
;   body'              = body[fn:=fn-simp]

;   ((BVAL) for fn-simp recursive, fn not)
;   body'[fn:=fn-simp] = body

; Of course, these equalities follow from (EQ) if fn and fn-simp are provably
; equal -- but that's what we're in the process of trying to prove!  Perhaps a
; more clever implementation could deal with that problem, but we don't see
; how, so we move on to the other case.

; Consider the fn-is-fnnc case.  In that case, (KEY) says that fn satisfies
; the definition of fn-simp, as follows.

;   (fn x) = body'

; But ACL2 can easily prove this theorem because it has simplified body to
; body'; indeed, it is an immediate consequence of the following
; before-vs-after lemma in the fn-is-fnnc case (again, tweaking that argument
; slightly if :simplify-body provides subterms to simplify).

;   (BVAL)  body = body'

; So shall we adopt the fn-is-fnnc case?  Doing so would guarantee the
; provability of (BVAL).

; There is a downside to the fn-is-fnnc case if simplification is done with
; respect to assumptions.  Note that copy-def relies on a lemma saying that
; assumptions are preserved for all recursive calls.  In the fn-is-fnc case,
; where we apply copy-def to fn, that lemma is based on the induction scheme
; stored for fn, a function that is presumably familiar to the user.  But in
; the fn-is-fnnc case, that lemma is based on the induction scheme stored for
; fn-simp, which isn't even defined until after running simplify-defun.

; That is, we want the reliability of the fn-is-fnnc case for (BVAL), but we
; also prefer using the induction scheme of fn to generate the assumption
; preservation lemma in the recursive case.  So we choose cases as follows.

; - If there are assumptions and both fn and fn-simp are recursive, then use
;   fn-is-fnc, so that the assumption preservation theorem is based on the
;   induction scheme for fn.

; - Otherwise use the case fn-is-fnnc, for the following reasons.

;   - The proof of (BVAL) will always succeed, where it would likely fail in
;     the case fn-is-fnc when exactly one of fn and fn-simp is recursive.

;   - If both fn and fn-simp are non-recursive, then either case would be fine;
;     but by using fn-is-fnnc, we have the simple story that fn-is-fnnc is
;     always used except when both fn and fn-simp are recursive and there are
;     assumptions.

; The decisions above seem to leave open the possibility that (BVAL) will fail
; to prove when fn and fn-simp are both recursive and there are assumptions.
; Thus, we may later add an option that can override the choice of cases,
; especially so that we can use the reliable case fn-is-fnnc when both
; functions are recursive and there are assumptions, at the cost of generating
; an assumption preservation theorem that depends on the induction scheme for
; fn-simp instead of the one for fn.

; Note that in the case that we are simplifying a mutual-recursion, we use the
; reliable case fn-is-fnnc.  We thus avoid potentially complicating the
; implementation, which handles mutual-recursion by simplifying the bodies
; sequentially, creating fnsr records at simplification time.  Also, note that
; it could complicate copy-def if fn is fnc for some functions fn in the
; mutual-recursion nest but not others; still, we could consider allowing fn to
; be fnc if every fn-simp is recursive, but note that this information is not
; available for later functions during simplification done on earlier ones.

;;; Return-last blockers
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; We attempt to preserve return-last calls, as in (prog2$ (cw ...) ...).  To do
; this, we replace return-last calls by corresponding functions.  Consider for
; example (prog2$ t1 t2).  It macroexpands to (return-last 'progn t1 t2), which
; we "block" by converting it to (prog2$-fn t1 t2).  Now (prog2$-fn x y) is
; defined to be (prog2$ x y), i.e., (return-last 'progn x y).  It is disabled
; by default.  Simplify does such "blocking" before simplification, which
; preserves the prog2$-fn call unless prog2$-fn is enabled or the call is
; expanded with a hint.  After simplification, "unblocking" restores the
; original call.

; The term "blocking" refers to the fact that some simplification is blocked by
; this procedure; for example (car (prog2$ (cw "hello") (cons x y)) will not
; simplify to x unless prog2$-fn is enabled.

; I considered similar treatment for all of
; *initial-logic-fns-with-raw-code*.  However, that list includes many
; functions that, conceivably, one may want to rewrite, including zp, floor,
; max, logand, take, and so on.  So we preserve only return-last, which covers
; the common case of preserving (prog2$ (cw ...) ...) provided the rules for
; fmt-to-comment-window are disabled.
