   ABNF is a language to describe the concrete syntax of languages.
   Being itself a language,
   ABNF has its own concrete syntax, described in RFC:4 using ABNF itself.
   To break the self-description circularity,
   we start by formalizing an abstract syntax of ABNF,
   based on an inspection of the concrete syntax in RFC:4.
   The ABNF abstract syntax abstracts away from the ABNF concrete syntax
   things that are not relevant to the ABNF @(see semantics),
   such as blank space and comments,
   as well as certain restrictions that are not needed to define the semantics.
