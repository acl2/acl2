   This plugs @('rules2') into @('rules1'), not vice versa.
   This choice is motivated by the fact that grammar rules
   are usually presented in a top-down manner,

   the ``plugged'' rules (e.g. HTTP)
   appear before the ``plugging'' rules (e.g. URI).

   Besides replacing @('prose-rules') like this,
   the plugging operation may also provide definitions
   for rule names that are only referenced in @('rules1').
   </p>
   <p>
   Prose rules in @('rules1') whose names do not have definitions in @('rules2')
   are not removed from @('rules1') and thus appear in the resulting rules.
   Similarly, rules referenced in @('rules1')
   but defined neither in @('rules1') nor in @('rules2')
   remain referenced but not defined in the resulting rules.
   These features allow multi-step plugging,

  "<p>
   It is sometimes useful to remove from a grammar
   all the rules that define certain rule names.
   </p>
   <p>
   For example, the SMTP grammar specified in
   <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc5321\">RFC 5321</a>
   references rules defined in the IMF grammar specified in
   <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc5322\">RFC 5322</a>.
   The IMF rules depend on a rule @('atom'),
   but the SMTP rules provide their own definition of @('Atom')
   (recall that rule names are case-insensitive).
   Thus, before @(see plugging) the IMF rules into the SMTP rules,
   the removal operation can be used to remove, from the IMF rules,
   @('atom') and possibly any other rule already defined by SMTP.
