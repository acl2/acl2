;; This book introduces REVERSE-LIST, a simple function to reverse a list,
;; along with several theorems about it.

(local (include-book "append"))
(local (include-book "nth"))
(local (include-book "take"))
(local (include-book "nthcdr"))
(local (include-book "true-list-fix"))
(local (include-book "no-duplicatesp-equal"))

;; TODO: Consider replacing REVERSE-LIST with REV from books/std.  But note
;; that REVERSE-LIST has a stricter guard that prevents errors, such as calling
;; it on a string, that REV will silently allow.  Also, REVERSE-LIST is simpler
;; than REV (no auxiliary REVAPPEND-WITHOUT-GUARD function).  An approach could
;; be to simply rewrite REVERSE-LIST to REV during reasoning, or perhaps to
;; define REVERSE-LIST to call REV (once the definition of REV is untangled
;; from the other stuff in books/std/lists).

;; In the logic, this is the nice recursive version of reverse, but it has a
;; fast executable body. Unlike REVERSE, this doesn't deal with strings, only
;; lists.
