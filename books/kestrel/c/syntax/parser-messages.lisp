     When an unexpected character is encountered during lexing,

    "We use @(tsee read-char) (defined later) to read characters.
     That function recognizes three new-line delimiters:
     line feed, carriage return, and carriage return followed by line feed.
     That function turns all these three into just a line feed.
     Thus, when this function is called to convert to a message
     a character coming from @(tsee read-char),
     that character has never code 13 (for carriage return),
     and if it has code 10 (line feed)
     it is not necessarily a line feed in the file,
     but it could be a carriage return possibly followed by line feed.
     For this reason, we treat the case of code 10 a bit differently,
     and our @('*ascii-control-char-names*') table
     has an internal-error-signaling entry for codes 10 and 13,
     because we do not access that table for those two codes.")

     This happens when we reach the end of the file:
     attempting to read a character returns @('nil'),
     instead of a natural number (see @(tsee read-char)).
     For error messages, it is convenient to treat this case
     similarly to the case of an actual character.
     So, for @('nil'), this function returns a description of `end of file'."))
