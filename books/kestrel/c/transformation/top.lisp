     @('const-new') specifies (the name of a constant in which to put)
     the ``new'' code resulting from the transformation,

     via the @(tsee c$::input-files) event macro,
     which produces a named constant suitable for
     the @(':const-old') input of transformations.
     Then the user invokes one or more transformations,
     and eventually the final C code is written out
     via the @(tsee c$::output-files) event macro,

     In some cases, proof generation can proceed
     all the way up to function definitions,

     combining the aforementioned @('const-new') input
     with an increasing numeric index,
     which is threaded through the transformation functions.
     The generated theorem events are accumulated into a list
     that is threaded through the transformation functions;
     the list is accumulated in reverse order,
     so that each new generated event is @(tsee cons)ed,
     but the list is reversed to the right order
     in the top-level generated event that is submitted to ACL2.")

     general utilities usable in different transformations.

     and @(see input-processing) includes utilities
     to process inputs of transformations.")))
