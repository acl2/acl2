     we unfold, by symbolic execution, all the function calls.
     This is not an ideal strategy in general,

     Eventually, we will want to generate more modular proofs,

    "In order to make these generated proofs more robust,
     we carry them out in a theory that consists exactly of
     (what we believe to be) all and only the needed rules.
     This file defines that theory, which consists of
     rules introduced elsewhere and rules introduced in this file.
     This set of rules has been defined by
     experimenting with several symbolic execution proofs,
     starting with the empty theory and adding rules
     as needed to advance the symbolic execution,
     and also by looking at the C dynamic semantics.
     There is guarantee (meta proof) that
     these rules will suffice for every use of ATC;
     there is also no guarantee that
     the proof will not be defeated by ACL2's heuristics.
     Nonetheless, the proof strategy seems sound and robust,
     and if a generated proof fails
     it should be possible to (prove and) use additional rules."))

     When the values over which a recursive function recurses are constant,

     sometimes block those expansions.

     In general, there will be some base cases and some step cases;
     the former have @('base') in the generated rule names,

     The names of the generated rules are automatically obtained

     returns optional values, i.e. values or @('nil').
     Thus, the dynamic semantics sometimes checks whether such results

     During symbolic execution, these results, when they are values,
     have the form of shallowly embedded C expressions.
     Thus, in order to establish that they are not @('nil'),
     the simplest way is to take advantage of the type prescription rules
     that ACL2 automatically generates for the functions
     that represent shallowly embedded C expressions.
     These are listed here; the list may not be exhaustive,
