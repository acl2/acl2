     (what we believe to be) all and only the needed rules.
     This file defines that theory, which consists of
     some rules introduced elsewhere and some rules introduced in this file.
     This set of rules has been defined by
     not only thinking of what is needed for symbolic execution,
     but also experimenting with several symbolic execution proofs,
     starting with the empty theory and adding rules
     as needed to advance the symbolic execution,
     and also by looking at the C dynamic semantics.
     There is no guarantee (meta proof) that
     these rules will suffice for every use of ATC;
     there is also no guarantee that
     the proof will not be defeated by some ACL2 heuristic in some cases.
     Nonetheless, the proof strategy seems sound and robust,
     and if a generated proof fails
     it should be possible to (prove and) use additional rules.")

     as well as the side-effecting updates to the starting computation state.
     Here we prove theorems expressing how
     functions like @(tsee push-frame) transform those computation states,
     maintaining their canonical form.")
   (xdoc::p
    "In @(tsee exec-fun), a scope is initialized
     and a frame is pushed with that scope.
     Here we provide two theorems to turn that into a canonical representation.
     Assuming that @(tsee init-scope) is rewritten
     to a nest of @(tsee omap::update) calls
     (as it is, because we use openers for @(tsee init-scope)),
     the two theorems below move the variables into @(tsee add-var) calls,

     No rules are needed for
     computation states that start with @(tsee write-var)
     because these only occur when executing loops,
     which do not pop frames.")
   (xdoc::p
    "We provide a single theorem about @(tsee enter-scope),
     which just turns that into @(tsee add-scope) in all cases.
     If the computation state starts with @(tsee add-frame),
     the hypothesis  that the stack frame is not empty is not needed;
     but we still prefer to have just one theorem for all cases here.")
   (xdoc::p
    "The theorems below about @(tsee exit-scope)
     cancel it with @(tsee add-scope)
     and move it past @(tsee add-var).
     No rule for @(tsee add-frame) is needed
     because that case should never happen in the symbolic execution.
     No rule is needed for computation states that start with @(tsee write-var)
     because @(tsee write-var) is always pushed past @(tsee add-scope).")
   (xdoc::p
    "The theorems below about @(tsee create-var)
     turn that into @(tsee add-var)
     when @(tsee add-frame) or @(tsee add-scope) is reached,
     because a variable is only created in the current scope.
     The third theorem skips over @(tsee add-var)
     when the two variables have different names
     (they should never have the same name during the symbolic execution),
     but note that @(tsee create-var) may return an error,
     and so we have a hypothesis about it not returning an error.
     But this may be inefficient, because it means that
     we are pushing @(tsee create-var)
     into the layers of the computation state repeatedly.
     We will look into making this more efficient.
     The reason for skipping over @(tsee add-var)s with different names
     is to exclude the case of a variable redefinition:
     attempting to prove a theorem
     that simply replaces @(tsee create-var) with @(tsee add-var),
     similarly to the theorem that
     turns @(tsee enter-scope) into @(tsee add-scope),
     fails because of the possibility of a redefined variable.
     There is no rule for @(tsee create-var) applied to @(tsee write-var),
     because @(tsee write-var)s are always pushed past @(tsee add-scope).")
   (xdoc::p
    "The theorems below about @(tsee read-var) are a bit different
     because @(tsee read-var) does not return a state, but a value instead.
     The first theorem skips over @(tsee add-scope).
     The second theorem
     either returns the value of the encountered variable or skips over it,
     based on whether the names coincide or not.
     There is no theorem for @(tsee add-frame) because this situation
     should never happen during the symbolic execution.
     The third theorem serves for variables read in loops
     that are declared outside the scope of the loop,
     i.e. that are represented as @(tsee write-var)s:
     if the two variables are the same, the value is returned;
     otherwise, we skip over the @(tsee write-var)
     in search for the variable.")
   (xdoc::p
    "The theorems below about @(tsee write-var)
     have some analogies to the ones for @(tsee create-var),
     because @(tsee write-var) may also return an error.
     The first theorem skips over @(tsee add-scope),
     but has the same kind of possibly inefficient hypothesis
     discussed above for @(tsee create-var).
     There is no rule for @(tsee add-frame) because that should not happen.
     The second and third theorems are for @(tsee add-var),
     when the variable names are the same or are different:
     when they are the same, the value in the @(tsee add-var) is replaced;
     when the names differ, we skip over the @(tsee add-var),
     but again we have the potentially inefficient hypothesis discussed.
     The fourth theorem overwrites a @(tsee write-var)
     with a @(tsee write-var) for the same variable.
     The fifth theorem is used to arrange a nest of @(tsee write-var)s
     in alphabetical order of the variable names:
     it swaps two @(tsee write-var)s when the outer one
     has an larger variable than the inner one.
     Note that we need to disable loop stoppers for this rule,
     otherwise ACL2 may not apply it based on the written value terms,
     which are irrelevant to this normalization
     based on alphabetical order.
     Note the @(tsee syntaxp) hypotheses
     that require the identifiers (i.e. variable names)
     to have the form described in @(see atc-identifier-rules).
     Finally, the sixth theorem serves to simplify the case in which
     a variable is written with its current value;
     this case may occur when proving the base case of a loop.
     This theorem is phrased perhaps more generally than expected,
     with two different computation state variables,
     instead of the simpler form in @('write-var-of-read-var-same-lemma'):
     the reason is that sometimes during symbolic execution
     a pattern arises of the form
     @('(write-var var (read-var var compst) <other-compst>)'),
     where @('<other-compst>') is a term
     that is not just the @('compst') variable:
     the rule binds @('compst1') to that.")

     in some of the other theorems below.
     We simply consume @(tsee add-scope) and @(tsee add-var),
     and stop at @(tsee add-frame) because that one adds a frame.
     For @(tsee write-var), i.e. for side-effected variables,
     we need the hypothesis that @(tsee write-var) is not an error.")
   (xdoc::p
    "The theorems below about @(tsee deref)

     During symbolic execution, there will be hypotheses saying that
     reading the variable in question does not return an error:
     so we have that hypothesis in the rule.
     The rule reduces the fact that @(tsee write-var) is an error
     to the non-equality of the types of the values,

     When the values over which a recursive function recurses are constant,

     then we know that the expansion is always safe,
     but experiments suggest that ACL2's heuristics
     sometimes block those expansions.

     (note the plural vs. singular name),
     corresponding to the conditional structure of the function.
     In general, there will be some base cases and some step cases;
     the former have @('base') in the generated rule names,
     while the latter have @('unroll') in the generated rule names.
     The names of the generated rules are automatically obtained
     via the @('defopeners-names') companion tool of @('defopeners').

     Initially the limit is a variable, and the first rule applies;
     the hypothesis of this rule is easily discharged by
     the inequality assumption over the initial limit
     in the symbolic execution theorem,
     via ACL2's linear arithmetic.
     The @(tsee syntaxp) hypothesis restricts the application of the rule
     to the case in which the limit is a variable (which is true initially).
     As the symbolic execution proceeds,
     1 gets repeatedly subtracted from the initial limit variable,
     and it appears that ACL2 automatically combines multiple 1s
     into constants larger than 1,
     giving the pattern @('(binary-+ \'<negative-integer> <limit-variable>)').

; given that *ATC-ALL-RULES* consists of thousands of rules.
; We use this theory in the generated proofs (see generation.lisp).
