    are represented in ACL2;

    the ``plain'' @('int') type consists of
    signed integers in a range from -32767 or less to +32767 or more
    (both numbers are inclusive).
    The exact range depends on the C implementation, as detailed below.")

  (xdoc::p
   "The (C, not ACL2) representation of @('int') values in memory,
    which may be visible to the C code via access as @('unsigned char[]')
    (as allowed by the [C]),
    consists of a sign bit, some value bits, and optionally some padding bits
    [C:6.2.6.2/2].
    The signed representation may be
    two's complement, one's complement, or sign and magnitude
    [C:6.2.6.2/2].
    All these choices are implementation-dependent,
    and determine the range of @('int') values,
    subject to the minimum range requirement stated above.")

  (xdoc::p
   "Two's complement representations without padding bits seem the most common,
    along with 8-bit bytes
    (the exact number of bits in a byte is also implementation-dependent
    [C:5.2.4.2.1/1] [C:6.2.6.1/3]).
    Under these assumptions, @('int') values must consist of at least 16 bits,
    resulting in at least the range from -32768 to +32767.
    [C:6.2.6.1/4] requires @('int') to take a whole number of bytes,
    and thus the possible bit sizes are 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, etc.
    [C:6.2.5/5] states that the size is
    the natural one suggested by the architecture of the execution environment.
    For modern Macs and PCs, experiments suggest this to be 32 bits
    (the experiment consists in printing @('sizeof(int)') in a C program),
    even though one might expect it to be 64 bits instead,
    given that these are 64-bit machines with 64-bit operating systems.
    (However, the C @('long') type appears to be 64 bits on these platforms.)")

  (xdoc::p
   "C provides a variety of @('int') operations,
    i.e. operations that operate on @('int') values.
    These operations also apply to other arithmetic types,
    but operands are subjected to promotions and conversions
    that reduce the possible combinations of operand types for each operation.
    For instance, the addition operation @('+') does not directly add
    @('short') or @('unsigned char') operands:
    these are promoted to @('int') values before adding them up,
    according to the integer promotions described in [C:6.3.1.1/2].
    Similarly, the addition operation @('+') does not directly add
    an @('int') operand and a @('long') operand:
    the first operand is converted to @('long') first,
    so that addition is performed on two @('long') values,
    according to the usual arithmetic conversions
    described in [C:6.3.1.8].")

    The instances for @('short') or @('unsigned char') operands,
    as well the instance for
    an @('int') first operand and a @('long') second operand,
    are less interesting because they can be viewed as
    combinations of conversions with the interesting instances.
    Thus, in the context of this tutorial page,

  "Treatment of ACL2 conditionals with @(tsee mbt) or @(tsee mbt$)."

  (xdoc::p
   "After describing how ACL2 conditionals
    represent C conditional statements and expressions
    (in @(see atc-tutorial-conditional-statements)
    and @(see atc-tutorial-conditional-expressions)),
    this tutorial page describes how certain ACL2 conditionals
    do not actually represent C conditional statements and expressions.")

  (xdoc::p
   "These are ACL2 conditionals whose tests are
    calls of @(tsee mbt) or @(tsee mbt$):
    only their `then' branches represent (and are translated to) C code;
    tests and `else' branches are ignored.")

  (xdoc::p
   "The argument of the built-in macro @(tsee mbt)
    must be provably equal to @('t') for guard verification to succeed.
    Similarly, the argument of the library macro @(tsee mbt$)
    must be provably different from @('nil') for guard verification to succeed.
    In fact, their execution is effectively skipped in guard-verified ACL2 code.
    In particular, when they appear in an @(tsee if) test,
    the `then' branch is always executed and the `else' branch is ignored.")

  (xdoc::p
   "As explained in @(see atc-tutorial-int-programs),
    ATC requires the target ACL2 functions to be guard-verified.
    Accordingly, as explained in @(see atc-tutorial-events),
    the functional correctness theorems generated by ATC
    include the target functions' guards as hypotheses.
    In other words, ATC generates C code that matches the ACL2 code
    under the guards, which must be verified for ATC to generate code.
    Thus, the behavior of the ACL2 functions or of the C code outside the guards
    is irrelevant in some precise sense:
    so long as the ATC-generated code is called
    on values that satisfy the guards,
    the behavior is provably equivalent to the ACL2 counterpart.
    (Upcoming tutorial pages will describe more precisely
    this contract between ATC-generated code and external code.)")

  (xdoc::p
   "Given the above, it should be clear why ATC ignores
    (i.e. does not generate any C code for)
    @(tsee mbt) or @(tsee mbt$) tests of @(tsee if)s
    and corresponding `else' branches,
    treating this kind of conditionals
    as if they were just their `then' branches.")

  (xdoc::p
   "Conditionals with @(tsee mbt) or @(tsee mbt$) tests
    are sometimes used in recursive ACL2 functions
    to ensure that termination can be proved.
    Recall that termination proofs ignore guards,
    which are extra-logical in ACL2
    (i.e. not part of the logic itself,
    although they give rise to proof obligations
    expressed in the logic).")

  (xdoc::p
   "Another circumstance in which @(tsee mbt) or @(tsee mbt$) may arise
    is via certain APT transformations.
    For instance, the @(tsee apt::restrict) transformation
    generates a new function whose body has the form
    @('(if (mbt$ <test>) <then> <else>)').
    As explained in @(see atc-tutorial-approach),
    ATC is meant to be used in conjunction with APT,
    namely by using APT to refine a specification into
    forms that represent C code as recognized by ATC.
    It is therefore quite possible that these APT transformations
    produce @(tsee if)s with @(tsee mbt) or @(tsee mbt$) tests,
    which make their way to ATC.")
