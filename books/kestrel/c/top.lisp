     paragraphs are referenced
     by further appending their numbers separated by slash,
     e.g. `[C17:6.2.5/2]' references Paragraph 2 of Section 6.2.5 of [C17].
     These square-bracketed references may be used
     as nouns or parenthetically.
     In the case of [GCCM] and [GCCL], we also give URL links,
     which, given the characters that form them, may be useful to locate
     documentation that has moved or otherwise changed,
     given that [GCCM] and [GCCL] are live documents;
     an example is "

     we always clearly distinguish between
     standard C and GCC extensions.")

     When there is some difference between [C17] and [C23],
     we take care to reference both."))
