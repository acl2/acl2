;; STATUS: Working prototype

;; TODO: Support adding a hook to run on each kind of event.
;; TODO: Time the events and alert the user when improvements slow things down.
;; TODO: Call the linter?
;; TODO: Time each type of event and print a report
;; TODO: Start by making sure we can replay the book (and time it).
;; TODO: Special treatment for any books used to define this tool (will be redundant, don't recommend dropping their include-books, even withn local)
;; TODO: Add the ability to suppress slow stuff (like dropping a local event or an include-book and trying the entire file).
;; TODO: Improve hints for defuns
;; TODO: Detect :guard-debug
;; TOOD: Suppress suggestions to drop set-default-parents and things to disable built-in rules.
;; TODO: Handle verify-guards
;; TODO: Handle progn
;; TODO: Handle encapsulate
;; TOOD: Handle defsection
;; TODO: Handle define (prepwork, ///, etc.)
;; TODO: Handle defrule
;; TODO: Handle with-output
;; TODO: Perhaps try turning off tau, to see if that saves a lot of time.
