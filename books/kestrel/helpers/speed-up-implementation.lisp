(in-package "ACL2")

;; This tool tries various things to speed up theorems (e.g., disabling rules
;; that were used in the proof but were not needed -- for example, the
;; definition of some function).  The speedups found should be separate from
;; those found by ACL2's useless-runes mechanism, because this tool focuses on
;; rules that do contribute to the original proof (i.e., appear in the list of
;; runes used printed in the event summary), whereas the useless-runes
;; mechanism deals with runes that do not contribute to the proof (and do not
;; appear in the summary).

;; See also improve-book.lisp, for a tool that applies this tool to an entire
;; book or set of books (along with suggesting other improvements).

;; TODO: Add support for speeding up defuns and defines.
;; TODO: Try removing cases hints
;; TODO: TODO: Handle theorems not at the top level
;; TODO: Handle defthm-flags
;; TODO: Try different ruler-extenders
;; todo: disallow print nil?
