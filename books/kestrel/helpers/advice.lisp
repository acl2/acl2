(in-package "HELP")

;; SETUP:
;;
;; 1. Execute table events to register the models, each supplying a nickname for
;; the model (a keyword), the URL of the model (a string), and the name the
;; server uses for the model (a string).  Example:
;;
;; (table advice-server :my-model '("https://example.com/machine_interface" "model1"))
;;
;; Consider putting these table events in your ~/acl2-customization.lsp.
;;
;; 2. When using this tool, consider doing (adjust-ld-history t state) so
;; that the advice tool can give advice even when the failing theorem is not
;; the most recent event.

;; Usage:
;;
;; This book provides 3 tools: defthm-advice, thm-advice, and advice.
;; - defthm-advice is like defthm but tries advice if the given hints don't prove the theorem
;; - thm-advice is like thm but tries advice if the given hints don't prove the theorem
;; - advice attempts to find the user's most recent failed proof attempt and try advice to prove it

;; TODO: Add filtering of unhelpful recommendations:
;; - (maybe) skip use-lemma when the rule had nothing to do with the goal
;; - skip add-disable-hint when the rule is already disabled (or not present?)
;; - skip add-hyp when cgen can falsify the theorem even with the hyp
;; - skip add-library when already present
;; - skip :hints that are already present or subsumed by ones already present
;; - (maybe) skip :hints that conflict with ones already present (e.g., :induct, enable vs and explicit disable)
;; - avoid anything except add-hyp when cgen can falsify the theorem (can't possibly fix the problem)
;; - (maybe) try to avoid theory-invariant errors/warnings
;; - (maybe) try to help clean up hyps (e.g., replacing a subsumed hyp when add-hyp strengthens one, maybe using tau)
;; - avoid both add-enable-hint and use-lemma of the same rule
;; - what else?

;; TODO: Maybe add a time limit for trying recommendations and keep trying more and
;; more until that limit is reached.

;; TODO: Group recommendations that need the same supporting book to be
;; included, to avoid re-including the same book later.

;; TODO: Incorporate cgen to try to see if the theorem is valid or not.  If not
;; valid, only add-hyp can help.

;; TODO: Why does getting advice take ~3 seconds?

;; TODO: Allow doing :rec <n> to try recommendation <n>

;; TODO: Consider trying the advice on the checkpoint(s), not just the goal.

;; TODO: Print times to try the recs.  Keep track of which gives the quickest proof.

;; TODO: Turn off redef (if not), to avoid prompts when including books with name clashes

;; TODO: Avoid including books that are known to be slow?

;; TODO: Avoid illegal hints, such as adding a :by when there is already a :use, or vice versa

;; TODO: Untranslate before printing (e.g., hyps)?
