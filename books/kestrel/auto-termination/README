TABLE OF CONTENTS

This directory contains files that implement a macro, defunt (or
defunT: "defun with automatic Termination"), which extends defun by
searching a database for termination schemes.  By default, that
database is produced by mining existing termination schemes from the
ACL2 community books.

I.   Introduction

This file assumes familiarity with :doc defunt.

The main idea is to create a database of termination schemes from the
community books, and then for a call of defunt to peruse that database
in order to prove termination automatically.

As of this writing, the database is initialized by including system
book "top" and then writing a termination database to file
td-cands.lisp.  That database is what's perused by a call of defunt.

There are heuristics for keeping the database from being too large.
Some, but not all, of those are discussed further below, but here are
a few now.  One key idea is to avoid storing termination clause-sets
that are too large.  Another is to simplify a bit ("normalize"), for
example by expanding calls of a few simple built-in functions like
endp, so that termination clause-sets have a better chance of agreeing
(in some suitable sense of "agree").  Another is to use subsumption to
eliminate unnecessary clause-sets.  Here is an annotated log
containing some statistics as of June 29, 2018, after including the
book "td-cands", which shows 643 distinct termination schemes
essentially shared by 821 functions, organized into 190 buckets by
"justification" (measure and other aspects).  Others (perhaps many
others) aren't included because they have been eliminated by
subsumption or heuristically-large size.

; First we compute the number of distinct "justifications", which are
; records that contain information on how a termination clause-set is
; generated from a definition, in particular the measure, well-founded
; relation, and ruler-extenders.  Note that *td-candidates* is an
; alist whose keys are all justifications, where each justification is
; associated with a record whose justification is essentially an
; alpha-variant of the key.

II.  Infrastructure/flow

PREREQUISITE.  Certify books/top.lisp and all books in the current
directory (possibly excepting td-cands.lisp and the two books that
depend on it, defunt-top.lisp and defunt-tests.lisp).

The use of defunt depends on files td-cands.lisp and td-cands.acl2,
which are generated using the steps below.  These steps are
implemented by write-td-cands.lsp, which in turn is executed by the
script write-td-cands.sh.

IMPORTANT: Files td-cands.lisp and td-cands.acl2 come with ACL2 books
distributions and are in the github repository.  It should be rare to
regenerate them.  Really, until failures start occurring with defunt
because td-cands.{lisp,acl2} haven't been updated in a long time,
there is probably no need to update.  Thus, this update procedure is
_not_ incorporated into any makefile or overall build procedure.  To
force an update, execute this at the shell:

./write-td-cands.sh

Here are the main steps implemented by this script for regenerating
td-cands.lisp and td-cands.acl2.  The complete steps are implemented
by the call of LD in write-td-cands.lsp that is made by the script
write-td-cands.sh, starting with the following:

(1) Include many of the community books together, as follows (this can
take quite a few minutes): (include-book "top" :dir :system).

(2) Create a "termination database" stobj, td, from all
singly-recursive logic-mode functions in the resulting world.

(3) Write out a book that contains "td candidates" (termination
database candidates), which are records with useful information from
the termination database stobj.  By default this book is named
td-cands.lisp.  It has an associated file of portcullis commands,
td-cands.acl2, which include many small books so that all packages are
defined that are used in td-cands.lisp.

After completing these steps, one is ready to certify the generated
book td-cands.lisp, followed by defunt-top.lisp and defunt-tests.lisp.
Of course, this can be accomplished by calling cert.pl in this
directory, or by running a regression.

After these steps, one is ready to use defunt; see :doc defunt.

III. Algorithms

Here I give only a high-level summary of some aspects of the
algorithms; many details are missing here.  I've attempted to comment
the code, which should be helpful to anyone interested in diving
deeper.  Here are just some examples of topics not discussed further
(or much) below.

- For portability, system books are represented as sysfile-p pairs
  (:system . filename), where filename is relative to the community
  books directory.

- In the second algorithm below, we use a special subsumption
  algorithm suitable for termination theorem clause-sets.  (See
  clause-set-subsumes-t-top in defunt.lisp.)

- The measure for an existing function can be a call of :?, which
  makes its termination-theorem unusable.  But :? can be our friend:
  When we generate an encapsulate with a local include-book that
  defines a function, f, where we want to use the :termination-theorem
  of f, we do so in a local defun and follow that with a redundant
  defun that uses a :? measure.  (An example appears below.)

There are two main algorithms.  First we build the termination
database, culminating in creation of files td-cands.{acl2,lisp}, which
define a list of "termination candidates".  Then each call of defunt
walks through that list, in an attempt to build an event that uses
:termination-theorem lemma instances to prove termination.

A. Building the termination database

The acronym "td" stands for "termination database" and also refers to
the stobj, td, defined in termination-database.lisp.  A key field in
that stobj is td-entry-ar, which is an array each of whose values is
either nil or else is a td-entry record.  Each such record corresponds
to one or more function symbols.  Key fields in the td-entry record
are its :root field, which is a function symbol, and its :clause-list
field, which is the "normalized" termination theorem for that function
symbol (see :doc tthm).  That theorem is represented as a list of
clauses (disjunctions), typically called a clause-set or a
clause-list.

Clause-set normalization is performed by function td-cl-lst in
termination-database-utilities.lisp.  First, the termination
clause-set for a function f with arity N is modified by replacing f
with a function td-stub-N that has no constraints.  Next, all lambdas
are removed by beta-reduction.  Next, the function norm-clause-lst is
applied to do various simplifications such as expanding calls of EQ to
calls of EQUAL, and similarly expanding calls of many other primitives
(ENDP, ZP, and so on).  Finally, unnecessary ("subsumed") clauses are
removed.  By doing those and other simplifications, we obtain a sort
of normal form that is helpful to subsumption of one clause-set by
another.

Each value in the array td-entry-ar is initially nil.  Every
singly-recursive function symbol, f, with a known measure can generate
a td-entry to place into the first unused index in that array.  There
are two possibilities:

- The normalized termination clause-set for f is subsumed by the
  clause-set of an existing entry, E, in td-entry-ar.  Then no change
  is made to td-entry-ar unless subsumption also goes in the other
  direction.  In that case, we may extend the :alt-alist field of E by
  associating f with the book in which f is defined (or nil, if f is
  built-in).  There are optimizations: for example, we do not make
  that extension if that book is already represented in E for some
  other function, g, the idea being that if we ultimately include a
  book that defines f, then g is defined too and we don't need them
  both.

- Otherwise, we add a new entry for f in td-entry-ar, and we delete
  any existing entries whose :clause-set field is subsumed by the
  normalized termination clause-set for f.

Finally, this initialized termination database is used to create
so-called "termination candidates"; see the defrec for td-candidate in
termination-database-utilities.lisp.  These candidates correspond to
the entries in the td-entry-ar field of the stobj, td.  They are
organized by justification record into an alist: each key is a
justification record, and the associated value is a list of those
candidates whose justification is alpha-equivalent to that key (in a
suitable sense; see alpha-variant-p-justification in
termination-database-utilities.lisp).  This alist is the value of
*td-candidates*, defined in td-cands.lisp.

So given a defunt call, what do we do?  We can't build its termination
clause-set because we don't yet have a measure or well-founded
relation.  But we can try all of the *td-candidates*!  Let's say that
a td-candidate record is "known" if some root in its :roots-alist is a
known function symbol in the current world.  (Every root in its
:roots-alist was of course known when td was built; but we are
probably in a much smaller world now.)

The following computation is done on behalf of a make-event call, to
produce an admissible defun event corresponding to the defun call.

- First only for known candidates, then (if that fails) for all
  candidates (including known ones):
  - Loop: For each key (a justification), get its :subset and
    :measure, then:
    - Get all injections (towards getting all new measures) from the
      :subset into the new formals.
    - For each injection, map the :measure to a new measure, m-new.
      Then:
      - Build the termination-clauses TC for the new function based on
        m-new and the well-founded relation of the key.
      - Loop: For each tc-candidate record associated with the current
        key, reduce TC by attempting to subsume each clause of TC by
        some clause in the :clause-list of the record.
      - If subsumption reduces TC to nil, then create a suitable event
        that takes advantage of each :termination-theorem of the :root
        of each tc-candidate record that participated in reducing TC.

The "suitable event" referenced above can be seen by using :trans1 on
examples in defunt-tests.lisp, as shown in the following edited log,
which illustrates the "suitable event".

IV.  Possible enhancements

See to-do.txt for a list of ideas that could lead to improvements.
Some are probably straightforward, but as of this writing it seemed
more important to document the current state of things (which seems
solid) than to tweak the code.
