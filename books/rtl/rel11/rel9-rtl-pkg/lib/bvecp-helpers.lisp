; The two events following the next local include-book were added by Matt
; K. June 2004: Some proofs require calls of expt to be evaluated, but some
; calls are just too large (2^2^n for large n).  So we use the following hack,
; which allows calls of 2^n for n<130 to be evaluated even when the
; executable-counterpart of expt is disabled.  The use of 130 is somewhat
; arbitrary, chosen in the hope that it suffices for relieving of hyps related
; to widths of bit vectors
