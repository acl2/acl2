This directory contains an ACL2 library of register-transfer logic,
developed at AMD from 1995 to 2011, at Intel from 2012 to 2016, and at
Arm from 2016 to the present, in support of the mechanical
verification of floating-point arithmetic units designed during those
periods by the respective companies.

The library's primary author is David Russinoff.  Matt Kaufmann, Eric
Smith, and Hanbing Liu have made significant contributions.  The
current version resides in the subdirectory "rel11" of this directory.

The library's core definitions and lemmas are contained in the
subdirectory "rtl/rel11/lib".  A parallel subdirectory, "support",
contains a superset of these events, including all sublemmas that were
required for the proofs of the library lemmas.  The "support"
directory is organized in such a way as to allow for the evolution of
"lib", as described in the section 'How to Create a New Release of
"books/rtl"' below.  Users should consider "lib" to be the RTL
library, and are discouraged from accessing "support" directly.

The book "lib/top" includes those books of "lib" that are generally
revelant to floating-point applications.  Other books of "lib",
pertaining to more specialized theories and applications, may be
included separately as needed.  There is no guarantee that those
specialized books are mutually compatible.  See the comments in
"lib/top.lisp" for information on each of the other books in "lib".

Arithmetic proofs with ACL2 are often cumbersome, but there exist
general-purpose arithmetic books that make the task more bearable.
The currently recommended procedure is to include the book
"books/arithmetic-5/top" along with "/books/rtl/rel*/lib/top".
Unfortunately, there are a number of incompatibilities between the two
libraries that may severely affect efficiency.  These may be
(partially) addressed by something like the following:

(in-theory (disable
  |(mod (+ x y) z) where (<= 0 z)| |(mod (+ x (- (mod a b))) y)| 
  |(mod (mod x y) z)| |(mod (+ x (mod a b)) y)| cancel-mod-+
  mod-cancel-*-const simplify-products-gather-exponents-equal 
  simplify-products-gather-exponents-<
  cancel-mod-+ reduce-additive-constant-< |(floor x 2)|
  |(equal x (if a b c))| |(equal (if a b c) x)|))

The library files contain virtually no documentation, but are
documented in a forthcoming book:

Russinoff, David M., "Formal Verification of Floating-Point Hardware
Design: A Mathematical Approach", Springer. 2018.

The books of the "lib" directory correspond to the chapters of the
book as follows:

           Chapter                  Book of lib/

 1 Basic Arithmetic Functions          basic

How to Create a New Release of "books/rtl"
=======================================================================

Any significant revision of the library should result in a new release.  We 
distinguish between a "major" revision, which is likely to involve substantial 
restructuring of the library, and a "minor" revision, consisting, perhaps, of 
a few new lemmas or definitions or changes to old ones.  Thus, we envision a 
sequence of releases,

  ...,
  "rtl/rel<n-1>.0", "rtl/rel<n-1>.1", "rtl/rel<n-1>.2", ..., "rtl/rel<n-1>.k",
  "rtl/reln.0", "rtl/reln.1", ...

If the latest release is "reln.i", then a major revision produces "rel<n+1>.0",
whereas a minor revision instead produces "reln.<i+1>".  

At any time, for given n, only one "rtl/reln.j" exists.  When "rtl/reln.j" is
created, it contains "include-book" references to "rtl/rel<n-1>.k", which
therefore must remain in place.  However, when it is eventually decided that 
"rel<n-1>.k" is no longer needed by any external applications, it may be moved
under the latest "reln.j":

        mv rel<n-1>k reln.j

Every reference to "../rel<n-1>.k" within "reln.j" must then be changed to 
"rel<n-1>.k".  While that release is no longer directly accessible as 
"rtl/rel<n-1>.k", it remains indirectly accessible as "rtl/reln.j/rel<n-1>.k", 
and the current release "rtl/reln.j" is now a self-contained directory.  Thus, 
a release "rtl/reln.j" is forever accessible (directly or indirectly) if j is 
maximal, but is otherwise replaced by "rtl/reln.<j+1>".

The recommended procedures for major and minor revisions are outlined below.


Major revision: Creation of "reln.0" as a modification of "rel<n-1>.k"
-------------------------------------------------------------------

(1.1) Create a new directory "rtl/reln.0" and copy the files "README",
      and "license.txt" from "rel<n-1>.k" to "rtl/reln.0".  Create subdirectories 
      "rtl/reln.0/lib", "rtl/reln.0/support", and "rtl/reln.0/support/0".

(1.2) Write the files "reln.0/lib/<book>.lisp" of the new library.  Among these
      should be the file "reln.0/lib/top.lisp", which simply includes all or some
      of the other books of "reln.0/lib/".  Each of the others should begin with
      the events

        (set-enforce-redundancy t)
        (local (include-book "../support/top"))

      where "reln.0/support/top.lisp" is described in Step 1.4 below, and may be 

        (a) a copy of "rel<n-1>.k/lib/<book>.lisp" (modulo local include-books), 

        (b) a modified version of "rel<n-1>.k/lib/<book>.lisp", or 

        (c) an entirely new book.  

(1.3) For each "reln.0/lib/<book>.lisp" that is neither "reln.0/lib/top.lisp" nor a
      copy of "rel<n-1>.k/lib/book.lisp", create the file "reln.0/support/0/book.lisp".
      The first event of this file is typically

        (local (include-book "../../../rel<n-1>.k/lib/top"))

      which allows the subsequent proof script (which may be distributed over 
      several files) to be developed in the context of "rel<n-1>.k/lib/".  The 
      non-local events of this script should precisely coincide with those of 
      "reln.0/lib/<book>.lisp".

(1.4) Create the file "reln.0/support/top.lisp", consisting of an "include-book"
      corresponding to each book "reln.0/lib" other than "reln.0/lib/top".  If 
      "reln.0/lib/book.lisp" is a copy of "rel<n-1>.k/lib/book", then that book 
      should be included:

        (include-book "../../../rel<n-1>.k/lib/book")

      Otherwise, the corresponding book described in Step 1.3 above should be 
      included:

        (include-book "./0/book")


Minor revision: Creation of "reln.j" as a modification of "reln.<j-1>"
-------------------------------------------------------------------

(2.1) Rename "reln.<j-1>" as "reln.j" and create the directory "reln.j/support/j"

        mv "reln.<j-1>" "reln.j"
        mkdir "reln.j/support/j"

(2.2) Revise the existing files "reln.j/lib/book.lisp" and create new ones as desired.
      Modify "reln.j/lib/top.lisp" accordingly.

(2.3) For each "reln.j/lib/book.lisp" other than "reln.j/lib/top.lisp" that has
      been revised or newly created, create the file "reln.j/support/j/book.lisp"
      as in Step 1.3 above.

(1.4) For each "reln.j/support/j/book.lisp", add to "reln.j/support/top.lisp" the
      event

        (include-book "./j/book")

      and unless this is a newly created book, delete the corresponding 
      pre-existing line.

=========================================================================
Hanbing's Hints on Creative Use of Local Include-books
=========================================================================

When revising the library involves renaming or modification of existing 
events, some creativity may be required.  We provide the following illustrative 
example.

Suppose that in a new release "rel8.3" we need to update "lib/round.lisp" by 
strengthening a theorem "foo", and that there is no "rel8.3/support/i/round.lisp" 
for any i < 3.  Then we may create the following books.

    ============================================================
    ; rel8.3/support/3/foo-new.lisp

    ; Here, prove stronger version of foo; but call it foo-new.
    ; We may find that the original version of foo is useful,
    ; We can do something like this:

     (local
      (encapsulate ()
         (local (include-book "../../../rel7.5/lib/round"))
         (defthm foo
                 ....)))   ; extract the original foo theorem.

     (defthm foo-new ...)

    ============================================================
    ; rel8.3/support/3/round-partial.lisp

    (local (include-book "../../../rel7.5/lib/round"))
    (local (include-book "foo-new"))
    <Insert all of round.lisp, except delete foo.>

    ============================================================
    ; rel8.3/support/3/round.lisp

    (local (include-book "round-partial"))
    (local (include-book "foo-new"))
    <Insert all of round.lisp, except delete foo.>
    (local (defthm foo-new ...))
    (defthm foo ... :hints (("Goal" :by foo-new)))
      
    ============================================================
    ; rel8.3/support/top.lisp

    (include-book "../../../rel7.5/lib/round.lisp") ; replace with the following:
    (include-book "3/round")


If there already exists some "rel8.3/support/i/round.lisp", and we feel that
replacing foo with the new version may affect other existing lemmas, then we 
should move to "rel9".

=========================================================================
David Rager's Notes
=========================================================================

(1) Setting up packages:

For every subdirectory in which you have internal proof scripts (to my
knowledge you have one such subdirectory) {

-- create a file called cert.acl2 in the directory that includes the
following line:

(include-book "rtl/rel11/portcullis" :dir :system)

For every file in that subdirectory {

-- replace (in-package "ACL2") with (in-package "RTL")

} }

For my own reference, we call the above approach the "Matt approach,"
and we choose this approach because you don't want to need to prefix
primitives like BITS with RTL::.

For every symbol that you want imported from the ACL2 package into the
RTL package (this only makes sense for primitives that are defined in
the ACL2 package;  for example, importing "defthmd" would make sense
[if it's not already imported], but importing "bits" would defeat most
of the purpose of our efforts) {

-- add the symbol to the list that begins on line 14 of rtl/rel11/package.lsp.

}
Email the new version of rtl/rel11/package.lsp to Rager, and he can
synchronize it with the community books for the medium-term.


(2) The "proper" way to contribute to the community books repository
is via the instructions found at the following :doc topic, but for
now, just email changes to Rager:

http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/manuals/current/manual/?topic=ACL2____GITHUB-COMMIT-CODE-USING-PULL-REQUESTS


(3) So long as no changes are made to the "lib" directory of rel11,
Dmitry has permission to cleanup the "support" directory.  Dmitry may
also make a parallel lib directory, which would be called something
more appropriate than "lib-dmitry".

Was that it?  I forget....  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
David
