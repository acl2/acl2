This directory contains the following files:

- =README.org=: This file.

- =workshops.bib=: A BibTeX file containing citation/reference data
  for publications that were presented at ACL2 workshops over the
  years, as well as at ITP 2010 which took the place of the ninth ACL2
  workshop.

  See [[https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshops.html]] for
  more information on the ACL2 workshops.

- =workshops.tex=: A TeX document which demonstrates how the entries
  in =workshops.bib= can be used.

  Note the ~\usepackage~ forms -- the use of =amssymb= is required for
  one of the paper names which contains some symbols provided by
  =amssymb=, and the use of =fontenc= is required because one of the
  authors' names contains an ogonek, which is not supported in the OT1
  internal encoding.

This data was first compiled by Jared Davis, covering the workshops
from 2000 to 2004, and later extended by Keshav Kini to cover the
workshops from 1999 to 2017.

Please keep this BibTeX resource up to date as new ACL2 workshops
occur, and feel free to correct any errors or mistakes in the data if
you find them (using a pull request to this repository).
