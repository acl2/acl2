;;; 1. Definition of a normalizing and (CR) abstract reduction

(encapsulate
 ((q (x) boolean)
  (legal (x u) boolean)
  (reduce-one-step (x u) element)
  (transform-to-valley (x) valley-proof)
  (proof-irreducible (x) proof))

;;; We define an abstract reduction relation using three functions:
;;; - q is the predicate defining the set where the reduction relation
;;;   is defined.
;;; - reduce-one-step is the function applying one step of reduction,
;;;   given an element an an operator. Note that elements are reduced by
;;;   means of the action of "abstract" operators.
;;; - legal is the function testing if an operator can be applied to a
;;;   term.

 (local (defun q (x) (declare (ignore x)) t))
 (local (defun legal (x u) (declare (ignore x u)) nil))
 (local (defun reduce-one-step (x u) (+ x u)))

;;; With these functions one can define what is a legal proof step: a
;;; r-step-p structure (see abstract-proofs.lisp) such that one the
;;; elements is obtained applying a reduction step to the other (using a
;;; legal operator).

 (defun proof-step-p (s)
   (let ((elt1 (elt1 s)) (elt2 (elt2 s))
	 (operator (operator s)) (direct (direct s)))
     (and (r-step-p s)
	  (implies direct (and (legal elt1  operator)
			       (equal (reduce-one-step elt1 operator)
				      elt2)))
	  (implies (not direct) (and (legal elt2 operator)
				     (equal (reduce-one-step elt2 operator)
					    elt1))))))

;;; And now we can define the equivalence closure of the reduction
;;; relation, given by equiv-p: two elements are equivalent if there
;;; exists a list of concatenated legal proof-steps (a PROOF) connecting
;;; the elements, such that every element involved in the proof is in
;;; the set defined by q:

 (defun equiv-p (x y p)
   (if (endp p)
       (and (equal x y) (q x))
       (and
	(q x)
	(proof-step-p (car p))
	(equal x (elt1 (car p)))
	(equiv-p (elt2 (car p)) y (cdr p)))))


;;; To state the Church-Rosser property of the reduction relation, we
;;; reformulate the propery in terms of proofs: "for every proof there
;;; is an equivalent valley proof". The function transform-to-valley is
;;; assumed to return this equivalente valley proof.

 (local (defun transform-to-valley (x) (declare (ignore x)) nil))

 (defthm Chuch-Rosser-property
   (let ((valley (transform-to-valley p)))
     (implies (equiv-p x y p)
	      (and (steps-valley valley)
		   (equiv-p x y valley)))))

;;; The normalizing property of the reduction relation is defined also
;;; in terms of proofs: for every element in the set defined by q there
;;; is a proof connecting it to an irreducible element (where
;;; irreducible means here that there is no legal operator which can be
;;; applied)

 (local (defun proof-irreducible (x) (declare (ignore x)) nil))

 (defthm normalizing
   (implies (q x)
	    (let* ((p-x-y (proof-irreducible x))

;;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

;;; To be confident of the definition of equiv-p we show that equiv-p is

;;; reduction steps.

;;; REMARK: To say it properly, we show that for the relation
;;; "exists p such that (equiv-p x y p)".

;;; REMARK: Note that in order to prove this property we do
;;; not need the properties confluence and normalizing: this is a
;;; general result that can be derived only from the definition of
;;; equiv-p and proof-step-p.

;;; NOTE: We have an "algebra" of proofs:
;;;   - append for the concatenation of proofs
;;;   - inverse-proof is already defined in abstract-proofs.lisp
;;;   - nil is the identity.

;;; REMARK: although this lemma is weaker than the statement "every two
