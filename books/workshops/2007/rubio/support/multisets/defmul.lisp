;;; Given "n-rel" a well-founded relation on a set A, and given the
;;;   components needed to extend this relation to the set of finite multisets
;;;   over A:
;;;  - "n-rel": The well-founded relation defined on A.
;;;  - "n-mp": The measure property defining the set A.
;;;  - "n-fn": The embedding justifying the well-foundedness of "rel".
;;;  - "theorem": The theorem name with rule class
;;;     "well-founded-relation" associated with "rel".
;;;  - "varx", "vary": The variables used in the "theorem".
;;; We build:
;;;  - "EXISTS-n-rel-BIGGER": Needed for "MUL-n-rel".
;;;  - "FORALL-EXISTS-n-rel-BIGGER": Needed for "MUL-n-rel".
;;;  - "MUL-n-rel": Well-founded relation on finite multisets over A.
;;;  - "MAP-n-fn-E0-ORD": The embedding justifying the well-foundedness of
;;;    "MUL-n-rel".
;;;  - "n-mp-TRUE-LISTP": The measure property defining the finite
;;;    multisets over A.
;;;  - "theorem-REWRITE": Well-founded relation theorem associated with
;;;    "n-rel", but now as a rewriting rule.
;;;  - "n-mp-TRUE-LISTP-MULTISET-DIFF": Needed for the guards verification of
;;;    "MUL-n-rel".
;;;  - "MULTISET-EXTENSION-OF-n-rel-WELL-FOUNDED": Well-founded relation
;;;    theorem associated with "MUL-n-rel".
;;;  - "EQUAL-SET-IMPLIES-IFF-FORALL-EXISTS-n-rel-BIGGER-1" and
;;;    "EQUAL-SET-IMPLIES-IFF-FORALL-EXISTS-n-rel-BIGGER-2": Some useful
;;;    congruences.


;;; We have to distinguish three cases: The two general forms recognized as
;;;   well-founded relations (the first with an explicit property "mp" and the
;;;   second with this property equal to "t"). The third case is for the
;;;   "e0-ord-<" relation (the primitive well-founded relation over
;;;   "e0-ordinalp").

; extends a well-founded relation <rel> to multisets.~/~/
; How to use: To extend a well-founded relation <rel> to multisets we need
;   know:
;   - <rel>: The well-founded relation defined on A.
;   - <theorem>: The theorem with rule class \"well-founded-relation\"
;     associated with <rel>.
;   - <mp>: The measure property defining the set A.
;   - <fn>: The embedding justifying the well-foundedness of <rel>.
;   - <varx>, <vary>: The variables used in the <theorem>.
;   and eval the \"defmul\" macro with the list of these components:
;
;   (defmul (<rel> <theorem> <mp> <fn> <varx> <vary>))
;
; The main non-local events generated by this macro call are:
;
;   - the definitions needed for the multiset relation induced by <rel>:
;     functions exists-<rel>-bigger, forall-exists-<rel>-bigger and
;     mul-<rel>.
;   - the definition of the multiset measure property, <mp>-true-listp.
;   - the definition of mp-<fn>-e0-ord, the embedding function from
;     multisets to ordinals.
;   - the well-foundedness theorem for mul-<rel>, named
;     multiset-extension-of-<rel>-well-founded.
;
; To see the complete list of generated events use :trans1 on a defmul call.
;
; We expect defmul to work without assistance from the user. After the
; above call to defmul, the function mul-<rel> is defined as a
; well-founded relation on multisets of elements satisfying the property
; <mp>, induced by the well-founded relation <rel>. From
; this moment on, mul-<rel> can be used in the admissibility test
; for recursive functions to show that the recursion terminates.
;
;
; This macro has three optionals arguments:
;   :prefix <prefix> : With this argument we can use <prefix> as a prefix for
;     the names of the events builded.
;   :rule-classes <classes> : With this argument we can propose <classes> as
;     additional rule-classes for the well-founded relation theorem
;     associated with the multiset extension. The default value is
;     :well-founded-relation.
;   :verify-guards <expr> : The value of <expr> must be T or NIL. With this
;     argument we can decide when the guards of the functions builded must be
;     verified on definition time.
;
; To know the list of names that we need to supply to a  \"defmul\" call, we
;   have developed a tool to look up the Acl2 \"world\" and print that list:
;
;   (defmul-components <rel>)
;
; This is only an informative tool, not a event. This macro looks up the Acl2
;   \"world\", and informs if some symbols (those that the \"defmul\" macro
;   builds) have been already defined. As the \"defmul\" macro, has one
;   optional argument to propose a prefix:
;   :prefix <prefix> : With this argument we can use <prefix> as a prefix for
;     the names of the events builded.
;
; An example:
;
;   (encapsulate
;    ((my-mp (v) booleanp)
;     (my-rel (v w) booleanp)
;     (my-fn (v) e0-ordinalp))
;
;    (local (defun my-mp (v) (declare (ignore v)) nil))
;    (local (defun my-rel (v w) (declare (ignore v w)) nil))
;    (local (defun my-fn (v) (declare (ignore v)) 1))
;
;    (defthm my-rel-well-founded-relation
;      (and (implies (my-mp v) (e0-ordinalp (my-fn v)))
;   	   (implies (and (my-mp v)
;   			 (my-mp w)
;   			 (my-rel v w))
;   	     (e0-ord-< (my-fn v) (my-fn w))))
;      :rule-classes :well-founded-relation)
;
;    (defun map-my-fn-e0-ord (l)
;      l))
;
;   ; (defmul-components my-rel)
;   ; => WARNING: The symbol MAP-MY-FN-E0-ORD is defined yet. Perhaps you must
;   ;    use the :PREFIX option.
;   ;
;   ;    The list of components is:
;   ;     (MY-REL MY-REL-WELL-FOUNDED-RELATION MY-MP MY-FN V W)
;   ;
;   ; (defmul-components my-rel :prefix new)
