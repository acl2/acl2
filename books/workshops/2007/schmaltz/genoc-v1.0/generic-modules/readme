1 Structure of the books for GeNoC
-----------------------------------

1.1 GeNoC-types
--------------

        This book defines the data types used in GeNoC: transactions,
missives, travels, etc. It contains basic functions used to manipulate
these datatypes.
        It does not import any book.

1.2 GeNoC-misc
--------------

        This book imports GeNoC-types.
        This book contains miscellaneous definitions. For instance, it
defines predicates like CorrectRoutep, the filtering operator extrac-sublst,
some lemmas about subsetp, etc.

1.3 GeNoC-nodeset
-----------------

        This book contains functions about the definition and the validation
of the set of the existing nodes of a particular network.
        It does not import any book.

1.4 GeNoC-routing
-----------------

        This book imports GeNoC-nodeset and GeNoC-misc.
        It contains functions about the definition and the validation
of the routing algorithm.

1.5 GeNoC-scheduling
--------------------

        This book imports GeNoC-misc and GeNoC-nodeset.
        It contains functions about the scheduling policy of GeNoC. It
also adds some lemmas used in the final proof. These lemmas link
functions like extract-sublst, missivesp, etc. They are about NodeSet
and this is why we need the corresponding book.

1.7 GeNoC-interfaces
--------------------

        This book contains functions about the definition and the validation
of the interfaces.
        It does not import any book.

1.7 GeNoC
---------
        This book imports the previous books. It contains the definition
of GeNoC and its proof of correctness.

1.8 Global Structure
--------------------

        The global "book tree" is the following:

                                 GeNoC
                        /         |               \
       GeNoC-scheduling    GeNoC-routing       GeNoC-interfaces
         |          |      |          |
 GeNoC-nodeset     GeNoC-misc     GeNoC-nodeset
                       |
                   GeNoC-types
