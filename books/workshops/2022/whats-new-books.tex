\begin{itemize}

\item Added macro \code{checkpoint-list},
  which provides a programmatic, flexible interface
  to the key checkpoint information.

\item A new ACL2 Lint tool can detect common ACL2 errors.

\item Reasoning about I/O channels has been improved.

  reading a value from a file into a defconst, and printing constants
  nicely.

\item A new tool, bind-from-rules can bind free variables in rules by
  searching existing rules.

  defopeners-mut-rec.

\bookpath{kestrel/utilities}: Utilities in the Kestrel books (2).

\begin{itemize}

\item A new data structure, string trees, can efficiently represent a
  sequence of strings (e.g., for writing to a file).

\item A new tool supports polarity-based rewriting, whereby a term can
  be either strengthened or weakened depending on whether it is an
  assumption or a conclusion.

\item New sorting utilities, including \code{split-list-fast},
  \code{merge-sort-generic}, and \code{defmergesort}.

\item New xdoc constructors, e.g., one that creates xdoc paragraphs
  from blocks of text separated by blank lines.

\item A new tool, \code{gen-xdoc-for-file}, to generate xdoc topics
  for every event in a file by extracting the relevant lines of code
  (the definition and any immediately preceding or following comment
  lines).

\item Helpful wrappers for xdoc archiving utilities.

  quoted entities, building strings, checking whether a symbol has
  properties, dealing with runes, parsing options, processing keyword
  args, and recognizing legal variable names.

\item New utilities about imported symbols, format strings,
  printing, translation, manipulating terms, invariant risk,
  submitting events to ACL2, creating temp dirs, process IDs,
  usernames, calling scripts, macroexpansion and translation, and asserts.

\item New utilities about redundant events, guard-holders, ruler-extenders,
  \code{let}s/\code{lambda}s, fake worlds, clause identifiers,
  \code{progn}, unification, dependencies, ensuring rules are known,
  quieting \code{make-event}, processing \code{defun} and \code{defthm} forms,
  processing \code{declare}s, the ACL2 \code{state}, \code{system-books-dir},
