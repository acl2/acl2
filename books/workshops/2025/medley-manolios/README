Book for the paper _Cellular Automata Surviving k Steps_ by Zeke
Medley and Panagiotis Manolios.

`automata.lisp` formalizes inhomogeneous elementary cellular automata
[1] and the Survive-k-Steps problem introduced by Wolfram in a series
of blog posts [2][3][4].

`technique1` proves that odd-numbered elementary cellular automata
cannot be composed to survive k steps. `technique2` proves that if a
set of automata cannot be composed to transition from a state with a
live cell to a state with no live cells, then the automata cannot be
composed to survive k steps.
