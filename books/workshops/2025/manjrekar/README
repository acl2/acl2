To certify the clause processor, use:
    cert.pl ctv-cp.lisp

The files imul8.lisp and imul64.lisp in the "examples" folder have been
generated from the corresponding .cpp files using the RAC parser (see
documentation in "books/projects/rac/README.md"). The proofs in the examples can
be certified using:
    cert.pl examples/imul*/*.lisp
