;;; 1. Terms
;;; ============================================================================



;;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; 1.1 Representation of terms
;;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

;;; We will represent first-order terms in prefix notation, using
;;; lists. For example, the term f(x h(a) g(x y b)), where x, y are
;;; variables and a, b are constants is represented as
;;; (f x (h (a) (g x y (b)).
;;; Note that constants are considered as 0-ary functions.


;;; The following functions define the set of well-formed terms (and
;;; list of terms) in a given signature We will prove later that our
;;; main functions acting on terms are closed in the set of terms of a
;;; given signature (the closure theorems).

;;; A signature is defined to be a function of two arguments. The
;;; intended meaning is that receiving as input a symbol function and a
;;; natural number, we return t if the arity of the symbol is n, and nil
;;; otherwise. This will allows to represent infinite signatures and
;;; variadic symbol functions.

;;; A general signature:

(defstub signat (* *) => *)


;;; EXAMPLE:
;;; This is for example, the signature of group theory
; (defun signat (symb n)
;   (let* ((sig '((* 2) (i 1) (e 0)))
; 	 (found (assoc symb sig))
; 	 (arity (cdr found)))
;     (and found (member n arity))))


;;; The variables of terms in a given signature, will be restricted to
;;; eqlablep ACL2 objects. This is due to two reasons:
;;; - First we restrict the kind objects that can be considered as
;;;   variables in a given language, to discard "strange" cases.

;;; - Second, in this way well-formed terms (as defined by term-p below)
;;;   can be seen as terms in a particular signature. This will allow to
;;;   export the closure theorems to guard theorems, as we will see.

;;; Thus we define variable-s-p as eqlablep, a predicate for recognizing
;;; variables of terms in a given signature.

(defmacro variable-s-p (x) `(eqlablep ,x))

;;; ====== TERM-S-P, TERM-S-P-AUX


;;; term-s-p-aux define terms and lists of terms in a given
;;; signature. We define at the same time terms and lists of terms,
;;; using a standard trick for mutual recursion. (term-s-p-aux flg x) is
;;; t if flg=nil and x is a list of terms in a signature or flg /= nil
;;; and x is a term in a signature. Nil otherwise.

(defun term-s-p-aux (flg x)
  (if flg
      (if (atom x)
	  (variable-s-p x)
	(if (signat (car x) (len (cdr x)))
	    (term-s-p-aux nil (cdr x))
	  nil))
    (if (atom x)
	(equal x nil)
      (and (term-s-p-aux t (car x))
	   (term-s-p-aux nil (cdr x))))))

(defmacro term-s-p (x)
  `(term-s-p-aux t ,x))


;;; ====== TERM-P, TERM-P-AUX


;;; For guard verification purposes, we will define a function term-p
;;; defining "proper" representation of first-order terms, i.e., the
;;; kind of Common Lisp objects that our functions are expected to
;;; receive as input when executed. As for terms in a signature, this is
;;; done for terms and for lists of terms.  Note that we require that
;;; variables and function symbols have to be eqlablep objects. This
;;; will allow us to use eql instead of equal in executable functions,
;;; making them more efficient.


(defun term-p-aux (flg x)
  (declare (xargs :guard t))
  (if flg
      (if (atom x)
	  (eqlablep x)
	(and (eqlablep (car x))
	     (term-p-aux nil (cdr x))))
    (if (atom x)
	(equal x nil)
      (and (term-p-aux t (car x))
	   (term-p-aux nil (cdr x))))))

(defmacro term-p (x)
  (declare (xargs :guard t))
  `(term-p-aux t ,x))




;;; VERY IMPORTANT REMARK: NON-PROPER TERMS
;;; ***************************************

;;; Having defined the above functions, nevertheless, since ACL2 is a
;;; logic of total functions, our functions acting on terms are defined
;;; for every object, even for those not representing "proper" terms, as
;;; defined by term-s-p and term-p. Our definitions will deal
;;; with the "non-proper" case in such a way that our theorems do not
;;; need hypothesis of the form "(term-p term)" or "(term-s-p term)"
;;; (except those concerning guard verification or closure properties,
;;; as we will see later).

;;; Thus, we can see any ACL2 object as a representation of a term, in
;;; the following way:

;;; - Variables are atomic objects.
;;; - Every consp object can be seen as the term with the top function
;;;   symbol in its car. The cdr is the list of its arguments.


;;; ====== VARIABLE-P
;;; x is a variable (in a wide sense)
;;; Similar to variable-s-p, we define variable-p, recognizing those
;;; ACL2 objects that can be considered as variables with this wide
;;; point of view.

(defun variable-p (x)
  (declare (xargs :guard t))
  (atom x))

;;; REMARKS:
;;; --------

;;; - Note that this function variable-p is not strictly needed (we
;;;   could use atom), but it improves readability of the proofs
;;;   developed by the prover.
;;; - This could be optimized if we used a macro definition instead of
;;;   defun. But we prefer to disable variable-p after proving its main
;;;   properties, for the sake of readability of theorems and proofs
;;;   (maybe we will modify it later).
;;; - Note that variable-s-p implies variable-p. The reverse implication
;;;   is not true.


;;; Before disabling variable-p, we prove its main property:

(defthm non-variables-are-consp
  (equal (variable-p x)
	 (not (consp x)))
  :rule-classes :compound-recognizer)

(in-theory (disable variable-p))


;;; IMPORTANT REMARK: from the discussions above, note that we are
;;; guided by the following principle:

;;; - To reason, it is better not to restrict the kind of objects we are
;;; deling with, since the theorems are more general, and often easier
;;; to prove (in addition, we will prove the corresponding closure
;;; theorems).
;;; - For execution (i.e., for guard verification), it is better to restrict
;;; if we can improve eficiency. For example, restricting variables and
;;; function symbols to be eqlablep objects allows us to replace eql by
;;; equal (when comparing variables or function symbols).

;;; ==== SOLUTION
;;; Solution of system of equations.
;;; A substitution is a solution of a system if its a solution of every
;;; member of the system. A substitution sigma is a solution of an
;;; equation ecu if sigma(car(ecu)) = sigma (cdr (ecu)). Two systems are
;;; equivalent if they have the same set of solutions.

;;; ===== IDEMPOTENT SYSTEMS/SUBSTITUTIONS

;;; Some substitutions are solution
;;; of themselves. We then call that substitution idempotent.
;;; Its domain is a set of variables and the variables of its
;;; co-domain are disjoint with its domain.

(defun idempotent (S)
  (and (system-substitution S)
       (disjointp (variables nil (co-domain S)) (domain S))))

;;; REMARK: In the literature, idempotent substitutions are defined as
;;; substitutions sigma such that sigmaиsigma = sigma. But this
;;; definition involves functional equality. We will see that the above
;;; definition implies this property (see main-property-mgs in the book
;;; unification-definition.lisp) Nevertheless, the definition does not
;;; characterize the property. For example, the substitution represented
;;; by ((x . y) (x . z)) verify that property but is not idempotent in
;;; our sense. Fortunately, it can be proved that there exists a
;;; functionally equivalent idempotent (in our sense) substitution, ((x
;;; . y)) in this case.

; We want to prove idempotence-main-lemma (see below)
; idempotence-main-lemma fails in:

;          (IMPLIES (AND (SOLUTION S X)

;                          (APPLY T S W))).


; Strategy to prove this:

; 1) (apply-subst t sigma v) is (val v sigma) if sigma is
; system-substitution and (v . w) is in sigma
; 2) (val v sigma) is w si (v . w) is in s and (domain s) is setp
; 3) (apply-subst t sigma w) is w if (domain s) is disjoint with
