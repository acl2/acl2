This is the weak defun-sk macro and it is based on the defun-sk macro.
I only thought about existential quantification.  Do a macro-expansion
to see what it produces, but essentially it produces a function with
only one constraint: this allows you to prove the function is non-nil
if you can exhibit a witness.  Many times that is all one needs.
