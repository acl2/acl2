; TODO and FIXME items to consider doing:
; - Consider adding missing arguments (:skip-termination, :skip-guard-proof,
;   :rewrite-assumptions, :measure).
; - Perhaps convert this file to guard-verified :logic mode.
; - Add more error checking, e.g.: avoid Lisp error when quoting first
;   argument as in (simplify-defun 'foo) instead of (simplify-defun foo).
; - Provide a general way to specify hints, not just in-theory hints.
; - Probably change defaults for simplify-guard and simplify-measure to 't
;   (after everything is working).
; - If measure is not simplified, perhaps get it, untranslated, from the

; Inclusion of this book can affect the current-theory, because of the

; I've done nothing about this, because could be tricky to fix without causing
; other problems.  For example, we could insert (deflabel
; start-of-simplify-defun) here and insert (in-theory (current-theory
; start-of-simplify-defun)) at the end of this book.  But then if someone tries
; to get rules from an included book after including simplify-defun, e.g., from
; community book books/std/lists/list-defuns.lisp (included via a sequence of
; included books under transformations/utilities.lisp), that included book
; ("list-defuns") would be redundant and hence its rules would remain disabled.

(defun make-fnsr (fn fn-simp fn-simp-singly-recursivep assumptions wrld)

; "Fnsr" stands for "functions record", a record that includes these symbols.

; fn      -- the given function symbol
; fn-simp -- the new function symbol
; fnc     -- either fn or fn-simp, to be copied (see below for explanation)
; fnnc    -- whichever of fn or fn-simp is not fnc

; Essay on the Implementation of Simplify-defun

; The implementation of simplify-defun has essentially these two key steps.

; (1) Call copy-def to produce a copy of fnc, named fnc-copy, together with a
;     theorem fnc-IS-fnc-copy that equates the two.

; (2) Prove fn-BECOMES-fn-simp by functionally instantiating fnc-IS-fnc-copy,
;     mapping fnc-copy to fnnc to produce the equality of fnc with fnnc, i.e.,
;     of fn with fn-simp.

; Let's see why the proof of (2) should go through.  For simplicity we ignore
; the case that the :equiv is not equal, and we defer consideration of
; assumptions.

; The proof obligation is that fnnc satisfies the definition of fnc-copy, or
; equivalently, the following:

;   (KEY)  Fnnc satisfies the definition of fnc.

; Suppose we are given the following definition.

;   (fn x)      = body

; We have presumably simplified body to a new term, body', so that the
; following equality is provable.

;   (EQ)  body = body'

; Then we introduce the following definition, where for a term u and function
; symbols g and h, we write u[g:=h] for the result of applying to u the
; functional substitution that maps g to h.

;   (fn-simp x) = body'[fn:=fn-simp]

; There are two cases, which we will call the "fn-is-fnc" and "fn-is-fnnc"
; cases: in the first, fnc is fn and fnnc is fn-simp; while in the second it is
; the other way around, namely, fnc is fn-simp and fnnc is fn.  We consider
; those two cases below.

; First consider the fn-is-fnc case, where fnc is fn and fnnc is fn-simp.  In
; that case, (KEY) says that fn-simp satisfies the definition of fn, which is
; formalized as follows.

;   (fn-simp x) = body[fn:=fn-simp]

; Equivalently, by expanding fn-simp, this equality reduces to the following.

;   (BVAL)  body'[fn:=fn-simp] = body[fn:=fn-simp]

; This equality is exactly what we call the "before-vs-after lemma" (BVAL) --
; except in the case that :simplify-body specifies subterms, in which case this
; is provable from the set of before-vs-after lemmas.  Note that fn is
; non-recursive if and only if body[fn:=fn-simp] is body, and fn-simp is
; non-recursive if and ony if body'[fn:=fn-simp] is body'.  Thus, if fn and
; fn-simp are both non-recursive, then (BVAL) is provably because it reduces to
; (EQ).  Otherwise, however, there is no guarantee that (BVAL) is provable.
; That said, we can expect it to be reasonably common that (BVAL) doesn't
; depend logically on the definition of fn, i.e., doesn't depend on any
; properties specific to fn -- and in that case, (BVAL) is indeed provable.

; (Aside.  Perhaps some day we will check that (EQ) doesn't depend on the
; definition of fn, by checking that the runes used in simplifying body to
; body' involve only events that aren't hereditarily supported by the
; definition of fn.  That check will be imperfect, however, because it relies
; on perfect tracking of runesx, which we know is not the case because of
; congruence rules.  End of aside.)

; We have seen that the fn-is-fnc case supports the proof of (BVAL) if fn and
; fn-simp are both non-recursive, and quite possibly even if they are both
; recursive since then (EQ) may hold for any function symbol in place of fn,
; which gives us (BVAL).  However, if exactly one of fn and fn-simp is
; recursive -- that is, if we are transforming a recursive function to a
; non-recursive function or vice versa -- then the provability of (BVAL) is
; suspect.  In those cases, we can simplify one side of (BVAL) but not the
; other side, as indicated just below.

;   ((BVAL) for fn recursive, fn-simp not)
;   body'              = body[fn:=fn-simp]

;   ((BVAL) for fn-simp recursive, fn not)
;   body'[fn:=fn-simp] = body

; Of course, these equalities follow from (EQ) if fn and fn-simp are provably
; equal -- but that's what we're in the process of trying to prove!  Perhaps a
; more clever implementation could deal with that problem, but we don't see
; how, so we move on to the other case.

; Consider the fn-is-fnnc case.  In that case, (KEY) says that fn satisfies
; the definition of fn-simp, as follows.

;   (fn x) = body'

; But ACL2 can easily prove this theorem because it has simplified body to
; body'; indeed, it is an immediate consequence of the following
; before-vs-after lemma in the fn-is-fnnc case (again, tweaking that argument
; slightly if :simplify-body provides subterms to simplify).

;   (BVAL)  body = body'

; So shall we adopt the fn-is-fnnc case?  Doing so would guarantee the
; provability of (BVAL).

; There is a downside to the fn-is-fnnc case if simplification is done with
; respect to assumptions.  Note that copy-def relies on a lemma saying that
; assumptions are preserved for all recursive calls.  In the fn-is-fnc case,
; where we apply copy-def to fn, that lemma is based on the induction scheme
; stored for fn, a function that is presumably familiar to the user.  But in
; the fn-is-fnnc case, that lemma is based on the induction scheme stored for
; fn-simp, which isn't even defined until after running simplify-defun.

; That is, we want the reliability of the fn-is-fnnc case for (BVAL), but we
; also prefer using the induction scheme of fn to generate the assumption
; preservation lemma in the recursive case.  So we choose cases as follows.

; - If there are assumptions and both fn and fn-simp are recursive, then use
;   fn-is-fnc, so that the assumption preservation theorem is based on the
;   induction scheme for fn.

; - Otherwise use the case fn-is-fnnc, for the following reasons.

;   - The proof of (BVAL) will always succeed, where it would likely fail in
;     the case fn-is-fnc when exactly one of fn and fn-simp is recursive.

;   - If both fn and fn-simp are non-recursive, then either case would be fine;
;     but by using fn-is-fnnc, we have the simple story that fn-is-fnnc is
;     always used except when both fn and fn-simp are recursive and there are
;     assumptions.

; The decisions above seem to leave open the possibility that (BVAL) will fail
; to prove when fn and fn-simp are both recursive and there are assumptions.
; Thus, we may later add an option that can override the choice of cases,
; especially so that we can use the reliable case fn-is-fnnc when both
; functions are recursive and there are assumptions, at the cost of generating
; an assumption preservation theorem that depends on the induction scheme for
; fn-simp instead of the one for fn.

; Note that in the case that we are simplifying a mutual-recursion, we use the
; reliable case fn-is-fnnc.  We thus avoid potentially complicating the
; implementation, which handles mutual-recursion by simplifying the bodies
; sequentially, creating fnsr records at simplification time.  Also, note that
; it could complicate copy-def if fn is fnc for some functions fn in the
; mutual-recursion nest but not others; still, we could consider allowing fn to
; be fnc if every fn-simp is recursive, but note that this information is not
; available for later functions during simplification done on earlier ones.

; As with the original simplify-body, no arguments are evaluated except for
; assumptions.

; Note that simplification of the guard is done without assuming the
; :assumptions, since the :assumptions might simplify the guard away.  The
; measure's simplification also does not use the :assumptions; consider for
; example the case that :assumptions is (natp x), which might be the guard, and
; the measure is (nfix x), which must not simplify to x.

; As things currently stand, if :simplify-body is non-nil then the body must
; simplify; but we do not make the analogous requirement for :simplify-guard or
; :simplify-measure.

; Note that :simplify-body may be a pattern.  See :doc simplify-defun.
