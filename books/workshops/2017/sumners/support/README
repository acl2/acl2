Rob Sumners,
Proof Reduction of Fair Stuttering Refinement of Asynchronous Systems
and Applications.

Brief description of the certifiable books in this directory:

sets.lisp -- some set theory using hypothesis-free rules and normalized set
             representation

bounded-ords.lisp -- a book of operations on so-called bounded ordinals which
                     are really bounded nat. lists and lists of bounded nat lists
                     and mappings of these things to ordinals with various properties.

general-theory.lisp -- system-level theory to prove reduction for fair
                       stuttering refinement to single step properties

trans-theory.lisp -- transaction or task-level theory to prove reductions from
                     system-level properties to properties relating tasks

bakery.lisp -- example of (prove-tr-refinement) macro generating proofs. in
               this case for a version of the bakery algorithm against a
               specification system.

cert.pl bakery will build everything..
