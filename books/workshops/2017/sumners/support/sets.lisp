We define the common boolean operations (and a few other common useful notions)
on sets canonicalized as ordered lists using Pete's total ordering of all ACL2
objects. Further, the functions have been defined with a normalization of all
ACL2 objects as appropriate sets (we define a 1-1 function which maps any ACL2
object to a corresponding well-formed set) and using this normal (and its
inverse), we can prove properties about normalized set operations which use
equal-ity instead of set-equality and require no backtracking to relieve
well-formed set hypotheses.

EXPORTED logic functions:

   (in e x)      -- set membership predicate, is element e a member of set x
   (subset x y)  -- subset predicate, is set x a subset of set y
   (isect x y)   -- the set intersection of set x and set y
   (unite x y)   -- the set union of set x and set y
   (sdiff x y)   -- the set of elements in set x but not in set y
   (card x)      -- returns the number of objects in the set x
   (s1 e)        -- the singleton set consisting only of the element e
   (scar x)      -- the least (by <<) element in the set x, nil if x is empty
   ()            -- NIL is unique representative value for empty set,
                    so use NULL or NOT to test a set for emptiness
   (c1 x)        -- test which returns true if x is a singleton set

EXPORTED theorems provided at the end of this file.

I have removed all of the subgoal hints except for those introduced by the
macro defthm-ternary-sets. These subgoal hints are reasonable since they are
introduced in the context of a provided induction scheme and they help speed
the proofs through considerably by avoiding the problem in ACL2 of
free-variable matching in the application of <<-transitive.

The following rule subsumes yours and I think would be
a better addition:

(defthm sdiff-superset
  (implies (subset x y)
           (equal (sdiff x y)
                  (empty-set))))

> ;(add similar lemmas about other functions than unite

>
> ;and can you prove this one for me?
> (defthm sdiff-sdiff
>   (equal (sdiff (sdiff x y) y)
> 	 (sdiff x y))
> )

absorption rules for unite, isect, and sdiff (on the right)
would be good. I have no idea why I had not considered adding
these before. I will probably generalize them to have subset
hypothesis.

It is in one of the workshops, although I am uncertain if it
is updated. I will probably get Matt to add it to the misc
directory (especially with some of the recent additions to
the records book which make use of the sets book).

> I also need:

Hmmm. I am uncertain if this is a proper reduction. Intuitively,
while the lhs is a bigger term, it is smaller in terms of
cardinality. I will need to think about this case, but offhand,
I don't see this as an obviously good addition to the sets book.

Please feel free to make suggestions (just don't expect that I
will always be quick in handling the suggestions). I like using
the sets book and would like to see others use it as well. (I am
generally an advocate of having books with rewrite rules which
are "context-free" -- well as context-free as possible).

Excellent.

My sense is that people aren't using the records/maps
book enough (and that, in general, people don't
appreciate the importance of the tricks done to make
the records book clean).  Did anyone ever give a talk
on records/maps at the ACL2 seminar?

I'm changing my copy of the "M5" JVM model to use
records, and I think this is clearly the way to go.
(There are some subtleties, but I now have a fairly
clean algebra for the heap.)  If J's folks keep
hearing about this from enough people, maybe they'll
use records for M6.  Hanbing seems to be in charge of
M6.

That would be great!  Thanks.  I've been spending a
lot of time making changes to M5 and thinking about
sets, maps, and other implementation details, instead
of actually doing the proofs I'm supposed to be doing
(about java.util.linkedlist).  Even so, Dill seems
satisfied with my progress.  Once we get the JVM model
(and the sets and maps books) stabilized, I should be
much more productive and should be able to totally
impress him.

Thanks,
-Eric
