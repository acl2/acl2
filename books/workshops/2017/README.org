Supporting materials should go into directories named after authors of
accepted papers.  Typically, they go into a ~support/~ subdirectory of
each such directory; see past directories [[/books/workshops/]]20??/ for
examples.

Note: If you are not a frequent contributor to the community books,
you will likely be using pull requests if you contribute books using
git.  See ~:doc git-quick-start~, e.g. [[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/manuals/current/manual/index.html?topic=ACL2____GIT-QUICK-START][in the online XDOC manual]].
