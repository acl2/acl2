;; Notes:
;;   How do we identify the "conclusion" from a list of hypotheses?
;;     note-note: Mark's RewriteExpt uses the hypothesis list to figure out
;;       which transformations can be applied.
;;     note-note-yan: Yan's returned clauses also depend on knowing the
;;       corresonding hypothesis.
;;     1:  Maybe we can just use the last disjunct as the conclusion?
;;     2:  Maybe we measure the size of each expression tree and assume that
;;           the largest is the conclusion?
;;     3:  Maybe we could add a function (defun conclusion (x) x), and
;;           recognized (conclusion concl) as indicating the conclusion?
;;     4:  Maybe Yan will have a better idea.
