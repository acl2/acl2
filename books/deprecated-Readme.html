<H1>The ACL2 Books Directory</H1>

<hr size=5 noshade>

<p><b><font color="red">WARNING</font>: This page is deprecated.  As
  of early 2014, this file is mostly up-to-date.  However, moving
  forward, we have decided to provide an "index" into the books
  through the xdoc manual.  Thus, we recommend that instead of
  updating this file, that you use the xdoc system to document your
  book, and then include your book's documentation by adding it to
  books/doc/top.lisp.</b></p>

<hr size=5 noshade>

<p>
  If you particularly want to, you should feel free to add 
  a pointer to your work in this file, but you shouldn't consider it to be the
  way of documenting your work that will reach the most people.
</p>

<P>
The word ``book'' has two senses to the ACL2 user.  One is the normal one: a
sequence of printed paper pages bound together between covers.  There are
such books about ACL2.  Click <A
HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/publications/acl2-papers.html">here</A>
for more information.
<P>
The other sense is a technical one: an ACL2 ``book'' is a file of
definitions, theorems and other commands used to extend ACL2's reasoning
abilities.  Commands add ``rules'' to ACL2's data base.  When a book is
``certified,'' ACL2 checks that all the commands in it can be successfully
processed.  A book can be ``included'' into an ACL2 session to extend the
data base.  This is the standard way users exchange useful sets of theorems.
See the online documentation topic BOOKS for details.
<P>
The standard distribution of ACL2 comes with many books.  They are stored on
this directory.  This is a guide to the available books.  We include
instructions on how to certify the books in this directory at the <A
HREF="#CertificationInstructions">end</A> of this note.
<P>
Some of the links below are to files.  Others are to directories.  When
you visit a directory, look at its <CODE>README</CODE> file.  Most of
these books were written by ACL2 users other than the authors of ACL2.
Authorship is acknowledged in the individual files.

<P>
If you seek a book you suspect someone might have created but which is not
here, join the ACL2 mailing list and ask the community.
<P>
If you develop a book you think will be useful to the community, please submit
it following the <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/books/index.html">instructions
for contributing books to ACL2</a>.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="CertificationInstructions">Certification Instructions</A></H2>

Instructions for certifying the ACL2 community books may be found in
the folllowing ACL2 documentation topic: <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/current/combined-manual/?topic=ACL2____BOOKS-CERTIFICATION">BOOKS-CERTIFICATION</a>.

<p>

If you obtained your books from a gzipped tarfile (typically
named <code>books-*.tar.gz</code>), as opposed to svn, then you don't
yet have the workshops books.  If you want them, simply
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/acl2-books/downloads/">download
workshops.tar.gz</a> to your acl2-sources/books/ directory</a>, and
then gunzip and extract it there.
