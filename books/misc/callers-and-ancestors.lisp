; This book provides utilities to answer the following queries (as requested by
; Warren Hunt) for a given function, fn.  BUT NOTE the following catches:
; encapsulated functions and built-in :program mode functions are all treated
; as primitives, i.e., as not calling any functions; and, attachments (see :DOC
; defattach) are not tracked.  We can probably do better than that if asked,
; though it's a little more work.

; Note that (build-immediate-callers-table state) need only be called whenever
; a relevant function's definition has been added or changed.

;  1.  Return a list of all functions that may be directly called by a
;      function.

; (immediate-ancestors fn state)

;  2.  Return a list of all functions, recursively to ACL2 primitives,
;      that may be called when a given function is called.

; (all-ancestors fn state)

;  3.  Find all functions that may directly call a defined function.

; (build-immediate-callers-table state)
; (immediate-callers fn state)

;  4.  Find all functions that may eventually call a function?

; (build-immediate-callers-table state)
