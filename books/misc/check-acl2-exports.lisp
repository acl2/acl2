; This book does a check to see if any obvious symbols are missing from
; *acl2-exports*.  The idea is that a documented symbol in the "ACL2"
; package, even if imported into the "ACL2" package, should be in
; *acl2-exports* if it has a 'const, 'formals, or 'macro-body property.
; -- unless it's explicitly excluded by virtue of belonging to the constant
; *acl2-exports-exclusions* defined in this book.
