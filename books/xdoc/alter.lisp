;; Idea:
;;   (without-xdoc (defun foo ...)
;;                 (defxdoc bar...)
;;                 (defxdoc baz ...)
;;                 (defun gah ...))
;;
;; should act like:
;;   (defun foo ...)
;;   (defun gah ...)
;;
;; Implementation: save the xdoc table aside at the start, do all the forms,
;; then smash the xdoc table with whatever we've saved.  This nicely stays
;; make-event free and doesn't, e.g., smash the xdoc table in any kind of
;; permanent or include-book hostile way.
;;
;; By treating the backups as a stack, we can even get this stuff to be
;; properly nestable.
