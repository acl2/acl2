(defun acl2::colon-xdoc-initialized (state)

; This interface function was added by Matt K. so that the proof-builder can
; determine if xdoc is ready to go.  If we only use the ld-keyword-aliases to
; determine that xdoc is available, then events will be submitted when xdoc is
; invoked from within the proof-builder (see colon-xdoc-init).  This would
; cause a weird complaint about make-event when exiting the proof-builder.

; In general, it seems best only to submit events at the top-level of the ACL2
; loop, so that ACL2 can handle them properly, for example laying down
; command-markers appropriately.  This interface function can be used by other
; applications (besides the proof-builder) in order to avoid calling xdoc when
; this would create events.

; This function is in the ACL2 package so that it can be run even when the
; "XDOC" package is not present.

;; Note about the importance of REMOVE-EQUAL-WITH-HINT.  At one point
;; doc/top.lisp was taking upwards of 30 minutes to certify.  The culprit
;; turned out to be all the uses of xdoc-prepend in std::define, each of which
;; was duplicating the entire list of xdoc topics due to its use of
;; REMOVE-EQUAL.  Since the ACL2 world stores the whole history of such table
;; events, it therefore grew to include many copies of this list, totaling ~300
;; million conses.  Since most uses of xdoc-prepend are replacing just the most
;; recently added element of the table, using remove-equal-with-hint saves
;; almost all of this consing.  (Similarly for xdoc-extend and order-subtopics,
;; though these were less common.)
