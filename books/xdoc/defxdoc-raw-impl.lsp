  :long "<p>@('Defxdoc-raw') allows you to document raw-lisp code with XDOC.
It isn't possible to do this with the ordinary @(see defxdoc) command because
@('defxdoc') is a macro that expands to a @('make-event'), and @('make-event')
is not permitted in raw Lisp.</p>

<p>@('Defxdoc-raw') is not available just by including @('xdoc/top'), because
it requires a ttag.  So, to use it you will need:</p>

@({
 (include-book \"xdoc/defxdoc-raw\" :dir :system)
})

<p>@('Defxdoc-raw') takes the same arguments as @(see defxdoc), but adds its
documentation to a Lisp variable rather than to the XDOC table.  Note that the
@(':xdoc') and @(see save) commands already know about this table, so to the
end-user, documentation added by @('defxdoc-raw') is not any different than
documentation added by @('defxdoc').</p>")
