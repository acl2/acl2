                           License Information


Scope of this LICENSE file:

   An XDOC manual has both Viewer Files for displaying topics and Content Files
   that store the actual topic data.  This LICENSE file describes the copyright
   and licensing of the Viewer Files, only.

   The topics in Content Files, such as xindex.js, xdata.js, and (in some
   cases) xdata.db, are usually derived from ACL2 books and/or other source
   code files.  These topics are typically subject to their own copyright and
   licensing terms, which are beyond the scope of this LICENSE.

   Files in the res/ directory, if one exists, are Content Files that are not
   covered by this license.
