However, instead of acting on the new xdoc topics that are created by some set
of local events, it acts on all existing topics that fit some matching
criterion.</p>

<p>Usage: @('<term>') must be a term that uses a variable named X (in any
package); it may also use @('acl2::world') and @('acl2::state').  The following
form preprocesses all existing xdoc topics for which term returns
true (non-NIL) when the topic is bound to X and the current acl2 world and
state are bound to world and state, respectively.</p>
@({
 (archive-matching-topics <term>)

<p>Thus the following could be put in a book that, when included, loads all the
documentation from @('std/strings') but does not load the actual functions and
events from there:</p>

@({
 (include-book \"xdoc/archive-matching-topics\" :dir :system)
 (local (include-book \"std/strings/top\" :dir :system))

 (archive-matching-topics (str::strprefixp \"[books]/std/strings/\" (cdr (assoc :from x))))
 })

<p>The topics that are archived by this event may be ones that were process
assumes that at the point of saving the xdoc, the definitions referenced in
these preprocessor forms exist and the @@(`...`) forms can be evaluated.  If
the documentation loaded in the archive-xdoc form references definitions that
aren't loaded, then the preprocessing will produce xdoc-errors and leave notes
behind in the documentation saying that those definitions couldn't be
found.</p>")
