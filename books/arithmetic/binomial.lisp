;; We begin with the definition of (choose k n), which counts the
;; number of ways k items can be selected out of n distinct items.

(defun choose (k n)

;; Unfortunately, ACL2 looks at the previous definition and assumes
;; that choose is a rational number -- not necessarily integer.  So
;; our first step is to establish the fact that choose is an integer
;; function.  First we need a few simplification rules.


;; The first rule is that n!/(n-1)! is equal to n.....

(defthm factorial-n/n-1
  (implies (and (integerp n)
		(<= 1 n))
	   (equal (* (factorial n)
		     (/ (factorial (+ -1 n))))
		  n))
  :hints (("Goal" :expand ((factorial n)))))

;; A more powerful rule is that n!*x/(n-1)! is equan to n*x.

		      x)
		   (* n x)))))

;; Now, we can prove the following lemma, which was suggested to us by
;; Matt Kaufmann (thanks, Matt!).  We show that the choose function
;; can be defined by a recurrence relation.  Basically, the way to
;; choose k things out of n things is to choose 1 thing and take it
;; out.  Then, if we decide to choose that item, we need to pick an
;; additional k-1 things out of n-1 things; if not, we still need to
;; pick k things out of n-1 things....  The sum of those is the number
;; we want.
