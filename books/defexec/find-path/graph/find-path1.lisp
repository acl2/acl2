; An Exercise in Graph Theory
; J Strother Moore

; This file is an ACL2 book.  To certify it, execute:
;
; (certify-book "find-path1")

; The exercise in question is to prove that a certain function
; correctly finds a path between two nodes in a directed graph, if
; such a path exists.  The article in the Case Studies book explains
; the problem and my solution in complete detail.

; This file is my first solution.  However, it has been formatted in a
; rather peculiar way to give you some clue as to how it evolved.
; First, I have added sections corresponding to the paper, to help you
; find your way around.

; More peculiarly, I have indented certain commands to show which
; commands were typed in support of others while applying The Method.
; All commands that start on the left-margin were in my initial
; script.  That is, essentially before I ever tried to prove anything
; with ACL2, I typed in the problem, the four observations, the Main
; theorem and the Spec-of-Find-Path.  (Actually, I submitted the
; defuns as I entered them in the script and debugged the definitions
; with examples.)

; Thereafter, whenever I entered a new supporting lemma while
; following The Method, I indented it three spaces further than the
; goal it was intended to support.  This gives a rather peculiar
; outline form, which nevertheless gives you a good bit of information
; about when I "discovered" what.

; Here is a made-up example of this form.  Pretend the left margin is
; where the vertical bar is shown below.

; |      (defthm A1 ...)
; |      (defthm A2 ...)
; |   (defthm A ...)
; |      (defthm B1 ...)
; |   (defthm B ...)
; |(defthm THM ...)

; Then you can deduce that I started to prove THM and discovered that
; I needed A and B.  These discoveries were made by looking at failed
; proofs of THM.  What this notation DOES NOT tell you is whether I
; discovered A and B by looking at the one failed proof of THM, or
; whether I discovered A, proved it, tried THM again, looked at
; another failed proof, and discovered B.  My style generally leads to
; the second kind of history: add one thing at a time.  But in any
; case, you can tell I proved A and B in support of THM, that I didn't
; think of them until I saw a failed proof of THM, and that I proved A
; before B.

; Not to belabor this point, but the made-up script below suggests the
; following history with The Method:

; command issued to ACL2              result

; (defthm THM ...)                    failed proof
; (defthm A ...)                      failed proof
; (defthm A1 ...)                     Q.E.D.
; (defthm A ...)                      failed proof
; (defthm A2 ...)                     Q.E.D.
; (defthm A ...)                      Q.E.D.
; (defthm THM ...)                    failed proof
; (defthm B ...)                      failed proof
; (defthm B1 ...)                     Q.E.D.
; (defthm B ...)                      Q.E.D.
; (defthm THM ...)                    Q.E.D.

; In the actual script below, there are some lemmas that having
; nothing to do with the graph problem per se, but are just nice facts
; about list processing functions.  I have marked those with comments.
; Once I proved Spec-of-Find-Path, I moved those lemmas into a
; separate book, helpers, and named the remainder of this file
; find-path2.

   ; The first submission of Crux via The Method gave rise to
   ; Crux-cdr.  Once I proved that, I submitted Crux again, of course.
   ; The Method dictates paying special attention to the first
   ; unproved subgoal that is stable under simplification.  But in
   ; that next submission of Crux, that unproved subgoal was actually
   ; proved by the subsequent destructor elimination.  The same thing
   ; happened with several subsequent stable subgoals.  Basically,
   ; elim is being used in this proof to identify p with (list (car
   ; p)) when p is a singleton, and to identify p with (cons (car c)
   ; (cdr p)) when (car c) is (car p).  So I accepted destructor
   ; elimination as a key technique in the proof and stopped looking
   ; at the first stable subgoal.  Instead, I started scanning for the
   ; next checkpoints, e.g., generalizations.  That led me to the
   ; sequence of list processing lemmas between here and Crux-cdr
