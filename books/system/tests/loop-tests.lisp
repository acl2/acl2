; The Boohoo Problem

; Note that x is known to satisfy true-listp and rattail satisfies rational-listp.

;               (true-listp (append a b))))

; which in fact we can.  But the guard verification of boohoo fails with the
; following checkpoint.

               (<= (CAR (CADR NEWV)) 7))
          (TRUE-LISTP (APPEND (CAR NEWV) (CADR NEWV)))))

; To prove this with our machinery we need to rely on fancy-uqi-true-list-2.
; All the uqi rules target the (member-equal ...) and contain the negation of
; the type property of the appropriate element of newv as a hyp.  In the case
; of fancy-uqi-true-list-2 the relevant hyp is

; (not (true-listp (cadr newv)))

; We expect to relieve this hyp of fancy-uqi-true-list-2 using the negation of
; of the guard conjecture conclusion, which in this case is:

; (not (TRUE-LISTP (APPEND (CAR NEWV) (CADR NEWV))))

; So either we need to have rewritten that concl as per
; true-listp-append-rewrite, or we need

(defthm boohoo-lemma
