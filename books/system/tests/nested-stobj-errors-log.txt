Perhaps we can prove *1 by induction.  Three induction schemes are
suggested by this conjecture.  Subsumption reduces that number to two.
One of these has a score higher than the other.  

We will induct according to a scheme suggested by (LEN ST6).  This
suggestion was produced using the :induction rules LEN and TRUE-LISTP.
If we let (:P KEY ST5 ST6) denote *1 above then the induction scheme
we'll use is
(AND (IMPLIES (NOT (CONSP ST6))
              (:P KEY ST5 ST6))
     (IMPLIES (AND (CONSP ST6) (:P KEY ST5 (CDR ST6)))
              (:P KEY ST5 ST6))).
This induction is justified by the same argument used to admit LEN.
When applied to the goal at hand the above induction scheme produces
four nontautological subgoals.
