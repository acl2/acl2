; acl2-doc-wrap.lisp
;
; This is a trivial wrapper for acl2-doc.lisp.  We:
;
;   - Reset the :from information so that each topic thinks it's from the "ACL2
;     sources" instead of from acl2-doc.lisp.
;
;   - Use make-event to save the whole documentation database into a single
;     constant, so we can just slurp in the thing instead of having to process
;     1500 defxdoc forms at include-book time.
;
; This seems very nice: on one machine at Centaur, we can include-book
; acl2-doc-wrap.lisp in 0.58 seconds, whereas using include-book on
; acl2-doc.lisp takes 2.02 seconds (each of these seem consistent).
