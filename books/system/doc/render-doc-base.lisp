; The following comment was an attempt by Matt K. to deal with a new topic name
; that contained the square-bracket character: SV::4VEC-[= .  That name was
; breaking the acl2-doc Emacs browser.  My thought was to escape the square
; bracket, "...\[..."; but that got messy to handle for both Common Lisp and
; Emacs Lisp, perhaps in particular because Common Lisp was escaping the "\",
; and "\\[" didn't help Emacs.  So I'm taking the easy way out instead, simply
; replacing [ and ] by { and }, respectively.  I'm not happy that
; rendered-name-acl2-doc already replaces ( and ) by those characters, but {
; and } seem less likely to cause confusion; in particular, there are topics
; SV::4VEC-< and SV::4VEC-[= that don't seem much related, so it would be sad
; to convert the latter to SV::4VEC-<=.  I may revisit this solution in the
; future; Jared has suggested a possible path to a solution.  For now, since
; there is only one affected topic, I can live with the simple replacement.
