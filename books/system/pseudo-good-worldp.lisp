; -----------------------------------------------------------------

; This file defines the concept of a ``good world''.  But we wrestled with the
; question of how strong it should be.  Ultimately what we define is the
; concept pseudo-good-worldp.  This is a relatively weak approximation of the
; invariants we assume in the ACL2 system code.  (For example, this file checks
; pseudo-termp for some parts of the world where termp is actually assumed, and
; there are unchecked invariants assumed between components stored under
; separate properties, e.g., pseudo-good-worldp does not check that the
; ``equivalence relations'' stored in congruence rules are in fact known
; equivalence relations.)  Failure of the actual world to satisfy these
; unchecked assumptions could easily cause unsoundness or lead to hard errors.
; Pseudo-good-worldp is both a combination of obvious shallow invariants we
; assume plus properties required to do the proofs so far undertaken about
; system code.  It will evolve under the demands of further proofs about system
; functions and is liable to become more restrictive as more system properties.
; Every world "should" satisfy this predicate, though we are aware of worlds
; created using trust tags that fail to do so, in particular using community
; books in directories hacking/ and workshops/2007/dillinger-et-al/code/.  In
; practice those worlds might well be usable, but we should not be surprised
; when pseudo-good-worldp fails for such worlds.

; But in the following discussion we talk about the undefined more generic
; notion ``good-worldp'' and its various possible meanings.

; Good-worldp will be used in theorems about system functions that take the
; world, w, as an argument.  In most of the discussion that follows we pretend
; that all we care about is whether the elements of the world are ``terms''.  In
; truth, we are interested in all sorts of other data structures in the world
; like runes, numes, enabled structures, event indices, arities, formals, etc.
; But the ``term'' question is sufficient to motivate the basic questions.

; Recall that we currently have two senses of being a ``term'', pseudo-termp and
; termp.  The former just checks crude shape and type of each component.  The
; latter takes a world and does a thorough check on arities and the legality of
; various symbols.  Of interest here is that if a ``function symbol'' is obtained
; from a termp of w, then (a) the arity of that function symbol is a natural
; number and (b) every call of that function symbol in any termp of w has that
; number of arguments.

; Let's consider the proof of three different kinds of system properties that
; would involve good-worldp in their formalization: guard verification,
; correctness of theorem proving code, and world-modifying system functions.

; For guard verification, the most shallow notion of ``term'', pseudo-termp, is
; usually sufficient.  There will be a few examples where this is insufficient
; even for guard verification: if all you know about term is that it is a
; pseudo-termp and that it has a top function symbol, then (ffn-symb term)
; might have a non-numeric arity, which would cause a guard violation.  We
; suspect that any system function calling arity will need to know the stronger
; invariant about w.

; For proof of correctness-level properties of system functions, we almost
; certainly need the termp sense of well-formedness.  For example, if two calls
; of the function symbol fn have different numbers of arguments, then
; one-way-unify would not return a substitution that made them the same, even
; though it might report that it did.

; Finally, for some proofs of system-level properties, we need a STILL stronger
; sense of well-formed worlds.  Consider a function that takes a world w and
; rolls us back to an earlier world, w', at some COMMAND-LANDMARK.  We need to
; prove (good-worldp w) --> (good-worldp w').  But now good-world must insure
; that every term in w is a termp with respect to the then-current world.  This
; ``super-strong'' sense of good-worldp uses termp but repeatly resets the
; relevant world to that current at the moment the relevant triple was stored.

; Here we define just one version of good-worldp, pseudo-good-worldp, which is
; designed to be suitable for most guard verification of functions taking world
; as an arg.  Of course, the proof is in the proofs, which will undoubtedly
; turn up ommissions from what is done initially.  Furthermore, our
; anticipation of necessary guard properties is guided by trying to imagine
; that functions alleged to return terms in fact return pseudo-terms.  So our
; initial characterization of properties not directly related to term formation
; is sketchy at best.

; This whole discussion obscures a fact that becomes overwhelmingly obvious
; once you get into the definition of pseudo-good-worldp: there is no end to
; checks one could insist on in the strong sense.  For example, EVENT-LANDMARKs
; include a field that lists the ``names introduced.''  In the weak sense, that
; requirement is formalized by insisting the field is a list of symbols and/or
; strings.  In the strong sense, every element in the list ought to actually be
; a name in w.  Or maybe, in addition, each ought to be a name actually introduced
; within the current event block.  Or maybe, in addition, strings appear only
; if they are package names.  Or maybe, ...

; A much better example is the QUICK-BLOCK-INFO property.  It had better be in
; 1:1 correspondence with the FORMALS; indeed, it need only be found on the
; property list of recursive functions and better be on each recursive
; function.  And it had better accurately reflect some measure controlling the
; recursion.  It's not enough just to be a list of the appropriate symbols --
; as we check here!  The invariants between our various triples are too
; numerous to check until it's time to do proofs requiring them.

; Rather than try to anticipate all such strong interpretations we are going to
; wait until proofs of interest necessitate their identification.

; A minor consideration:  The requirement on some properties is that they are
; Boolean valued.  However, we tend not to store NIL properties and so it is
; highly likely that any property with a BOOLEANP requirement would pass
; if the requirement were replaced by (eq val T).

; Converting System Functions to Logic Mode

; Since the functions here will be used in guards, they need to be
; guard-verified.

(logic)
(set-verify-guards-eagerness 2)

; -----------------------------------------------------------------

; We now consider each property in a good world and define a function to
; recognize (in the ``pseudo'' sense) good values.  We start with the property
; GLOBAL-VALUE and enumerate each of the symbols that can have this property
; and what the value must be.

; -----------------------------------------------------------------
; EVENT-INDEX [GLOBAL-VALUE]:

; (event-indexp x w) checks whether x is the legal GLOBAL-VALUE for EVENT-INDEX
; for the world w.

; The appropriate GLOBAL-VALUE for EVENT-INDEX is a cons whose car is some
; natural number n and whose cdr, wlst, is a list of length n+1.  Furthermore,
; the ith element of wlst, is a tail of w and the GLOBAL-VALUE of
; EVENT-LANDMARK in that tail has an access-event-tuple-number that is (* (- n
; i) *event-index-interval*).

; Note that one implication of this is that the global-value of event-landmark
; in w must be a multiple of *event-index-interval*; this follows from the case
; for i=0.

; REDUNDANCY-BUNDLE

; The structure of a redundancy-bundle of a stobj is actually pretty
; unimportant.  They are only used as fingerprints of a defstobj event,
; allowing us to recognize a redundant event.  It is not clear that internal
; structure matters at all!  However, before realizing this we had defined the
; following pseudo recognizer for redundancy-bundles and so have left it in
; place.

; The redundancy-bundle of a stobj is computed by defstobj-redundancy-bundle
; and is of the form (field-descriptors . renaming-alist), where
; field-descriptors is the list of field descriptors from a legal defstobj
; event

;         (fieldi :type typei :initially vali :resizable bi)

; where each fieldi is a symbol, each typei is either a type-spec or (ARRAY
; type-spec (max)), each vali is an object satisfying typei, and each bi is
; Boolean.  Any and all of the keyword pairs may be omitted or presented in any
; order and (fieldi) may be shortened to fieldi.  The renaming-alist is a
; symbol-to-symbol doublet-style alist.  But CLTL type language is sufficiently
; complicated that we do not check here that typei is well-formed nor that vali
; satisfies it.  To do better, we should admit translate-declaration-to-guard1
; into the logic.

; *ACL2-property-unbound*

; In this section I discuss *acl2-property-unbound*.  This property value
; caused me grief in the initial attempts to formalize the event-index property
; I proved.  So I investigated that property value and here record some
; important findings, only one of which is reflected in the definition of
; good-worldp below.

; At first I thought I might cope with *acl2-property-unbound* by ``cleansing''
; the world of it before checking good-worldp: wiping out any shadowed property
; values.  But if the world has been cleansed, then the worlds I find in the
; event indices are not tails of it!  Furthermore, cleansing them will not
; produce tails!

; Shadowing ``on the fly'' is probably the way to go.  That is what our own
; code does, as with actual-props and new-trips.  If this issue becomes
; critical, I'd recommend taking the view that a world is really a pair
; consisting of a list of triples and some shadowing, the latter being a list
; of symbol-property pairs that are now unbound.  That is essentially our
; definitional style in the code, when we can't just ignore the issue locally.

; Here are some observations about the unbound property, confirmed by
; code-walks.  These might be useful in future additions to good-worldp or in
; proofs.

; *ACL2-property-unbound* is only stored by renew-name.  One argument to that
; function is renewal-mode, which must be :erase, :overwrite or
; :reclassifying-overwrite), The only time :reclassifying-overwrite is the
; renewal-mode is when a :program function is being reclassified to an
; identical-defp :logic function.

; When a name has been redefined for any reason, a REDEFINED property is stored.

; Renew-name is called only by chk-redefineable-namep.  That function takes a
; reclassifyingp flag.  If reclassifyingp is non-nil and not a consp message
; (see redundant-or-reclassifying-defunp) then we know that in fact this new
; definition is just a conversion of the existing definition.

; Chk-redefineable-namep is called only by chk-just-new-name.

; chk-just-new-name is called by every event function.  The reclassifyingp
; argument is always nil except in chk-acceptable-defuns1.
; The value there is set by redundant-or-reclassifying-defunsp

; Conclusion: I believe it is safe to assume that, unless redefinition has been
; permitted, the only time we'll see *acl2-property-unbound* in a legal world
; is when it is part of the reclassifying of a :program mode function to :logic
; mode.

; It then becomes relevant to ask what properties might become unbound in a
; legal world?

; Renew-name will not unbind any GLOBAL-VALUE and cites explitly the bad
; consequences of messing with COMMAND-LANDMARKs.  So we can rule out unbound
; being a value of EVENT-INDEX (and all other world globals) ``locally'' in
; good-worldp.

; One might think (naively after 8 years absence) that there are no unbound
; properties in the bootstrap world.  Wrong.

; I think that the only ACL2 properties that are ever unbound in a good world
; (barring use of :REDEF) are those in the list below.  These come from
; verify-termination or verify-guards or the bootstrap process itself.

; This code, executed in raw Lisp, will print the unbound properties of the world,
; other than those explicitly identified below.  The comments interspersed in
; the list of properties below explain how it is these properties come to be
; unbound in the V3.6.1 bootstrap world.

; FYI: If you count the event-landmarks between the event-indices (or
; analogously for commands), you get a sequence like this: (8 10 10 10 ... 10
; 10 1 1).  The 10 is the *event-index-interval*.  The 8 in this example is, in
; general, some natural number less than the interval.  The two 1's at the very
; end require some explaining!  The last 1 (the one that was stored
; chronologically first) is the assignment of -1 to event-landmark global-value
; in primordial-world-globals.  Also in primordial-world-globals, and after the
; assignment of event-landmark, we initialize event-index to nil.  So that
; creates a world like this: ((EVENT-INDEX global-value . nil) ...
; (EVENT-LANDMARK global-value . (-1 ...))  ...)  At this point the
; absolute-event-number is -1.  The first official event we carry out is
; ENTER-BOOT-STRAP-MODE, which gets event number 0.  Since that is a multiple
; of the event index interval, we lay down another EVENT-INDEX, containing just
; one event landmark.  So that EVENT-INDEX triple is: (EVENT-INDEX global-value
; . (0 (....))).  That 0 is the marker that says we've reached the primordial
; world.

; We know from event-indexp that the current event-landmark at every non-empty
; event-index is a multiple of *event-index-interval*.  We know from
; sequential-event-landmarksp that the landmarks are sequential, starting from
; -1.  Thus, I believe the periodic pattern of indices can be deduced and do
; not specify it.
