; Many thanks to ForrestHunt, Inc. for supporting the preponderance of this
; work, and for permission to include it here.

; See the Refresher on books/system/, etc. in books/system/apply/apply-prim for
; some background.

; One way to think of this book is that it was derived by taking its source
; file counterpart, e.g., apply-constraints.lisp, and sprinkling in the
; include-books, defthms, declarations, and hints to get the source file
; admitted in guard-verified, :logic mode fashion by a version of ACL2 in
; which these functions weren't already defined.  We supply minimal comments
; here except when discussing the termination/guard verification issues.  See
; the corresponding source files for explanations of the definitions below!
