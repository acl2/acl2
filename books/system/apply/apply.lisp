; See the Refresher on books/system/, etc. in books/system/apply/apply-prim for
; some background.

; One way to think of this book is that it was derived by taking its source
; file counterpart, e.g., apply.lisp, and sprinkling in the include-books,
; defthms, declarations, and hints to get the source file admitted in
; guard-verified, :logic mode fashion by a version of ACL2 in which these
; functions weren't already defined.  We supply minimal comments here except
; when discussing the termination/guard verification issues.  See the
; corresponding source files for explanations of the definitions below!

; (b) Every function called in body has a badge (including fn if we consider
;     new-badge the badge of fn).

; (c) Every subterm of body with occurrence ilk :FN is:
;     a formal variable of fn with ilk :FN in new-badge, or
;     a quoted tame function symbol other than fn, or
;     a quoted, well-formed (fully translated and closed), tame lambda
;     expression that does not call fn.

; (d) Every subterm of body with occurrence ilk :EXPR is:
;     a formal variable of fn with ilk :EXPR in new-badge, or
;     a quoted, well-formed (fully translated), tame term that does not call
;     fn.

; (e) If the nth formal, vn, of fn has ilk :FN or :EXPR then vn is passed
;     unchanged into the nth slot of every recursive call of fn.

; Since we rely on our assurances to build the model, and since the assurances
; are phrased as above but checked as below, and since our proof actually

; 7. Functional Equivalence

; We now develop the notion of two functions being equivalent.  The basic idea
; is that fn1 is functionally equivalent to fn2 if they are both tame and
; apply$ cannot distinguish them.  We define fn-equal to be this concept, but
; first need the quantified statement that apply$ cannot distinguish the two.

(defun-sk apply$-equivalence (fn1 fn2)
  (declare (xargs :guard t))
  (forall (args)
    (equal (ec-call (apply$ fn1 args))
           (ec-call (apply$ fn2 args)))))

(defun fn-equal (fn1 fn2)
  (declare (xargs :guard t))
  (if (equal fn1 fn2)
      t
      (and (tamep-functionp fn1)
           (tamep-functionp fn2)
           (apply$-equivalence fn1 fn2))))

(local
 (defthm apply$-equivalence-necc-rewriter
   (implies (equal (apply$ fn1 (apply$-equivalence-witness fn1 fn2))
                   (apply$ fn2 (apply$-equivalence-witness fn1 fn2)))
            (equal (apply$ fn1 args)
                   (apply$ fn2 args)))
   :hints (("Goal" :in-theory (disable APPLY$-EQUIVALENCE-NECC)
            :use APPLY$-EQUIVALENCE-NECC))))

(defequiv fn-equal)

(defcong fn-equal equal (apply$ fn args) 1)

(in-theory (disable fn-equal))

; Every time a mapping function is introduced we also prove the fn-equal
; congruence rule.  Here is how we generate it.  For example,

; (generate-fn-equal-congruences '(collect lst fn) 1 '(nil :fn))

; produces the list containing just

; (defcong fn-equal equal (collect lst fn) 2)

(defun defcong-fn-equal-equal-events (term i c1-cn)
  (declare (xargs :guard (and (natp i)
                              (true-listp c1-cn))))
  (cond
   ((endp c1-cn) nil)
   ((eq (car c1-cn) :FN)
    (cons `(defcong fn-equal equal ,term ,i
             :hints
             (("Goal" :in-theory (disable (:executable-counterpart force)))))
          (defcong-fn-equal-equal-events term (+ 1 i) (cdr c1-cn))))
