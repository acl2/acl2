; Refresher on books/system/, etc.

; The books on books/system/ are critical to the construction of the released
; version of ACL2 because they address certain bootstrapping problems.  See the
; discussion of *system-verify-guards-alist* in boot-strap-pass-2-b.lisp.  But,
; roughly put, during bootstrapping some functions cannot be admitted in logic
; mode or cannot have their guards verified because the requisite logical
; machinery (e.g., lexicographic relations) does not exist yet.  Such functions
; are therefore admitted initially in :PROGRAM mode and then magically upgraded
; to guard-verified :LOGIC mode at the very end of the bootstrapping process.
; The books on books/system/ address the question ``Is the magic right?''

; The books address that question by introducing the definitions of the
; relevant functions, identical to the definitions in the source code but in
; :logic mode and with appropriate :measures and :guards, and availing
; themselves of all the normal events of ACL2 (including the inclusion of of
; distributed books) to verify termination and guards.  The build process we
; follow before an ACL2 release stipulates that we build an intermediate ACL2
; image with the :acl2-devel feature on (where the problematic functions are
; left in :program mode) and then use that image to certify the books/system/
; books and the cone of books supporting it.  The process also confirms that
; the data stored in *system-verify-guards-alist* is correct wrt to the
; certified books/system/ books, thus insuring that the assumption of those
; facts by the normal build is probably ok.  We say probably here because there
; is, perhaps, still room for circularity but we are just using ``best
; practice'' to assure ourselves that our claims are true.

; Turning to the books/system/apply/ books specifically, they are concerned
; with apply$ and its supporters.  See the Essay on the APPLY$ Integration for
; some background.

; One way to think of each of these books is that it was derived by taking its
; source file counterpart, e.g., apply-prim.lisp in the case of this book,
; books/system/apply/apply-prim, and sprinkling in the include-books, defthms,
; declarations, and hints to get the source file admitted in guard-verified,
; :logic mode fashion by a version of ACL2 in which these functions weren't
; already defined.  But, historically, it happened the other way: apply$ wasn't
; in ACL2 Version_7.4, it was introduced in a collection of certified books,
; and then we stripped out of those books everything but the definitions, which
; we moved into the ACL2 sources for Version_8.0.  These books are therefore
; more aptly described as the ``original'' books admitting apply$, et al.

; We supply minimal comments here except when discussing the termination/guard
; verification issues.  See the corresponding source files for explanations of
; the definitions below!

; Historical Note: Prior to integration of apply$ into the sources, each of
; these books introducing the logical definitions supporting apply$ carried a
; warning not to edit the file except the version found on
; books/projects/apply-model.  That warning was appropriate because we wanted
; the distributed apply books in the Community Books to exactly match the
; foundational books showing that models can be built.  But now apply$ is in
; the sources, we regard the foundational work as static (supporting the paper
; and justifying the basic approach to apply$), and we are free (under the
; usual soundness caveats) to improve apply$ going forward, we no longer insist
; that these files exactly match the foundational work on apply$.

(local (in-theory (enable apply$-primp badge-prim)))

; We now prove that badge-prim returns either nil or a badge of the form
; (APPLY$-BADGE flg arity . T).  This would be trivial except for the fact that
; there are so many cases (because the alist is so long).  So we resort to a
; standard trick for proving something about a big constant: define a function,
; named check-it! below, to check the property computationally, prove that the
; property holds of x if (check-it x) is t, then derive the main theorem by
; instantiating that lemma with {x <-- '<big-constant>}.

; stack size of 1000.  For example, we cannot prove: (thm (equal (apply$-prim

; stack and verify a metafunction which will enable MUCH faster reduction of
; (apply$-prim 'fn args), and then disable apply$-prim.  We also disable
; apply$-primp, leaving only the executable-counterpart enabled to resolve the
; question of whether a given quoted symbol is a primitive.
