; This just proves that EXTEND-PATHNAME terminates.  It doesn't look like we
; can verify its guards, because functions it calls don't have appropriate
; guards, e.g., remove-after-last-directory-separator obviously expects its
; argument to be a string but doesn't have any type/guard declaration for that.
