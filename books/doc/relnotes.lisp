; (Matt K.: Not sure this deserves explicit mention, so I'll make it a comment.
; If someone prefers to move it into the :long string, that's fine with me.)  A
; simple fix for the acl2-doc Emacs browser allows handling of topics with
; square brackets.  This fix was necessary because the new topic,
; "SV::4VEC-[=", broke acl2-doc; it wouldn't initialize.  The fix simply
; replaces characters #\[ and #\] with #\< and #\>, respectively.  It's not a
; perfect fix, but it seems awkward to try to escape #\[ (which Emacs Lisp
; thinks starts a vector).  See system/doc/render-doc-base.lisp.

 <h3>Deleted Books and Stubs</h3>

 <p>When we move a book, we often add a <b>stub</b> book in its previous
 location to help you transition your @(see include-book) commands.  The @(see
 build::cert.pl) build system prints warnings when a stub book is being
 included.  Stub books have a lifespan of one release.  The following books
 were stubs in ACL2 7.0, so we've deleted them.</p>

 @({
     Previous Location                          Replacement
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     centaur/vl/mlib/context                    centaur/vl/parsetree
     centaur/vl/util/toposort                   centaur/depgraph/toposort

     tools/defredundant                         std/util/defredundant
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 })

 <p>The directory @('fix-cert/') has been deleted, as it is no longer necessary
 now that it is possible to move the system books directory after certifying
 its books (see @(see note-7-1)).</p>

 <p>The directory @('regex/') has been moved to @('projects/regex/').</p>


 <h3>New Libraries and Documentation</h3>

 <p>David Russinoff has contributed a new version of the rtl library:
 @('rtl/rel10/').  This time the new version depends on a previous version,
 namely, @('rtl/rel9/').  The new @('rtl/rel10/') library has, in turn, been
 adapted to reside in a new @('\"RTL\"') package; the result is
 @('rtl/rel11/').</p>

 <p>Marijn Heule's @('drat-trim') tool, for checking SAT solver proofs, is now
 available in @('tools/drat-trim').</p>

 <p>Matt Kaufmann and Cuong Chau have formalized the overspill property in
 ACL2(r), see @('nonstd/nsa/overspill.lisp').</p>

 <p>The new @('clause-processors/induction') book demonstrates a (not very
 practical) clause processor that does induction.</p>

 <p>The new directory @('projects/fifo') has a list-based FIFO implementation,
 that has some properties proven about it.</p>

 <p>The new book @('books/tools/include-an-arithmetic-book.lisp') provides
 short-hand includes of the arithmetic libraries, including various
 configurations of @('arithmetic-5').</p>

 <p>The @('misc/assert') book is now documented; see for instance @(see
 assert!).</p>

 <p>The documentation for @(see data-structures) is now included in the manual;
 previously it was excluded because of name conflicts with other libraries, but
 these have now been resolved.</p>

 <h3>Name Changes</h3>

 <p>As mentioned above, the newest @(see rtl) library is now in an @('RTL')
 package.</p>

 <p>The @(see bitops) library is now in a new @('BITOPS') package.  See below
 (under ``bitops'') for more information and suggestions about porting books.</p>

 <p>Renamed @('remove-keywords') to @('remove-any-keywords') in
 @('coi/nary/nary.lisp') to avoid a name conflict between the @('coi') and
 @('ccg') books; also updated the @('nary') workshop books.</p>


 <h3>@(see std)</h3>

 <p>The @(see b*) book has moved from @('tools/bstar') to @('std/util/bstar').
 There is a stub in the previous location.  As a special compatibility measure,
 this stub will be kept available for two releases.</p>

 <p>Added new @(see print-legibly) and @(see print-compressed) functions to
 @(see std/io).  These can print to @(':object') channels with or without @(see
 serialize)-style compression, and have the necessary theorems about state and
 output-channel preservation.</p>

 <p>There is new syntactic sugar based on @(see define)'s named return values.
 The new @(see defret) macro offers a more comfortable syntax for proving
 theorems about return values by their name.  Also, the new <see topic='@(url
 patbind-ret)'>ret</see> binder for @(see b*) allows you to name the bundled
 return values from a @(see define) and then access individual components using
 a C-like or @(see std::defaggregate)/@(see fty::defprod)-like @('.') syntax.</p>

 <p>The @(see define) macro now checks the arity of @(':returns') specifiers
 when possible.</p>

 <p>Some @('std/lists') books have been tweaked:</p>

 <ul>

 <li>The @(see acl2-count) book now provides stronger rules.</li>

 <li>The @('equal-sets') book now includes the lemma
 @('set-equiv-of-nil').</li>

 <li>The @('append') book now includes a few rules about (ca/dr (append ...))
 to std/lists.  (Two of the new rules are disabled, and there's a theory
 invariant to make sure things stay reasonable.)</li>

 <li>The @('duplicity') book now have stronger theorems relating @(see
 duplicity) to @(see member-equal).</li>

 </ul>


 <h3>@(see oslib)</h3>

 <p>Added a new @(see oslib::universal-time) function.</p>

 <p>Fixed a raw lisp bug with the definition of @9see oslib::ls), and added a
 regression test.</p>

 <p>Fixed minor bugs with @(see oslib::copy).</p>


 <h3>@(see bitops)</h3>

 <p>Bitops is now in a package.  To minimize backwards incompatibility, the new
 package imports a lot of stuff that you might not expect.  For instance all of
 the @(see logops-definitions), and their recursive @('**') variants are still
 found in the ACL2 package, as are most of the bitops rulesets, its new
 function definitions, and many frequently instantiated theorems.  When
 updating your books, you may find it convenient to import
 @('*bitops-exports*') into packages that use bitops functions.</p>

 <p>Extended the @(see bitops::bitops/merge) book with several new 256- and
 512-bit merges, @(see bitops::merge-8-u2s), and improved its
 documentation.</p>

 <p>Added @(see nth-slice128).</p>


 <h3>@(see fty::fty)</h3>

 <p>The case macros from @(see fty::defflexsum) and @(see fty::deftranssum) now
 require a variable, and cannot bind that variable itself, because the syntax
 for doing so was too weird and unintuitive.  They can now also be used to
 carry out type-checks, e.g., @('(foo-case x :mytag)') now returns true when
 @('x') has tag @(':mytag').</p>

 <p>The macros @('defoption') and @('deftranssum') macros, formerly part of
 @(see vl), are now integrated into the @(see fty::deftypes) framework.</p>


 <h3>@(see xdoc)</h3>

 <p>The fancy viewer's jump-to box should perform better.  It now suggest exact
 name matches first and otherwise shows results in importance order, instead of
 alphabetical order, which may be better when there are many matches.</p>

 <p>The fancy viewer now features a mobile-friendly version with many features.
 This should greatly improve access to ACL2 documentation at parties, sporting
 events, and other social occasions.</p>

 <p>Fixed a bug with @('<em>') tag handling that affected the @(':xdoc')
 command and Emacs-based @(see acl2-doc) tool.</p>

 <p>Fixed a bug with using multiple @(see defsection) extensions with the same
 name.  Defsection now requires a non-nil symbol as the section name.</p>

 <p>As the manual has grown substantially, some memory management measures have
 been taken in @('doc/top.lisp').</p>


 <h3>@(see quicklisp)</h3>

 <p>The approach to distributing Common Lisp libraries has been updated to use
 the new <a href='http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/bundles.html'>Quicklisp
 bundles</a> feature.  Some additional Common Lisp libraries have been
 added to the bundle.</p>

 <p>The @(see tshell) library is now based on the <a
 href='https://github.com/jaredcdavis/shellpool'>Shellpool</a> Common Lisp
 library (via @(see quicklisp)).  This may improve reliability and cross-lisp
 portability for @('tshell') itself and also for libraries like @(see satlink)
 which are based on it.</p>


 <h3>@(see vl), @(see esim), and now @(see vl2014)</h3>

 <p>VL and ESIM have undergone major changes, including a fork of VL.  For
 details about these changes, see @(see note-7-1-vl).</p>


 <h3>Other Libraries</h3>

 <p>Ben Selfridge's @(see leftist-trees) library is now available under an
 MIT/X11 style license instead of the GNU General Public License.</p>

 <p>The bounding theorems for @(see logext) in @('ihs/logops-definitions') have
 been tightened.</p>

 <p>For the @(see tau-system), there is now a @(see UNARY--) bounder in
 @('tau/bounders/elementary-bounders').</p>

 <p>The @(see defsort) macro has been enhanced to better support the fixtype
 discipline of the @(see fty::fty) library.  In support of this, it now
 requires a stricter transitivity property, i.e., the comparison function must
 support unconditional transitivity, regardless of element type.  (This is
 typically easy to achieve by using @('<<') as a fallback in case of malformed
 elements.)</p>

 <p>The Codewalker demo books have been improved to use built-in function
 nat-listp and weaken the hyps (state invariant) so that the state components
 consist of integers, not naturals.</p>

 <p>@(see gl) now uses an improved theory for better @(see
 def-gl-clause-processor) event performance.</p>

 <p>The @(see template-subst) tool now has some extended repetition
 capabilities.</p>

 <p>Various other libraries have received minor cleanups.</p>


 <h3>Build System Updates</h3>

 <p>@(see build::cert.pl), et al. now tolerate @('( include-book...') instead
 of @('(include-book...'), etc.</p>

 <p>Errors during portcullis events (i.e., @('.acl2') files) should now cause
 certification to fail; many books have been updated to avoid problems that
 were, until now, just being ignored.</p>

 <p>Various updates have been made to the Jenkins scripts to keep things up to
 date.</p>

 <p>For most Lisps, @(see build::cert.pl) will now include garbage collection
 messages in output logs files.  This may occasionally be useful when debugging
 performance issues.</p>

  :parents (note-7-1-books)
  :short "Notes about changes to @(see vl) and @(see esim) in ACL2 Version
7.1."

  :long "<h3>VL Fork</h3>

 <p>There have been many changes to @(see vl) and @(see esim).  Most notably,
 VL has been forked into two versions.</p>

 <dl>
 <dt>@(see vl2014) is a ``stable'' fork of VL.</dt>
 <dd>It lives in a new directory: @('books/centaur/vl2014')</dd>
 <dd>It uses the @('VL2014') package.</dd>
 <dd>It continues to work with @(see esim) and other, older tools.</dd>
 <dd>It is no longer under active development by Centaur.</dd>

 <dt>@(see vl) continues as the ``development'' version of VL.</dt>
 <dd>It continues to live in: @('books/centaur/vl').</dd>
 <dd>It continues to use the @('VL') package.</dd>
 <dd>It <b>no longer supports @(see esim)</b>.</dd>
 <dd>It remains under active development.</dd>
 <dd>It targets a new backend (instead of esim) which is still under development.</dd>
 <dd>It may be rather unstable and not yet particularly usable.</dd>
 </dl>

 <p>The new @('vl') code base is in many cases significantly different than
 @(see vl2014).  It features a new, more strongly typed expression
 representation, generally better abstractions for working with
 scopes/hierarchy and types, and new approaches to elaboration and sizing that
 can handle much more of SystemVerilog.  More information on the motives and
 consequences of this split can be found in the documentation for @(see
 vl2014).</p>

 <p>Largely in support of this fork, many books have been reorganized.  Many
 books that are specific to the VL/ESIM flow have been moved into the ESIM
 directory:</p>

 @({
    centaur/vl/top.lisp --> centaur/vl/defmodules.lisp (with a stub)
    centaur/vl/defmodules.lisp --> centaur/esim/defmodules.lisp
    centaur/vl/translation.lisp --> centaur/esim/translation.lisp
    centaur/vl/toe --> centaur/esim/vltoe (filenames have been unsmurfed)
    centaur/vl/util/esim-lemmas.lisp --> centaur/esim/vltoe
    centaur/vl/transforms/occform/* --> centaur/esim/occform
 })

 <p>Various other files have also been moved into ESIM:</p>

 @({
    centaur/tutorial --> centaur/esim/tutorial
    centaur/vcd --> centaur/esim/vcd
    centaur/regression --> centaur/esim/tests
 })

 <p>Many other minor file-name changes have been made to help improve the
 organization of the code base.</p>

 <p>The various VL <i>flows</i> are also now better separated.  For
 instance:</p>

 <ul>

 <li>The ESIM flow no longer performs certain linter checks that are better
 handled by VL-Lint.  For instance, it no longer generates a classic
 use-set-report since the new Lucid reporting is much better.</li>

 <li>The @('vl model') command (based on the ESIM flow) is no longer used in
 the module browser.  Instead, the module browser now reads @('.vlzip') files
 that are produced by the @('vl zip') command, which is independent of
 ESIM.</li>

 </ul>


 <h3>Extended Support for Verilog/SystemVeriog</h3>

 <p>The new VL (and in some cases VL2014) now have better support for at least
 the following Verilog/SystemVerilog features:</p>

 <ul>
 <li>@('.*') connections that involve interface ports,</li>
 <li>@('return') statements in functions,</li>
 <li>@('inside') expressions like @('a inside {b, c, [d:e]}'),</li>
 <li>@('generate') constructs,</li>
 <li>System functions like @('$bits') and @('$clog2'),</li>
 <li>Unpacked dimensions in various contexts,</li>
 <li>Matched @('end : foo') style endings on blocks,</li>
 <li>Declarations on unnamed blocks,</li>
 <li>Typedefs with a single unpacked dimension, i.e., @('typedef ... foo_t [3]'),</li >
 <li>Ports whose expressions involve parameters,</li>
 <li>Scope expressions and other complex hierarchical expressions,</li>
 <li>Module level begin/end blocks (not in the spec but supported by simulators),</li >
 <li>Package imports in block statements, functions, and tasks,</li>
 <li>Certain complex assignment patterns,</li>
 <li>The @('`\"'), @('`\\`\\\"'), and @('``') escapes in @('`define') macros,</li>
 <li>Certain macro invocations in @('`include')/@('`ifdef') forms,</li>
 </ul>


 <h3>@(see vl::lint) Improvements</h3>

 <p>The loader works harder to attach parse-time warnings to the appropriate
 modules.</p>

 <p>The new @(see vl::lucid) check is a far more capable check for unused,
 unset, and multiply driven wires, with proper understanding of SystemVerilog
 scoping.  The old use-set and multidrive warnings have been retired.</p>

 <p>Heuristic improvements have been made to leftright checking,
 extension/fussy size warnings for @(''1')/@(''0')/..., and duplicate instance
 checking involving interfaces and portless modules.  Extension warning
 heuristics are also now attachable.</p>

 <p>Improved the warning messages for zero-sized replications, overflowing
 integer literals, and generally for warnings where expressions involve
 parameters after unparameterization.</p>

 <p>Portcheck now warns about stylistically undesirable ports such as
 @('foo[3:0]').</p>

 <p>There is now a basic suite of system-level tests directed at the linter;
 see the @('linttest') directory.  These tests have shed light on many minor
 linter bugs.</p>")

 2015)"
  :long "<p>The following is a brief summary of changes made to the @(see

 <p>The <a
 href='https://github.com/acl2/acl2/wiki/Release-version-numbers'>acl2-books

 corresponding to releases.  See also @(see note-7-0) for the changes made to
 ACL2 itself.  For additional details, you may also see the raw <a
 href='https://github.com/acl2/acl2/commits/master'>commit log</a>.</p>

 <h2>Organizational, Build System, and Name Changes</h2>


 <h3>Source Code Moved</h3>

 <p>The ACL2 Community Books and ACL2 System source code repositories have been
 merged into one repository and are now available at</p>

 <box><p><a
 href=\"https://github.com/acl2/acl2\">https://github.com/acl2/acl2</a></p></box>

 <p>See the @('Readme.md') file found there for more details.  See also the
 @(see git-quick-start) guide if you are interested in contributing.</p>



 <h3>Deleted Stubs</h3>

 <p>When we move a book, we often add a <b>stub</b> book in its previous
 location to help you transition your @(see include-book) commands.  The @(see
 build::cert.pl) build system prints warnings when a stub book is being
 included.</p>

 <p>Stub books have a lifespan of one release.  The following books were stubs
 in ACL2 6.5, so we've deleted them.</p>

 @({
      Previous Location                New Location
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
      str/*                            std/strings/*

      centaur/bitops/sign-extend       centaur/bitops/fast-logext

    ---------------------------------------------------------------
 })


 <h3>Build System Changes</h3>

 <p>The @('arithmetic-2') library is no longer built by default when running an
 ordinary @('make').  All books that previously depended on @('arithmetic-2')
 have been transitioned to use @('arithmetic-3') instead.  If your own work
 depends on @('arithmetic-2'), you can still build these books, e.g., by running
 @('make arithmetic-2') in the @('books') directory.</p>

 <p>Many minor tweaks and cleanups have been made to the build system
 itself.</p>

 <ul>

 <li>@('cert.pl') now has better support for @(see
 provisional-certification).</li>

 <li>The @(see build::cert_param) mechanism, which is used by @(see
 build::cert.pl) to indicate that books have special requirements, is now
 documented.</li>

 <li>New @('cert_param') directives have been added to avoid certifying certain
 books on incompatible Lisps.</li>

 <li>@(see build::cert.pl) now better avoids overflowing the maximum number of
 arguments to shell commands on some platforms when certifying large numbers of
 books.</li>

 <li>The new @(':ignore-certs') feature of @(see include-book) is now used in
 special two-pass books like @('std/strings/defs-program.lisp'), and should help
 to make building these books more reliable.</li>

 <li>Hundreds of old Makefiles from the @(see books-certification-classic) era
 have been eliminated.  Some obsolete GCL-specific directives have also been
 eliminated.</li>

 <li>Installing @(see quicklisp) now works from behind a proxy.  See <i>Using a
 Proxy</i> in @(see books-certification) for details.</li>

 <li>The implementation of ``@('make everything')'' has been cleaned up.  In
 particular, it no longer sets @('USE_QUICKLISP=1') since this is not
 appropriate for some Lisps.</li>

 <li>The @('make clean') command now does a better job of cleaning up generated
 files.</li>

 </ul>

 <p>Numerous books have been patched up for better portability across Lisps and
 integration with ACL2(p).  For instance: In many cases, previous calls of @(see
 without-waterfall-parallelism) are no longer necessary, largely due to
 thread-safe memoization; several @(see oslib) functions have been extended to
 work on additional Lisps; many books with raw Lisp code now use @(see
 include-raw) for more portable compilation behavior across Lisps.</p>

 <p>Various other utilities have been made more reliable.</p>

 <ul>

 <li>For Emacs @('TAGS') users, the @('etags.sh') script has been improved to
 permit whitespace before definitions.</li>

 <li>For ACL2 packaging mechanisms, the @('fix-cert') utility has been improved
 and now includes scripts for moving ACL2 distributions.</li>

 </ul>

 <p>Supporting scripts for the <a href='http://jenkins-ci.org/'>Jenkins</a>
 continuous integration server can now be found in the @('build/jenkins')
 directory.  These scripts have received significant attention and can now
 support multi-configuration builds for checking ACL2 books compatibility with
 many host Lisps.</p>


 <h3>Name Conflict Resolution</h3>

 <p>Progress has been made toward resolving name clashes in order to be able to
 include more books together.  This work involves renaming certain lemmas and
 may require updates to your books.</p>

 <p>Arithmetic-2</p>

 <ul>
 <li>@('floor-mod-elim') no longer forces its hypothesis.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>Arithmetic-5</p>
 <ul>
 <li>@('floor-=-x/y') now has additional corollaries.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>IHS</p>
 <ul>
 <li>@('floor-mod-elim') no longer forces its hypothesis.</li>
 <li>@('floor-=-x/y') now has additional corollaries.</li>
 <li>@('justify-floor-recursion') has been renamed to @('floor-recursion').</li>
 <li>@('cancel-floor-+') has been renamed to @('cancel-floor-+-basic').</li>
 <li>@('cancel-mod-+') has been renamed to @('cancel-mod-+-basic').</li>
 <li>@('rationalp-mod') no longer requires @('(rationalp x)').</li>
 </ul>

 <p>COI/osets</p>

 <ul>

 <li>Many @('coi/osets') books are now just small wrappers around @('std/osets')
 books.</li>

 <li>COI's @('double-containment') rule has been renamed to
 @('double-containment-expensive').</li>

 </ul>


 <h3>Licensing Changes</h3>

 <p>Robert Krug's @('arithmetic-3') library of is now available under a
 BSD-3-Clause style license instead of the GNU General Public License.</p>

 <p>Several books contributed by David Rager, which were formerly released under
 the GNU General Public License or a BSD-3-Clause style license, are now instead
 released under a (more permissive) MIT/X11-style license.</p>

 <p>Several books contributed by Oracle, which were formerly released under the
 GNU General Public License, are now instead released under an MIT/X11-style
 license.</p>

 <p>The @(see ubdds) library and a few \"miscellaneous\" books have also been
 transitioned from the GNU General Public License to a 3-clause BSD style
 license.</p>

 <p>Several books in the @('coi') library, which previously lacked explicit
 license information, now have explicit MIT/X11-style licenses.</p>


 <h2>New Libraries and Documentation</h2>

 <p>The ACL2+Books manual has a great deal of new and improved content and many
 topics have been reorganized to provide a more coherent hierarchy.  Notably,
 all documentation in the legacy <i>defdoc</i> format has been rewritten into
 the @(see xdoc) format.  Some highlights:</p>

 <ul>
 <li>The @(see ihs) documentation has been considerably updated.</li>
 <li>The @(see defsort) macro is now documented.</li>
 <li>The @(see sneaky) documentation has been considerably expanded.</li>
 <li>Topics like @(see lists), @(see strings), @(see alists), etc., now
 group together some related @(see programming) functions.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>The ACL2 @(see Sidekick) is an experimental and very preliminary graphical
 add-on to ACL2.  It currently features a session viewer, theory linter, a
 horribly primitive interface to the @(see proof-checker), and a slick
 <i>Lookup</i> feature that can show you documentation and other information
 about various symbols.</p>

 <p>The new @('system/toothbrush') directory provides a way to create
 applications with ACL2 that have a much smaller memory footprint than an
 ordinary ACL2 @(see save-exec) image.  See the @('README') file in this
 directory for more information.</p>

 <p>The new @(see depgraph::depgraph) library now contains a few algorithms for
 working with dependency graphs.  It provides @(see depgraph::toposort), a
 topological sort, @(see depgraph::invert), an edge-inversion algorithm, and
 @(see depgraph::transdeps), which can compute the transitive dependencies for a
 set of nodes.  This functionality was formerly part of @(see VL) but has now
 been made more general and extracted.</p>

 <p>The new @('projects/codewalker/') directory contains Codewalker, a utility
 for exploring code in any programming language specified by an ACL2 model to
 discover certain properties of the code.  Demos of Codewalker are also in that
 directory.</p>

 <p>The new directory @('projects/hybrid-systems/') is a
 specification/verification project by Shant Harutuntian using ACL2(r) (see
 @(see real)), in support of his 2007 Ph.D. dissertation, with a few recent
 updates (because of ACL2 changes) made by Cuong Chau.</p>

 <p>There are also several new small tools and books.</p>

 <ul>

 <li>(CCL Only) The new @(see spacewalk) tool can be used to get a report about
 heap memory usage.  It may be useful for identifying unusually large functions
 and constants in your ACL2 session.</li>

 <li>The new @(see simp) tool can be used to ask ACL2 to simplify terms under
 certain hypotheses.</li>

 <li>The new tool @('misc/check-fn-inst') can be used to check the constraints
 to a functional instantiation.</li>

 <li>The new tool, @(see def-saved-obligs), can be used to save proof
 obligations for an event as independent defthms.</li>

 <li>The new tool, @('system/dead-source-code.lisp'), may be useful
 for finding dead code in the ACL2 sources.</li>

 <li>The new books @('system/cantor-pairing-bijective.lisp') and
 @('system/hl-nat-combine-onto.lisp') contain proofs of bijectivity and
 surjectivity (one-one/onto and onto, respectively) of cantor-pairing
 functions.</li>

 </ul>

 <h2>Changes to Major Libraries</h2>

 <h3>XDOC Changes</h3>

 <p>The web-based XDOC viewer has been improved.  It now uses newer versions of
 the JQuery and Typeahead libraries.  Some bugs with the typeahead (jump to) box
 have been fixed and it has been extended to show more results.  The jump-to box
 has been extended with a @('Alt+/') hotkey (or perhaps some other key
 combination like @('Ctrl+/'), depending on your browser).  Middle clicking on
 XDOC links should now properly open them in new tabs and the fonts have been
 updated.  Some ugly quotes are now replaced by ``smart'' replacements.</p>

 <p>Significant work has been done to try to make XDOC content accessible to
 search engines such as Google.  A new PHP script largely replaces previous
 failed efforts to generate \"static\" HTML files, site maps, and so forth.</p>

 <p>XDOC now supports \"resource directories\" for incorporating images, PDF
 files, and other kinds of resources.  See @(see xdoc::add-resource-directory)
 for details.</p>

 <p>XDOC now features @(see xdoc::katex-integration) for writing LaTeX-like
 formulas like @($ \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{n} \\sqrt{f(i)} \\right) <
 \\frac{n^2}{k} $) within your documentation.  Note that ACL2's new @(see
 fancy-string-reader) can be used to make escaping simpler, and this may be
 especially useful when trying to write LaTeX-like formulas, where the escaping
 of @('\\') characters can be irritating.</p>

 <p>There are also many other minor changes:</p>

 <ul>

 <li>The @(see defpointer) macro has been integrated into XDOC itself.  (It was
 formerly only part of the ACL2 system documentation.)</li>

 <li>@(see defsection) and @(see define) now permit plain strings to be included
 among the list of events.  These strings are incorporated into the resulting
 documentation as running commentary.</li>

 <li>The @(see defxdoc), @(see defsection), and @(see define) macros now all
 evaluate the arguments to @(':short') and @(':long') instead of quoting them.
 This may make it more convenient to write macros that produce documentation
 from boilerplate templates, e.g., you can now directly write things like
 @(':short (cat ...)').</li>

 <li>Tweaked @(see defsection) so that you can give @(':extension (foo)')
 instead of just @(':extension foo.')</li>

 <li>Better error handling on @(see xdoc::xdoc-extend) and @(see
 xdoc::xdoc-prepend).</li>

 </ul>



 <h3>@(see STD) Library Changes</h3>


 <h5>@(see std/basic)</h5>

 <p>Added @(see tuplep) and @(see impossible).</p>


 <h5>@(see std/lists)</h5>

 <p>Cleaned up rules about take in @(see std/lists/take).</p>

 <p>@(see replicate) is now an alias for @(see repeat) and is compatible with
 the definition of @('repeat') in the COI libraries, fixing a longstanding
 incompatibility.</p>

 <p>The @(see all-equalp) function has been added.</p>

 <p>Several lemmas about @(see intersection$), @(see intersectp), and @(see
 set-difference$) have been extracted from @(see vl) and moved into
 @('std/lists').  See for instance @(see std/lists/intersection$),
 @(see std/lists/intersectp), and @(see std/lists/set-difference).</p>




 <h5>@(see std/util)</h5>

 <p>The @(see b*) binders for @(see std::defaggregate)s now also bind the
 variable, fixing a longstanding issue.  Also, the syntax @('((prodname name))')
 is now permitted as an abbreviation for @('((prodname name) name)').  (This is
 often useful when destructuring a function's arguments).</p>

 <p>The @(see b*) binders for @(see std::defaggregate) (and also @(see
 fty::defprod)) are now extensible and can translate bindings like @('x.foo')
 into calls of user-defined functions.  See the description of <i>Extra Binder
 Names</i> in the documentation of @(see std::defaggregate) for details.</p>

 <p>The @(see std::deflist), @(see std::defalist), @(see std::defprojection),
 and @(see std::defmapappend) macros are now \"pluggable\" and can be extended
 with additional theorems; see for instance the new book
 @('std/lists/abstract.lisp').</p>

 <p>The new books @('std/util/deflist-base') and @('std/util/defalist-base')
 offer lighter-weight alternative to @('std/util/deflist') and
 @('std/util/defalist').</p>

 <p>The @(see std::defrule) book now has fewer dependencies.</p>

 <p>Documentation for @(see std::deflist) has been improved.  @('Deflist') now
 uses @(see define) so that you get a signature block in the resulting
 documentation.  The documentation for automatically generated deflist events is
 now put in a more sensible order and split off into a @('foolistp-basics')
 section underneath of @('foolistp'), to reduce the prominence of this
 \"boilerplate\" documentation.  Deflist can now also create documentation even
 in the @('already-definedp') case.</p>

 <p>Fixed an obscure bug with @(see define)'s return-specifiers that could
 affect non-executable functions that involve stobjs.</p>

 <p>The @(see define) macro now interprets @(':inline nil') as \"make this a
 <see topic='@(url defun-notinline)'>$notinline</see> function\" instead of
 \"make this a regular function instead of an <see topic='@(url
 defun-inline)'>inline</see> one.\"</p>

 <p>The @(see define), @(see defines), and also the @(see fty::deffixequiv)
 macros now have improved, more advanced default hints set for inductive proofs
 in return specs and @('deffixequiv(-mutual)') forms.</p>


 <h5>@(see std/strings)</h5>

 <p>Certification time has been improved.</p>

 <p>The @('fast-cat') book (see @(see str::cat)) now uses @(see include-raw) to
 avoid possible issues on various Lisps.</p>

 <h5>@(see std/io)</h5>

 <p>Added @(see read-file-as-string) function.</p>

 <h5>@(see std/alists)</h5>

 <p>There are some new functions: @(see fal-find-any) and @(see
 fal-all-boundp).</p>

 <p>Moved @(see worth-hashing) into @('std/alists') from
 @('misc/hons-help').</p>

 <h5>@(see std/typed-lists)</h5>

 <p>Move @(see cons-listp) and @(see cons-list-listp) out of VL and into
 @('std/typed-lists').</p>



 <h3>Defdata (Data Definition Framework)</h3>

 <p> @('Defdata') has undergone significant improvements.  Automated theorem
 proving support has been increased by a tight integration with @(csee
 Tau-system).  A significant new capability is the support for parametric
 polymorphism via @('sig') rules. There have been many improvements in its
 engineering too.</p>

 <h5>Tau Integration</h5>
 <p>
 Defdata analyzes the predicate definition of every new type and, if
 possible, produces a set of Tau rules that completely characterize
 the type. Defdata thus provides the following guarantee: If Tau is
 complete over the type reasoning theory, then adding a type to the
 current theory via @('defdata') preserves completeness.
 </p>

 <h5>Parametric Polymorphism</h5>
 <p>
 Defdata provides a new macro @('sig') which can be used to define
 signatures of polymorphic functions
 such as <tt>append</tt>, <tt>remove1</tt>, <tt>put-assoc</tt> etc:
 </p>
 @({
   (sig append ((listof :a) (listof :a)) => (listof :a))
   (sig remove1-equal (all (listof :a)) => (listof :a))
   (sig put-assoc-equal (:a :b (alistof :a :b)) => (alistof :a :b))
 })

 <p>
 Defdata automatically instantiates these generic theorems
 (type signatures) for previously defined types and as new types are defined
 after the @('sig') forms. Defdata, thus implements parametric polymorphism, by
 providing the following invariants:</p>

 <ul>
 <li> Every new defdata type is instantiated for every polymorphic
      signature (specified via sig) that matches (one of its argument
      types).</li>
 <li> Every new polymorphic signature is appropriately instantiated for
      all defdata types of the right shape in the current world. </li>
 </ul>

 <p> Dependent type hypotheses are supported by @('sig') -- e.g. the
 polymorphic signature of <tt>nth</tt> is specified as follows.  </p>

 @({
   (sig nth (nat (listof :a)) => :a
        :satisfies (< x1 (len x2)))
 })

 <h5>Other Theory Reasoning</h5>

 <p>Theory support for Records (structs) and Maps has been tuned to be more
 robust. Destructor Elimination is now available for records.</p>

 <h5>Advanced Usage</h5>
 <p>
 @('Defdata') has been re-engineered to have a plug-in like
 architecture. The following macros provide ways to extend the Defdata
 language and its semantics.</p>
 <dl>
 <dd> @('register-type') -- Register a name as a defdata type (with its associated metadata).</dd>
 <dd> @('register-data-constructor') -- Register a data constructor (for product types).</dd>
 <dd> @('register-user-combinator') -- Add user-defined syntactic sugar to the defdata language.
 e.g. <i>alistof</i> was added with minimal coding overhead using this facility (See defdata/alistof.lisp).</dd>
 <dd> @('defdata-attach') -- Replaces/subsumes) defdata-testing; it can be used to change or add defdata type metadata. </dd>
 </dl>


 <h3>Defsort</h3>

 <p>The interface to @(see defsort) has been extended, and it can now reuse
 existing list recognizers.</p>

 <p>Defsort can now (optionally) prove that the new sorting function is
 equivalent to an insertion sort.</p>

 <p>Defsort now allows extra arguments, e.g., to parameterize the sort.</p>



 <h3>Tools</h3>

 <p>The @(see include-raw) utility has been made more robust.  It now checks the
 write-date of compiled files, to avoid including stale files.</p>

 <p>The utilities @(see profile-acl2) and @(see profile-all) now work in the
 ACL2 loop, and are documented.</p>

 <p>The @('watch') utility works again.  Thanks to Bob Boyer for providing
 fixes.  To use this utility:</p>

 @({
    (include-book \"centaur/memoize/old/watch\" :dir :system :ttags :all)
    :q
    (watch)
    (lp)
    ; Now in Emacs, bring into a buffer the file reported by (watch), whose
    ; name is of the form watch-output-temp-n.lsp.  Then execute ACL2 forms.
 })

 <p>The @(see untranslate-patterns) tool is now compatible with @(see define)'s
 @(see untranslate-preprocess) hook.</p>


 <h3>OSLIB</h3>

 <p>OSLIB has been reorganized to try to make it somewhat more coherent.  Most
 files in oslib are now split up into, e.g., argv-logic.lisp (no raw code or
 ttags) and argv.lisp (actual implementation).</p>

 <p>OSLIB has new functions including @(see oslib::dirname), @(see
 oslib::basename), @(see oslib::copy), and @(see oslib::catpaths).</p>

 <p>The @(see oslib::ls), @(see oslib::ls-files), and @(see oslib::ls-subdirs)
 functions have been improved to return better error information, and made more
 portable across Lisps.</p>

 <h3>Tau</h3>

 <p>The book @('tau/bounders/elementary-bounders') has been improved by adding
 guards, thanks to Dmitry Nadezhin.</p>

 <h2>Changes to Centaur Libraries</h2>

 <h3>@(see bitops)</h3>

 <p>The new @(see bitops::bitops/part-install) macro can be used to set particular bits of an
 integer to a value.  It is somewhat similar to utilities like @(see wrb) from
 the IHS library, but its interface is perhaps more intuitive.</p>

 <p>The new @(see bitops::bitops/fast-rotate) macros provide optimized versions of @(see
 rotate-left) and @(see rotate-right).</p>

 <p>The new @(see bitops::bitops/logbitp-bounds) book provides a few lemmas relating
 @(see logbitp) to @(see expt).</p>


 <h3>@(see fty::fty)</h3>

 <p>The @(see std::deflist) and @(see fty::deflist) books are now integrated, so
 that @('fty::deflist') can provide the ordinary @('std::deflist') theorems.
 The @('fty::deflist') and @('fty::defalist') macros now provide at least @(see
 append) theorems by default.</p>

 <p>The documentation-generating macros have been enhanced.</p>

 <p>The @(see fty::deftypes) macro now uses more aggressive theory management to
 speed up certification, and also has more comprehensive error checking.</p>

 <p>The @(see fty::deffixtype) macro has better error checking.</p>

 <p>The cases macros introduced by @(see fty::deftypes) now support an
 @(':otherwise') case.</p>

 <p>The @(see fty::deftypes) @('make-') macros now disallow duplicated
 keywords.</p>

 <p>The @(see fty::deflist) and @(see fty::defalist) macros can now tolerate
 already-defined predicates.</p>

 <p>The @(see fty::basetypes) book has been filled out a bit, e.g., it now includes
 @(see maybe-natp).</p>

 <p>By default, @(see fty::deffixtype) now verifies the guards on the equivalence
 relations it introduces.</p>

 <h3>@(see Quicklisp)</h3>

 <p>Quicklisp can now read proxy information from the @('HTTP_PROXY_WITH_PORT')
 environment variable.  See also the \"Using a proxy\" page in @(see
 books-certification).  BOZO move that into Quicklisp?  Blah, all this stuff
 always ends up duplicated everywhere.</p>

 <p>Quicklisp now includes books for loading the @('uiop') library and a more
 sensible @('cl-fad') book.  These libraries may be useful for doing file system
 things.  The CCL-only restrictions on @('bordeaux-threads') and
 @('hunchentoot') have been dropped since these libraries seem to be working
 fine on modern SBCL distributions.  A book for the @('html-template') library
 has also been added.</p>

 <p>The Quicklisp build should be more robust.  It now checks for existing
 Quicklisp installations and produce a sensible error message instead of dying
 horribly.</p>


 <h3>Other</h3>

 <p>The @(see getopt) library now has a basic test suite.</p>

 <p>The @('centaur/misc/sharedlibs') code for relocating shared libraries has
 been extended with a test/demo script.  The sharedlibs functions no longer
 cause errors when used on non-CCL Lisps (they simply print a message,
 instead.)</p>

 <p>The @(see template-subst) tool has been expanded with some additional
 functions.</p>

 <p>The @(see profile-all) and @(see profile-acl2) functions can now be used
 from within the ACL2 loop instead of only from raw Lisp.</p>

 <p>The @(see flag::def-doublevar-induction) macro has been extended and improved.</p>

 <p>For @(see esim), there is a new tool for @(see stv) decomposition theorems,
 @('oracle/stv-decomp-theory-expander.lisp'), and a demo of using this tool in
 @('centaur/regression/composed-stv.lisp').  The documentation tables for STVs
 should now look nicer in the printer-friendly xdoc view.</p>

 <p>In the @(see 4v) library, there are a few new @(see *sexpr-rewrites*).</p>

 <p>Minor bug-fix to avoid complaint in an @(see aignet) @('bind-free')
 routine.</p>

 <p>Added @(see satlink::gather-benchmarks), a plugin for collecting DIMACS
 files that SATLINK sends to the SAT solver. You could use this to gather
 benchmarks for evaluating SAT solvers or for the SAT solving competitions.</p>

 <p>In @(see gl), fixed a bug in @('trace-gl-interp').</p>



 <h3>VL Changes</h3>

 <p>VL has undergone significant extensions and changes, mostly toward extending
 VL to support a subset of SystemVerilog.  VL is intended to also still support
 Verilog-2005, and in many cases its Verilog-2005 support has been improved as
 new SystemVerilog features have been implemented.  Some highlights:</p>

 <ul>

 <li>VL now has a more extensive \"systest\" suite for checking its work against
 NCVerilog and VCS, and a preliminary \"failtest\" suite for ensuring that
 certain modules with bad constructs are properly rejected.</li>

 <li>Added parsing support for many constructs such as interfaces, packages,
 generate statements, structs, unpacked arrays, etc.  The parser functions now
 pass around a \"parse state\" object and generates warnings in a more coherent
 way.  This results in certain speedups to its certification and allows for
 distinguishing the names of data types from other identifiers, which is
 necessary for parsing certain constructs.</li>

 <li>More comprehensive parameter support.  This involved reworking
 unparameterization to handle SystemVerilog data types, and adding support for
 richer expressions in wire ranges, etc., by reworking how constant expressions
 are evaluated to handle many more operators and operands of mixed sizes/types.
 Generate statements are also now supported to some degree.</li>

 <li>Added support for fancier ports, e.g., ports with data types, module
 instances with @('.name') and @('.*') style connections, and interface
 ports.</li>

 <li>Added support for combinational user-defined primitives, and at least basic
 parsing support for sequential UDPs.</li>

 <li>Added some support for SystemVerilog packages and imports.  A new
 \"scopestack\" abstraction is now widely used to provide more comprehensive
 handling of nested scopes (e.g., named begin/end blocks), packages, etc.  There
 is now some support for functions defined at the global scope.</li>

 <li>Sizing has been extended to handle unpacked arrays.  The sizing code has
 been reorganized to be more modular, and extended to handle additional
 operators.</li>

 <li>Miscellaneous improvements.  The pretty-printer has been extended to handle
 the new SystemVerilog constructs, ansi-style ports, etc.  Some transforms are
 more configurable, e.g., gate elimination can easily use alternate replacements
 for gate instances.  There is better support for @('case') statements,
 especially in @('always_comb') blocks.  Various operators are now supported to
 various degrees, e.g., @('++'), casting operators, @('$bits'), streaming
 concatenations.  The preprocessor now supports @('`define') macros with
 arguments.  The hierarchy tools have been greatly simplified.</li>

 <li>Numerous organizational changes, bug fixes, and updates to existing tools
 and transforms to keep things working.</li>

 </ul>

 <p>Besides these improvements to the core library, there have been various user
 interface improvements.  For instance, the VL @(see vl::server) has been
 entirely rewritten and is now included in the @(see vl::kit); it allows you to
 view Verilog modules in a web browser.  The loader has been made more
 user-friendly and more gracefully handles search paths, errors, etc.  The
 @(see vl::lint)er has been tweaked to provide better output and to run more
 quickly.</p>")

 <h2>Organization, Build, and Licensing Changes</h2>

 <h3>Deleted Stubs</h3>

 <p>When we move a book, we often add a <b>stub</b> book in its previous
 location to help you transition your @(see include-book) commands.  The @(see
 build::cert.pl) build system prints warnings when a stub book is being
 included.</p>

 <p>Stub books have a lifespan of one release.  The following books were stubs
 in ACL2 6.4, so we've deleted them.</p>

 @({
      Previous Location                         New Location

      centaur/bitops/sbitsets                   std/bitsets/sbitsets
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
 })


 <h3>Book Reorganization</h3>

 <p>We've moved several books to new homes in an effort to improve the overall
 organization of the books.  Users of these libraries will need to update their
 @(see include-book) commands, and in some cases, packages have also
 changed.</p>

 <p>The table below shows which libraries have moved and where they have moved
 to.  Books with stubs may continue to work until the next release, but you'll
 need to update your @('include-book')s eventually.</p>


 @({
    Stubs?     Previous Location        New Location
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Yes       str/                     std/strings/

     No        memoize/                 centaur/memoize/

     No        centaur/doc.lisp         doc/top.lisp

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 })

 <p>The @(see defpkg) commands for @(see xdoc), @(see std/strings), @(see
 std/osets), and @(see std/bitsets) have been merged into a single
 @('std/package.lsp') file, with a single corresponding @('std/portcullis.lisp')
 file, to simplify package management.</p>


 <h3>Name Conflict Resolution</h3>

 <p>Preliminary work has been carried out toward unifying coi/std versions of
 osets.  In particular:</p>

 <ul>
 <li>The @(see std/osets) package has been changed from @('SETS') to @('SET').</li>
 <li>The @('coi/osets') library now uses the @('std/osets') package files.</li>
 <li>Some @('coi/osets') books now merely include the corresponding files from
 @('std/osets').</li>
 </ul>

 <p>The @(see std/lists) function @('repeat') has been renamed to @(see
 replicate), and had its arguments reordered, to resolve a name clash with the
 coi library.  See <a
 href='https://code.google.com/p/acl2-books/issues/detail?id=136'>Issue 136</a>
 for additional discussion about this change.</p>

 <p>The @('data-structures') library @('STRUCTURES') package has been renamed to
 @('DEFSTRUCTURE') to resolve a name conflicts with the COI books.</p>

 <p>The @(see bitops) library's @('sign-extend') function has been renamed to
 @(see fast-logext) to resolve a name conflict with the @(see rtl)
 library.</p>

 <p>The new @('tools/book-conflicts') tool can be used to detect name conflicts
 between books.  See its @('README') file for more information.</p>


 <h3>Build System Changes</h3>

 <p>Support for ACL2(r) is now directly included in the top-level Makefile.
 ACL2(r) users no longer need to use a separate build process and can now make
 use of many additional books.  Books that are incompatible with ACL2(r) should
 be annotated with @('non-acl2r') @('cert_param')s, and books that require
 ACL2(r) should have a @('uses-acl2r') cert_param.</p>


 <p>The top-level Makefile has been made more robust in various ways.</p>

 <ul>

 <li>Certification of books under @('models/y86') has a cleaner implementation.
 These books are no longer certified by the @('make') target @('all') since they
 are resource intensive.  For ACL2(h) and host Lisps that can handle this task,
 they are certified by using the target @('everything').  Also, the value of the
 @('-j') option of the @('make') command is no longer ignored.</li>

 <li>It no longer tries to build certain long-running books when USE_QUICKLISP
 is set and Hons is not present.</li>

 <li>It no longer tries to build the @(see gl) solutions book, as this can
 overwhelm modest machines.</li>

 <li>A new @('ccl-only') @('cert_param') can be used for books that require CCL.
 Used this to avoid trying to certify certain books that require, e.g., @(see
 tshell).</li>

 <li>The @(see esim-tutorial) books have been removed from @('doc/top.lisp') to
 avoid requiring Glucose to build the ACL2+Books manual.</li>

 <li>Certain problematic books have been annotated with @(see
 non-parallel-book), to avoid incompatibilities with @(see
 waterfall-parallelism) problems on ACL2(p).</li>

 </ul>


 <p>The @(see build::cert.pl) build system has been enhanced in many ways.  Of
 particular note, it now deals more automatically with portcullis files, which
 may help to improve the reliability of including uncertified files.  Other
 improvements include:</p>

 <ul>
  <li>Better support for generated books</li>
  <li>Support for ACL2 images that start up in other packages</li>
  <li>Enhanced @('--help') message with more information</li>
  <li>Added support for @(see add-include-book-dir!)</li>
  <li>More informative error messages in certain cases</li>
  <li>Miscellaneous, minor bug fixes, e.g., support for @('$') in book names.</li>
 </ul>


 <p>The build speed has been improved in various ways.</p>

 <ul>

 <li>Many books have reordered @(see include-book) to take advantage of new
 optimizations in ACL2.</li>

 <li>The performance of the @('tau/bounders/elementary-bounders') book has been
 significantly improved, reducing the critical path time for the @('make all')
 target.</li>

 <li>A computationally expensive proof has been split out of the
 @('defung-stress') book, also substantially improving the critical path for
 @('make all').</li>

 <li>Reduced dependencies in @(see std/util), @(see std/lists), @(see
 std/alists), and @(see xdoc) to speed up certification.</li>

 </ul>

 <p>Added a TAGS target to the Makefile.</p>

 <p>Added scripts to support using a <a
 href='http://jenkins-ci.org/'>Jenkins</a> continuous integration server to
 continually rebuild ACL2 and the books on various platforms.</p>

 <h2>New Libraries, Demos, and Documentation</h2>

 <h5>New Libraries and Tools</h5>

 <p>The @('workshops/2014') directory contains contributions from the ACL2
 Workshop for 2014.</p>

 <p>The new @(see remove-hyps) tool may be useful for identifying unnecessary
 hypotheses in theorems.</p>

 <p>@(see fty::fty) is a new library offers functionality similar to @(see std)
 or @(see defdata) libraries.  This library enforces a certain fixing-function
 discipline and may help to avoid many type-like hypotheses on theorems.</p>

 <p>The new book @('tools/rewrite-with-equality.lisp') is a certified clause
 processor that causes certain equality hypotheses to cause massive substitution
 of the \"good\" term for the \"bad\" term in clauses that are stable under
 simplification.</p>

 <p>The new @(see with-supporters) macro can be used to automatically produce
 redundant versions of events that are needed from local include books.</p>

 <p>The new @(see flag::def-doublevar-induction) macro can be used to create
 certain kinds of induction schemes, and may be especially useful for proving
 @(see congruence) rules about mutually recursive functions.</p>

 <p>The new @(see nrev) book is something like @('nreverse').  It can be used to
 implement in-order, tail-recursive list processing functions.  With a trust
 tag, these functions can avoid the memory overhead of a final @(see
 reverse).</p>

 <p>The new @(see fast-alist-pop) function provides something akin to
 @('remhash') for fast alists, with various restrictions and limitations.</p>

 <p>The new @('system/hons-check') books provide some basic tests for the @(see
 hons-and-memoization) code.</p>

 <p>The new @('oracle/') directory contains tools and examples from Oracle,
 Inc.</p>

 <h5>New Demos</h5>

 <p>A new demo, @('demos/tutorial-problems/equivalence-of-two-functions'), shows
 some ways to prove the equivalence of two functions that recur in different
 ways.</p>

 <p>A new demo, @('demos/knuth-bendix-problem-1.lisp'), has been added.</p>

 <p>COI's @('defung') has a new fractran example: see
 @('coi/defung/fractran.lisp').</p>

 <p>A new demo, @('demos/gl-and-use-example.lisp'), shows a way to use GL to
 establish the crux of an unbounded theorem.</p>


 <h5>New Documentation</h5>

 <p>The @(see cowles), @(see arithmetic-1), and @(see rtl) libraries now
 have some XDOC documentation.</p>

 <p>There are now some preliminary recommendations for @(see best-practices) for
 developing ACL2 books.</p>

 <p>The documentation for portions of the @(see ihs) library and @(see plev) had
 been inadvertently excluded from the manual, but are now included.</p>

 <p>A new topic describes some noteworthy @(see clause-processor-tools).</p>

 <p>The topic hierarchy has received some attention, e.g., all topics that were
 formerly listed under the grab-bag @('switches-parameters-and-modes') have been
 relocated to more suitable homes.</p>

 <p>Converted the documentation for @(see esim), @(see b*), and other topics
 into @(see xdoc) format.</p>

 <p>Many topics have been improved by eliminating typos, making minor
 clarifications, adding appropriate cross-references, fixing broken links, and
 ensuring that @(':parents') are correct.</p>



 <h2>Changes to Major Libraries</h2>

 <h3>XDOC Changes</h3>

 <p>The new @(see xdoc::order-subtopics) command can be used to control the
 order that subtopics are presented in.</p>

 <p>The \"classic\" XDOC viewer is no longer supported.</p>

 <p>The XDOC viewers have been improved in many ways.</p>

 <ul>

 <li>Fancy manuals now produce a clear error message for users of IE8 and IE9,
 and will work properly for users of IE11.  (IE10 still works, as before).</li>

 <li>Fancy manuals now load much more quickly (faster jump-to box
 initialization).</li>

 <li>The :doc command and the @(see acl2-doc) tool now show URLs for external
 links.</li>

 <li>XDOC now includes tools that can create a <a
 href='http://www.sitemaps.org/'>sitemap</a> and other \"static\" HTML files,
 which may be useful for search engine optimization.</li>

 <li>Added @('.htaccess') files to fancy manuals, which can enable server-side
 compression for significant file size/performance improvements.</li>

 </ul>


 <p>Various bugs have also been fixed in the core XDOC system.</p>

 <ul>

 <li>The @('@(def ...)') directive sometimes printed the wrong event; this has
 been fixed.  It also now handles mutually recursive functions more nicely.</li>

 <li>The @(see xdoc::save) command should no longer cause an error when trying
 to write manuals to paths like @('~/my-manual').</li>

 <li>Fixed bugs in XDOC's handling of <tt>@@('...')</tt> and <tt>@@({...})</tt>
 directives, and otherwise improved error messages with more context.</li>

 <li>Fixed a problem with @(see xdoc::xdoc-extend) when the topic to extend
 lacked a @(':long') string.</li>

 </ul>

 <p>Other minor changes:</p>

 <ul>

 <li>XDOC now uses @(see str::pretty) instead of @(see fmt-to-string) and the
 preprocessor uses @(see state) less than before.</li>

 <li>Factored xdoc tests out of the main directory and excluded them from the
 basic build, to improve build times.</li>

 </ul>



 <h3>@(csee Std) Library Changes</h3>

 <h5>@(see std/basic)</h5>

 <p>A new book of basic @(see induction-schemes) has been added.</p>

 <p>Certain equivalence relations like @(see chareqv) and @(see streqv) have
 been factored out of the @(see std/strings) library and moved into
 @('std/basic') instead, mainly to improve integration with the new @(see
 fty::fty) library.</p>

 <p>@(see lnfix) and @(see lifix) are now enabled, inlined functions instead of
 macros.  This may help to simplify guard obligations in functions that call
 @('lnfix') and @('lifix').</p>


 <h5>@(see std/lists)</h5>

 <p>An @(see std/lists/update-nth) book has been added.</p>

 <p>A @('remove-duplicates') book has been added with lemmas about @(see
 remove-duplicates-equal) and @(see hons-remove-duplicates).</p>

 <p>Added a missing rule about @(see acl2-count) to
 @('std/lists/acl2-count').</p>

 <p>@(see uniquep) no longer uses @(see equality-variants).  Theorems that
 target @('uniquep') should be rewritten in terms of @('no-duplicatesp').</p>

 <p>Various books have been reorganized to reduce dependencies.</p>


 <h5>@(see std/alists)</h5>

 <p>The general purpose alist functions @(see append-alist-vals) and @(see
 append-alist-keys) have been moved out of @(see vl) and into @(see
 std/alists).</p>

 <p>There are new books for @(see alist-fix) and @(see hons-remove-assoc).</p>

 <p>The new @('fast-alist-clean') book includes lemmas about @(see
 fast-alist-fork) and @(see fast-alist-clean).</p>

 <p>Various books have been reorganized to reduce dependencies.</p>


 <h5>@(see std/osets)</h5>

 <p>Most osets functions are now disabled by default.  They can be re-enabled
 using the ruleset @('set::definitions').</p>

 <p>Some useful but sometimes expensive rules, including for instance the @(see
 set::pick-a-point-subset-strategy) and @(see set::double-containment), and also
 including other rules such as the transitivity of @(see set::subset), are now
 disabled by default.  They can be re-enabled using the ruleset
 @('set::expensive-rules').</p>


 <h5>@(see std/util)</h5>

 <p>Some new macros have been added.</p>

 <ul>

 <li>@(see std::defines) can introduce mutually recursive functions, using a
 @(see std::define)-like syntax, and features automatic integration with @(see
 make-flag).</li>

 <li>@(see std::defval) is like @(see defconst) but has @(see xdoc) integration.</li>

 <li>@(see std::defsum) is a preliminary macro for tagged union types.</li>

 <li>@(see std::defaggrify-defrec) adds @(see std::defaggregate)-style emulation
 for structures introduced using @('defrec').</li>

 </ul>


 <p>The @(see std::define) macro has been improved in many ways.</p>

 <ul>

 <li>It has been modified to make it easier to extend, largely in support of
 @(see std::defines).</li>

 <li>It now uses @(see with-output) to avoid printing so much output.</li>

 <li>Theorems introduced by @(see std::returns-specifiers) now often have better
 names, and the name can also be controlled using @(':name').</li>

 <li>The new @(see std::more-returns) macro allows for additional @(see
 std::returns-specifiers) style theorems after a @('define').</li>

 <li>A performance bug with the @(see std::var-is-stobj-p) function, notably
 used by @('define'), has been fixed.</li>

 <li>Experimental <i>post-define hooks</i> can allow for custom actions to be
 carried out after submitting a @('define'); such a hook allows for a tight
 integration between @('define') and the new @(see fty::fty) library.</li>

 <li>New options allow you to avoid introducing an encapsulate and to name and
 save the termination proof.</li>

 </ul>

 <p>Other macros have also been improved in various ways.</p>

 <ul>

 <li>@(see std::defredundant) tool has been expanded to better handle @(see
 mutual-recursion) and <see topic='@(url macro-aliases-table)'>macro
 aliases</see>.</li>

 <li>@(see std::defmvtypes) now has smarter handling of @(see force).</li>

 <li>@(see std::defenum) now automatically produces a fixing function and
 forward-chaining rule to give the possible values of the objects.</li>

 <li>@(see std::defrule) now has a @(':local') option.</li>

 <li>@(see std::deflist) is now smart enough to tell whether functions are
 defined; its former @(':already-definedp') option is now useless and, hence,
 deprecated.</li>

 <li>@(see std::defprojection) now uses @(see nrev::nrev) instead of optimizing
 things with @('nreverse') directly, reducing the use of trust tags.</li>

 <li>@(see std::defprojection) now accepts @(see std::define)-like syntax for
 @(see std::extended-formals) and @(see std::returns-specifiers).</li>

 <li>A bug with @(see std::defprojection)'s @('subsetp') theorem has been
 fixed.</li>

 </ul>

 <p>Many macros now have a @(':verbosep') option that can be used to disable
 output suppression.</p>

 <p>The @('std/util') testing code has been factored out into a new
 @('std/util/tests') directory.</p>



 <h5>@(see std/typed-lists)</h5>

 <p>There are now books for many built-in ACL2 list recognizers that were
 previously not covered, e.g., @(see boolean-listp), @(see integer-listp),
 etc.</p>


 <h5>@(see std/strings)</h5>

 <p>Many logical definitions throughout the @(see std/strings) library have been
 cleaned up.  Also, many definitions have been changed to use @(see std::define)
 for better documentation.</p>

 <p>The new book @('std/strings/defs-program') contains @(see program) mode
 definitions of most functions in the @('std/strings') library.</p>

 <p>The new @(see str::pretty) routine can convert arbitrary ACL2 objects into
 pretty-printed strings.  Is a fast, state-free, logic mode reimplementation of
 much of ACL2's pretty printer.</p>

 <p>There are now a much richer collection of numeric functions, especially for
 non-decimal bases; see @(see str::numbers).</p>

 <p>The string library now has a very efficient, bitset-like way to represent
 sets of characters, and some functions for working with these character
 sets. See @(see str::charset-p).</p>


 <h5>@(see std/io)</h5>

 <p>The @(see read-string) function will now produce better error messages and
 can (optionally, via raw Lisp) avoid checking @('bad-lisp-objectp'). </p>


 <h3>Defdata Changes</h3>

 <p>Defdata's output has been tweaked.</p>

 <p>The @(see defdata) library now supports range types.</p>

 <p>Counterexample generation has been updated to use tau instead of the former
 @('graph-tc') book, and has many other updates.</p>


 <h3>COI Changes</h3>

 <p>COI's @('def::signature') macro now has support for generalized
 congruences.</p>



 <h3>@(see Quicklisp) and @(see OSLIB)</h3>

 <p>The experimental @(see quicklisp) build has been updated in many ways.
 Quicklisp files are now installed under the @('centaur/quicklisp/inst')
 directory instead of the user's home directory.</p>

 <p>The Quicklisp install can be carried out using a proxy.</p>

 <p>The @(see quicklisp) books now include support for the @('bordeaux-threads')
 and @('hunchentoot') libraries.</p>

 <p>@(see oslib::getpid) has been extended to work on Lisps other than CCL.</p>

 <p>Added minimal tests to @(see oslib) functions such as @(see
 oslib::file-kind) and @(see oslib::date).</p>

 <p>OSLIB has new @(see oslib::lisp-type) and @(see oslib::lisp-version) functions.</p>

 <p>A new book, @('centaur/misc/sharedlibs'), may be useful for relocating @(see
 save-exec) images that require shared libraries for CCL/Linux systems.</p>

 <p>We have remove dependencies on @('iolib') since its build does not seem to
 be reliable.</p>


 <h2>Changes to Centaur Libraries</h2>


 <h3>@(see GL::GL) Changes</h3>

 <p>The @('rtl9') library has been updated to better support GL.</p>

 <p>GL has better @(see if) handling, and as a result may be better able to cope
 with unsatisfiable path conditions (i.e., unreachable code regions) when using
 SAT-based @(see gl::modes).</p>

 <p>New @(see gl::preferred-definitions) may slightly improve performance of
 bit-vector operations like @(see logcar), @(see logcdr), @(see loghead), and
 @(see logtail).</p>

 <p>Some symbolic arithmetic functions have been changed so as to possibly
 improve AIG performance.</p>

 <p>GL's rewrites to @(see 4v) constants have been improved.</p>

 <p>The new macro @(see gl::gl-thm) is like @(see gl::def-gl-thm), but doesn't
 store the theorem.  That is, it's like @(see thm) is to @(see defthm).
 Similarly, @(see gl::gl-param-thm) is to @(see gl::def-gl-param-thm), and @(see
 gl::def-gl-rule) is similar to @(see std::defrule).</p>

 <p>The definitions of @('def-gl-thm'), etc., have been simplified, @(see
 gl::gl-hint) can now be told which GL clause processor to use.</p>

 <p>Minor bugs have been fixed.</p>
 <ul>

 <li>GL's @(see gl::def-gl-rewrite) macro has been reworked to avoid the
 possibility of dropping rules when books are included in different orders.</li>

 <li>The GL interpreter now uses the @('clk') from the given @(see
 gl::glcp-config).</li>

 </ul>

 <p>The documentation for GL has been generally improved.</p>


 <h3>@(see VL) Verilog Toolkit</h3>

 <p>VL has been significantly refactored.  All of the internal @(see vl::syntax)
 is now based on @(see fty::fty), which is a major change.  The representation
 of @(see vl::statements) is especially different.</p>

 <p>VL is beginning to gain support for some limited SystemVerilog constructs.
 This is a major change that affects all areas, e.g., lexing, parsing, syntax,
 and transformations.</p>

 <p>VL now support certain kinds of combinational always blocks.  It also
 supports richer edge-triggered always blocks, including, e.g., registers with
 asynchronous set/reset signals.</p>

 <p>Many bugs have been fixed, some severe.  For instance, VL was incorrectly
 translating BUF, NOT, and XNOR gates with \"extra\" terminals.  The new VL
 @('systest') directory includes various end-to-end tests of VL's translations
 of certain modules.</p>

 <p>Warnings have been improved.  For instance, VL now warns about 0-bit
 replications since some Verilog tools do not implement them correctly.</p>

 <p>Many ttags have been removed from VL, using @(see nrev::nrev).</p>

 <p>VL's always/delay transforms can now optionally produce less bitblasted
 modules.</p>

 <p>The @(see vl::kit) includes new commands such as @('vl gather') and many
 commands have additional options.  It also now prints backtraces on errors for
 improved debugging.</p>

 <p>Numerous other minor bug fixes, extensions, performance improvements,
 etc.</p>


 <h3>Other Centaur Libraries</h3>

 <p>@(see satlink) now uses @('glucose-cert') instead of @('lingeling') as the
 default SAT solver.</p>

 <p>The default @(see sexpr-rewriting) rules have been expanded and improved.
 These changes may improve decomposition proofs and also the performance of
 GL-based STV proofs.</p>

 <p>@(see tshell) should now handle interrupts more reliably.</p>

 <p>The executable counterparts of @(see symbolic-test-vectors) are now disabled
 by default.</p>

 <p>There is now better support for decomposition proofs of @(see
 symbolic-test-vectors), see files such as
 @('centaur/esim/stv/stv-decomp-proofs*') and
 @('centaur/regression/composed-stv.lisp').</p>

 <p>The new @(see stv-run-for-all-dontcares) function is a less conservative
 alternative to @(see stv-run).</p>

 <p>Some lemmas have been localized in @(see esim).</p>

 <p>@(see aignet) now has a basic @('aignet-print') function for debugging.</p>

 <p>The @(see bridge::json-encoding) routines now use @(see define) for better
 documentation.</p>

 <p>Some @(see aignet) functions and @('numlist') are now tail recursive.</p>

 <p>The @(see bitops) @('ihsext-basics') book has additional rules about @(see
 lognot) and @(see logmask).</p>

 <p>Improved and documented the @(see logbitp-reasoning) hint.</p>

 <p>Added @(see bit->bool) to the @(see bitops) library.</p>

 <p>The new @('centaur/bitops/contrib') directory contains additional lemmas.</p>


 <h2>Other Changes</h2>

 <p>(File interface/emacs/inf-acl2.el) One now gets a clear error, suggesting a
 solution, when Emacs command @('meta-x run-acl2') cannot find an ACL2
 executable.  Thanks to Scott Staley for helpful correspondence leading to this
 fix.</p>

 <p>The @(see make-flag) tool now uses slightly faster, more robust hints.</p>

 <p>The @(see witness-cp) clause processor has been made more flexible.</p>

 <p>The @('clause-processors/unify-subst') and @('clause-processors/generalize')
 books have been reworked to avoid nearly duplicate definitions.</p>

 <p>The @(see def-universal-equiv) macro now takes an @('already-definedp')
 option.</p>

 <p>The @('demos/patterened-congruences.lisp') book has been improved.</p>

 <p>The book @('centaur/misc/intern-debugging') book has been modified and
 should now be generally unnecessary, thanks to CCL improvements which have
 resolved the problems it was intended to warn about.</p>

 <p>Something happened to profiling.lisp in r2423.</p>

 <p>@(see disassemble$) now supports macro aliases.</p>

 <p>Several ordinary files that were incorrectly marked as executable are now
 properly non-executable.</p>

 <p>The tau @('elementary-bounders') book has been extended with additional
 lemmas about @(see expt) for powers of 2.</p>



 <h2>Changes to ACL2(r) Books</h2>

 <p>Many explicit function definitions have been replaced with constraints, in
 order to make theorems about those functions more useful for functional
 instantiation later.  For example, instead of insisting that @('(f+g)(x)') is
 really equal to @('f(x) + g(x)'), this is now only required for valid values of
 @('x').</p>

 <p>The theory of integration is now updated to conform to the current version
 of continuity and differentiability (which allows functions that are only
 continuous or differentiable over a particular domain).</p>

 <p>The concepts of continuity, differentiability, and integration now have both
 non-standard and classical definitions.  These are shown to be equivalent for
 classical functions without parameters.  Even when parameters are present, the
 classical definitions can be used to take advantage of important theorems, such
 as the intermediate-value theorem, mean-value theorem, fundamental theorem of
 calculus, etc.</p>")


(defxdoc note-6-4-books
  :parents (note-6-4)
  :short "Release notes for the ACL2 Community Books for ACL2 6.4 (January,
 2013)."

  :long "<p>The following is a brief summary of changes made to the @(see
 community-books) between the releases of ACL2 6.3 and 6.4.  See the <a
 href='https://code.google.com/p/acl2-books/wiki/ReleaseVersionNumbers'>acl2-books
 Wiki page on ReleaseVersionNumbers</a> for svn revision numbers corresponding
 to releases.  See also @(see note-6-4) for the changes made to ACL2 itself.</p>

 <p>For additional details, you may also see the raw <a
 href='http://code.google.com/p/acl2-books/source/list'>commit log</a>.</p>


 <h3>Build System Changes</h3>

 <p>In previous versions of ACL2, the default @('make') command for building the
 Community Books could take several hours.  Starting in ACL2 6.4, the default
 build is much faster because it <b>excludes many books</b>.</p>

 <p>This particularly affects what happens when you run @('make') from the
 @('books') directory.  We have <i>not</i> changed how @('make regression')
 works from the @('acl2-sources') directory&mdash;it still builds (nearly) all
 of the books.</p>

 <p>See @(see books-certification) for details about how to use the new build
 system.</p>


 <h3>Deleted Stubs</h3>

 <p>When we move a book, we often add a <b>stub</b> book in its previous
 location to help you transition your @(see include-book) commands.  The @(see
 build::cert.pl) build system prints warnings when a stub book is being
 included.</p>

 <p>Stub books have a lifespan of one release.  The following books were stubs
 in ACL2 6.3, so we've deleted them.</p>

 <h3>Book Reorganization</h3>

 <p>We've moved several books to new homes in an effort to clean up the
 top-level @('books') directory.  Users of these libraries will need to update
 their @(see include-book) commands, and in some cases, packages may have also
 changed.</p>

 <p>The table below shows which libraries have moved and where they have moved
 to.  Books with stubs may continue to work until the next release, but you'll
 need to update your @('include-book')s eventually.</p>

 <h3>Deprecated Books</h3>

 <p>We've deleted the RTL @('rel7') and @('rel8') directories; please upgrade to
 @('rtl/rel9').  Note that @('rel8') is essentially part of @('rel9'), so if you
 can't directly upgrade to @('rel9'), you may try replacing</p>

     (include-book \"rtl/rel8/lib/top\" :dir :system)
 })

 <p>with</p>

 @({
     (include-book \"rtl/rel9/support/lib3/top\" :dir :system)
     (include-book \"rtl/rel9/arithmetic/top\" :dir :system)
 })



 <h3>Scripts Moved</h3>

 <p>We've moved many build scripts like @(see build::cert.pl), @('clean.pl'),
 and @('critpath.pl') from the top-level @('books') directory, into a new
 @('books/build') directory.  You may need to update paths to these files in
 your Makefiles or other build scripts.</p>



 <h3>Documentation Changes</h3>

 <p>The ACL2 system documentation has been extracted from the ACL2 sources,
 converted into @(see xdoc) format, and is now located in the Community Books.
 This allows for a tighter integration between the system and book
 documentation, e.g., system topics like @(see io) can now directly link to
 related libraries like @(see std/io).  See @(see note-6-4) for details; and see
 especially the file @('system/doc/acl2-doc.lisp').</p>

 <p>A new, feature-rich Emacs-based documentation browser named @(see acl2-doc)
 has been developed by Matt Kaufmann, and has many features.</p>

 <p>We've added at least some minimal @(see xdoc) documentation for several
 @(see projects): see @(see concurrent-programs), @(see des), @(see equational),
 @(see jfkr), @(see milawa), @(see paco), @(see leftist-trees), @(see
 sha-2), @(see taspi), and @(see wp-gen).</p>

 <p>We've added significant documentation for many books and utilities,
 including at least:</p>

 <ul>
 <li>@(see build::cert.pl) - a build system for certifying ACL2 books</li>
 <li>@(see defconsts) - like @('defconst') but supports stobjs, state, and multiple values</li>
 <li>@(see defrstobj) - a macro for introducing record-like stobjs</li>
 <li>@(see bitops) - an arithmetic library especially for bit-vector arithmetic</li>
 <li>@(see def-universal-equiv) - a macro for universally quantified equivalences</li>
 <li>@(see arith-equivs) - equivalence relations for naturals, integers, and bits</li>
 <li>@(see set-max-mem) - a memory management scheme for ccl</li>
 <li>@(see str::base64) - base64 string encoding/decoding</li>
 </ul>

 <p>We've made hundreds of other minor documentation improvements, and we invite
 everyone to contribute improvements.</p>
