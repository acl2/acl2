;
;  - Book release notes are typically very disorganized.  This shouldn't be
;    considered a bug until we are very close to a release.

; Starting with Version 7.3, we no longer maintain release notes
; note-x-x-books.  Instead, we hope that the ACL2 Community will track
; changes to the books by maintaining note-x-x-books as they go.

(defxdoc release-notes-books

  :short "Release notes for the ACL2 Community Books for ACL2 8.1"

  :long "<p>The following is a brief summary of changes made to the @(see
 community-books) between the releases of ACL2 8.0 and 8.1.</p>

 <p>See also @(see note-8-1) for the changes made to ACL2 itself.  For
 additional details, you may also see the raw <a
 href='https://github.com/acl2/acl2/commits/master'>commit log</a>.</p>

 <h3>New Libraries</h3>

 <p>A new regular expression library, @(see acre::acre), is available in
 @('books/centaur/acre/').  Compared to the implementation in
 @('projects/regex'), this version's features are less similar to GNU grep and
 somewhat more similar to Perl regular expressions.  However, it does not aim
 to be fully compatible, but to have a well-defined set of features with clean
 code that can be easily extended and behaves predictably (as much as possible,
 for regular expressions).</p>

 <p>Added PLTP(A), The Pure Lisp Theorem Prover, reimplemented in ACL2.  An
 ACL2 reconstruction of the 1973 Pure Lisp Theorem Prover (PLTP), the original
 ``Boyer-Moore theorem prover'' after which both NQTHM and ACL2 were modeled,
 is available in @('books/projects/pltpa/pltpa.lisp').  More importantly, a <a
 href='http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/best-ideas/pltp/index.html'>PLTP
 archive</a> has been set up.  That archive includes much original source
 material (e.g., scanned images of the 1973 POP-2 implementation of PLTP) as
 well as an extensive discussion of the differences between PLTP and PLTP(A),
 and an OCaml version of PLTP, named PLTA(O), by Grant Passmore.</p>

 <p>A new directory, @('books/projects/arm/'), contains proofs of correctness
 of the Floating-point operations of addition, multiplication, fused
 multiply-add, division, and square root, as implemented in the FPU of an Arm
 Cortex-A class high-end processor.</p>

 <p>Added utility @(see include-book-paths) to list paths via @(tsee
 include-book) down to a given book, which may be useful for reducing book
 dependencies.</p>

 <p>Added a <see topic='@(url fty)'>fixtype</see> for <see topic='@(url
 set::std/osets)'>finite sets</see>.</p>

 <p>Added utility @(see apply-fn-if-known) to apply a function that might not
 exist; even the package for the function symbol might not exist.</p>

 <p>Added utilities to fix values to @(tsee integer-range-p), as well as to
 recognize and to fix to true lists of @(tsee integer-range-p) values.</p>

 <p>Added some theorems about @(tsee nat-list-fix).</p>

 <p>Added a <see topic='@(url digits-any-base)'>library</see> to convert
 between natural numbers and their representations as lists of digits in
 arbitrary bases in big-endian and little-endian order.  Digits are natural
 numbers below the base.  There are variants for minimum-length,
 non-zero-minimum-length, and specified-length lists of digits.  The library
 includes, among others, theorems stating that the number-to-digits and
 digits-to-number conversions are mutual inverses in a suitable sense.</p>

 <p>Added a new utility, @(tsee skip-in-book), that wraps around a form to
 prevent its evaluation during book certification or inclusion.</p>

 <p>The new utility @(tsee defthm<w) will attempt to prove a theorem directly
 from previously-proved theorems.  It does this by generating suitable @(see
 hints) using the new utility, @(see previous-subsumer-hints).</p>

 <p>A new book, @('kestrel/utilities/proof-builder-macros.lisp'), is a place to
 define @(see proof-builder) macros.  This book currently defines a simple
 macro, @('when-not-proved') (see @(tsee acl2-pc::when-not-proved)), for
 skipping instructions when all goals have been proved.  It also defines two
 (more complex) macros, @('prove-guard') (see @(tsee acl2-pc::prove-guard)) and
 @('prove-termination') (see @(tsee acl2-pc::prove-termination)), for
 (respectively) using previously-proved @(see guard) or termination theorems
 efficiently, as well as a more general macro, @(tsee acl2-pc::fancy-use), for
 using lemma instances (via @(':use')) efficiently.</p>

 <p>Added some theorems to the <see topic='@(url
 character-utilities)'>character utilities</see>.</p>

 <p>Added <see topic='@(url xdoc::xdoc-constructors)'>the XDOC
 constructors</see>, which are utilities to construct well-tagged XDOC strings
 via ACL2 function calls whose nesting structure mirrors the nesting of the
 XML.</p>

 <p>Added utilities @(tsee fsublis-fn-rec), @(tsee fsublis-fn), and @(tsee
 fsublis-fn-simple), which are variants of the built-in system utilities that
 have the same names minus the initial @('f').  These variants do not perform
 simplification.  The relationship between these variants and the corresponding
 built-in system utilities is analogous to the relationship between @(tsee
 fcons-term) and @(tsee cons-term).</p>

 <p>Added a utility @(tsee all-lambdas) to collect all the lambda expressions
 in a term.</p>

 <p>Added utilities @(tsee apply-terms-same-args) and @(tsee
 fapply-terms-same-args) to apply each function in a specified list to a
 specified list of arguments.</p>

 <h3>Changes to Existing Libraries</h3>

 <p>The behavior and code for the expander (see @(see defthm?)) have been
 improved in a few ways (some of them technical), as follows.</p>

 <ul>

 <li>A bug has been fixed that was preventing @(see hints) from being passed to
 the forcing round (if any).  An example may be found in the new book,
 @('misc/expander-tests.lisp').</li>

 <li>The deprecated @(tsee fmt) directives @('~p') and @('~q') have been
 replaced by @('~x') and @('~y'), respectively.</li>

 <li>Error messages have been improved for the function @('simplify-hyps') when
 there is a contradiction.</li>

 <li>The @(see state) globals @('tool2-result') and @('tool2-error') are no
 longer set.  (They appear to have been unused.)</li>

 <li>The functions @('tool2-fn'), @('tool2-fn-lst'), and @('simplify-hyps') now
 have a new final argument, @('ctx').  Also, the macro @('tool2') now has a
 @(':ctx') keyword argument.</li>

 </ul>

 <p>Updated the ACL2+books manual to accommodate the replacement of David
 Russinoff's online rtl manual by his upcoming Springer book.</p>

 <p>Improved @(tsee install-not-normalized) to handle cases in which
 recursively-defined functions have non-recursive normalized definitions.</p>

 <p>The @('misc/assert.lisp') book no longer includes @('misc/eval.lisp'),
 since tests about the @('misc/assert.lisp') utilities are now in a separate
 book @('misc/assert-tests.lisp').</p>

 <p>The @('misc/eval.lisp') utilities @(tsee ensure-error), @(tsee
 ensure-soft-error), @(tsee ensure-hard-error), @(tsee thm?), and @(tsee
 not-thm?)  have been renamed to @(tsee must-fail-with-error), @(tsee
 must-fail-with-soft-error), @(tsee must-fail-with-hard-error), @(tsee
 must-prove), and @(tsee must-not-prove).  The old names are still available as
 deprecated synonyms, which will be removed in one of the next releases.</p>

 <p>The old directory @('books/projects/masc/') has been replaced by the bew
 directory@('books/projects/rac/').  The reason is that our RTL modeling
 language now uses the register class templates of Algorithm C instead of those
 of SystemC, so the name <i>Modeling Algorithms in SystemC</i> now makes even
 less sense than it did; the best we could come up with as a replacement is
 <i>Restricted Algorithmic C</i>. </p>

 <p>The utility @(tsee make-flag) has a new keyword argument, @(':last-body'),
 to specify using the most recent @(see definition) rule for a function symbol
 instead of its original definition.</p>

 <p>Improved the @('copy-def') utility (community book
 @('kestrel/utilities/copy-def.lisp')) by adding an @(':expand') hint in the
 recursive case, as is sometimes necessary.  Also improved it to work better
 with @(tsee mutual-recursion).</p>

 <p>Extended and simplified the <see topic='@(url
 defun-sk-queries)'>@('defun-sk') query utilities</see>.  The utilities now
 handle the recently introduced @(':constrain') option.  The utilities no
 longer build a record with all the information about the @(tsee defun-sk)
 function (whose fields can then be accessed); instead, now the utilities
 retrieve the various pieces of information directly.</p>

 <p>Extended the <see topic='@(url defchoose-queries)'>@('defchoose') query
 utilities</see> with a recognizer for symbols that name @(tsee defchoose)
 functions.</p>

 <p>Made several improvements to @(tsee directed-untranslate), including: one
 to avoid assertion errors that could occur when using @(tsee declare) forms
 with @(tsee let), @(tsee let*), or @(tsee mv-let) expressions: one to enhance
 insertion of appropriate @(tsee mv) calls; one to extend dropping of
 unused @(tsee let) bindings; and one to avoid an assertion error with
 @('mv-let') expressions.</p>

 <p>Removed the @('keywords-of-keyword-value-list') utility, because it is
 subsumed by the built-in @(tsee evens) utility.</p>

 <p>Extended the <see topic='@(url error-checking)'>error-checking
 functions</see> with some new ones.</p>

 <p>Extended the <see topic='@(url term-function-recognizers)'>term function
 recognizers</see> with recognizers for true lists of
 (pseudo-)lambda-expressions and (pseudo-)term-functions.</p>

 <p>The utility @(tsee install-not-norm-event) now includes option @(':allp
 nil') in the generated @(tsee install-not-normalized) event.  The new utility,
 @(tsee install-not-norm-event-lst), can thus handle @(tsee mutual-recursion)
 nicely, e.g.: @('(install-not-norm-event-lst (getpropc 'f1 'recursivep nil)
 nil nil (w state))').  Also, added new utility @(tsee install-not-norm) to
 submit the event generated by @(tsee install-not-norm-event).</p>

 <h4><see topic='@(url soft::soft)'>SOFT</see></h4>

 <p>Added a @(':print') option to control screen output.</p>

 <p>Improved user input validation.</p>

 <p>Added support for the new @(':constrain') option of @(tsee defun-sk).  This
 option is now supported by SOFT's @(tsee soft::defun-sk2) and @(tsee
 soft::defun-inst) macros.</p>

 <h4><see topic='@(url x86isa)'>X86ISA</see></h4>

 <p>The model includes more support for 32-bit mode.  In particular: (some
 variants of) the PUSH, POP, MOV, LEA, XCHG, CMPXCHG, ADD, ADC, SUB, SBB, OR,
 AND, XOR, NEG, NOT, CMP, TEST, MUL, IMUL, DIV, IDIV, INC with opcodes FEh-FFh,
 DEC with opcodes FEh-FFh, CBW, CWDE, CDQE, CWD, CDQ, CQO, ROL, ROR, RCL, RCR,
 SAL, SAR, SHL, SHR, BT, JMP, Jcc, JCXZ, JECXZ, JRCXZ, CMOVcc, SETcc, LOOP,
 LOOPcc, CALL, RET, CMC, CLC, STC, CLD, STD, SAHF, LAHF, RDRAND, HLT, and NOP
 instructions also work in 32-bit mode now; the 32-bit instructions PUSHA,
 POPA, INC with opcodes 40h-47h, and DEC with opcodes 48h-4Fh are now part of
 the model.</p>

 <p>Some of the XDOC documentation and some of the comments have been slightly
 expanded.</p>

 <p>The notion of programmer-level mode and system-level mode have been renamed
 to `application-level view' and `system-level view', to avoid overloading the
 word `mode', which in the x86 has a more specific meaning.  Similarly, the
 notion of page structure marking mode has been renamed `marking view'.  This
 involved renaming the @('programmer-level-mode') and
 @('page-structure-marking-mode') field of the state stobj to the shorter
 @('app-view') and @('marking-view'), and also renaming some functions and
 theorems acccordingly.</p>

 <h4><see topic='@(url apt::apt)'>APT</see></h4>

 <p>Improved documentation.</p>

 <p>Improved options to control the screen output.</p>

 <p>Improved @(tsee apt::tailrec) transformation with an option to attempt to
 automatically infer the domain for some of the transformation's applicability
 conditions.</p>

 <p>Improved @(tsee apt::restrict) transformation to wrap the restriction test
 with @(tsee mbt); added an applicability condition to ensure that the
 restriction test is boolean-valued.</p>

 <h4><see topic='@(url acl2::bitops)'>Bitops</see></h4>

 <p>Added the @(see bitops::sparseint) library, which represents large integers
 as balanced binary trees, which can save memory by sharing structure among many
 such objects.</p>

 <h4><see topic='@(url acl2::sv)'>SV</see></h4>

 <p>Improved scalability of several SV utilities when large variables are present
 by recoding several functions that previously used Lisp bignums to use a
 @(see bitops::sparseint) based encoding.</p>

 <h4><see topic='@(url acl2::xdoc)'>Xdoc</see></h4>

 <p>Added a utility, @(see xdoc::archive-xdoc), that saves the documentation
 generated by a series of local events, partially preprocessing it to avoid
 references to definitions that might only be locally available.</p>

 <p>The @('std/typed-lists/unsigned-byte-listp.lisp') book now includes
  @('std/lists/take') locally. As a result,
  @('projects/x86isa/tools/execution/exec-loaders/mach-o/mach-o-reader.lisp'),
  @('std/io/take-bytes.lisp'), @('unicode/read-utf8.lisp'), and
  @('unicode/utf8-decode.lisp') also include this book locally.</p>

 <h3>Licensing Changes</h3>

 <h3>Build System Updates</h3>

 <p>The build system now has support for @(see ifdef) and @(see ifndef), which
 are @(see make-event)-supported macros defined in @('books/build/ifdef.lisp').
 In particular, this allows the community books' makefile to support building
 different versions of the manual depending what external tools are
 installed.</p>

 <h3>Testing</h3>

 <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

 <p>A BibTeX file has been added to the community books, containing reference
 information for papers published at the ACL2 Workshops.  This may be useful to
 you if you wish to cite such a paper in a LaTeX document.  It is available at
 @('books/workshops/references/').  That directory also contains an example
 LaTeX file demonstrating how the references may be cited, as well as a README
 with some more information.</p>

 <p>A Developer's Guide (see @(see developers-guide)) has been added, to assist
 those who may wish to become ACL2 Developers.  It replaces the much smaller
 ``system-development'' topic.</p>

 <p>The @(tsee defpointer) utility for @(see xdoc) now accepts names that have
 special characters such as @('<').</p>

 <p>The download button now works in the web-based manual.</p>

  :long "<p>The following is a brief summary of changes made to the @(see
 community-books) between the releases of ACL2 7.4 and 8.0.</p>

 <p>See also @(see note-8-0) for the changes made to ACL2 itself.  For
 additional details, you may also see the raw <a
 href='https://github.com/acl2/acl2/commits/master'>commit log</a>.</p>

 <h3>New Libraries</h3>

 <h4>Supporting materials for the 2017 ACL2 Workshop</h4>

 <p>See the new directory, @('workshops/2017/') &mdash; specifically, its
 @('README') file.</p>

 <h4>SAT proof-checker for cube-and-conquer</h4>

 <p>The new directory is @('projects/sat/lrat/cube/').  See file @('README') in
 that directory.</p>

 <h4>SAT proof-checker from 2011</h4>

 <p>An early SAT proof-checker based on resolution may be found in directory
 @('books/projects/sat/zz-resolution-checker/'); see the @('README') in that
 directory.  It was sufficiently efficient to get limited use in industry, but
 ultimately was superseded by much more efficient clause-based
 proof-checking (see directory @('books/projects/sat/lrat/')).</p>

 <h4>EDIF conversion</h4>

 <p>See @('projects/async/tools/convert-edif.lisp') for tools to convert
 between EDIF format and corresponding convenient s-expressions.</p>

 <h4>try-gl-concls</h4>

 <p>See @(see try-gl-concls) for a small but convenient utility to
 find all the true conclusions (if any) from a user-provided list of
 possible conclusions using @(see GL::GL).</p>

 <h4>GLMC</h4>

 <p>GLMC (in directory @('centaur/glmc')) is a connection from ACL2 to
 AIG-based hardware model checkers, via @(see gl::gl); this can be used to
 prove safety properties without finding an inductive invariant.  See @(see
 gl::glmc) for details.</p>

 <h4>Truth</h4>

 <p>Directory @('centaur/truth') contains a library for using integers as a
 representation for Boolean functions with small (single-digit) numbers of
 variables, expressing the functions as truth tables.  Truth tables for 5 or
 fewer variables are especially efficient since the formulas are represented as
 fixnums (at least in 64-bit lisps).</p>

 <h4>Ipasir</h4>

 <p>The @(see ipasir::ipasir) library (in directory @('centaur/ipasir'))
 contains an axiomatized interface for using incremental SAT solver libraries in
 ACL2.  A solver object is represented as an abstract stobj, and actual solver
 functions from a suitable shared library can be called as the implementation.
 Integration with @(see aignet::aignet) is also provided in the book
 @('centaur/aignet/ipasir').</p>

 <h4>ABNF</h4>

 <p>The <see topic='@(url abnf::abnf)'>ABNF (Augmented Backus-Naur Form)
 library</see> provides (1) a formalization of the syntax and semantics of the
 ABNF notation, (2) a verified parser that turns ABNF grammar text (e.g. from
 the HTTP RFC) into a formal representation suitable for formal
 specification (e.g. for HTTP parsing), and (3) executable operations on ABNF
 grammars, e.g.  to check their well-formedness and to compose them.</p>

 <h4>APT</h4>

 <p>The <see topic='@(url apt::apt)'>APT (Automated Program Transformations)
 library</see> provides tools to transform programs and program specifications
 with automated support.</p>

 <h3>Changes to Existing Libraries</h3>

 <h4>@(see std/io)</h4>

 <p>The @(see std/io) library now contains lemmas to help users prove
 that opened input and output channels remain open until closed, to
 aid guard theorem proofs.  See @(see open-channel-lemmas).</p>

 <h4>Miscellaneous @(see std) changes</h4>

 <p>The @('why') and @('why-explain') convenience macros in
 @('std/std-customization.lsp') now support rule classes other than
 @(':rewrite').</p>

 <p>The rule @('sets-are-true-lists') has been split into three rules with the
 same formula: a disabled @(see rewrite) rule of that name, a (@see
 compound-recognizer) rule @('sets-are-true-lists-compound-recognizer'), and a
 rewrite rule @('sets-are-true-lists-cheap') whose @(see backchain-limit) is
 1.</p>

 <p>A new utility @('def-updater-independence-thm') for proving stobj (and
 stobj-style) accessors independent of updaters has been added to
 @('std/stobjs/updater-independence.lisp').</p>

 <h4>Kestrel Utilities</h4>

 <p>The <see topic='@(url kestrel-utilities)'>Kestrel Utilities</see> have
 undergone several improvements and extensions.</p>

 <p>Improved an error message for @('verify-guards-program') (thanks to Eric
 Smith for feedback); see
 @('kestrel/utilities/verify-guards-program.lisp').</p>

 <p>Added utilities @(tsee trans-eval-state) and @(tsee
 trans-eval-error-triple), which provide convenient interfaces to the ACL2
 evaluator, @(tsee trans-eval).</p>

 <p>Improved the utility, @(tsee directed-untranslate), especially for handling
 @(tsee let) and @(tsee mv-let) expressions (and @('lambda') expressions) and
 towards ensuring executability of its results.</p>

 <p>Improved the utility, @('copy-def'), to avoid failures for some functions
 defined by @(tsee mutual-recursion).  Thanks to Eric Smith for a helpful bug
 report.</p>

 <p>Added utility @(tsee er-soft+) for producing soft errors with @(':')@(tsee
 logic) mode code, returning a specified @(see error-triple).  The new utility
 @(tsee er-soft-logic) is similar but a bit simpler, for use when the only
 property needed of the returned @(see error-triple) is that its error
 component is not @('nil').</p>

 <p>Added utility @(tsee manage-screen-output) which is an improved version of
 @(tsee control-screen-output) (which may eventually be removed).  Added
 utilities @(tsee make-event-terse), @(tsee restore-output), @(tsee
 restore-output?), @(tsee fail-event), and @(tsee try-event) to fine-tune
 screen output in event-generating macros.  Moved obsolete utility
 @('control-screen-output-and-maybe-replay') to Workshop supporting materials,
 where the only remaining use of this utility was.</p>

 <p>The new utility @(tsee orelse) arranges to evaluate an event and, if that
 fails, then to evaluate a second event.</p>

 <p>The applicability condition utilities have been replaced with the <see
 topic='@(url named-formulas)'>named formula utilities</see>, which are
 slightly more general and include a few improvements.</p>

 <p>New <see topic='@(url paired-names)'>paired name utilities</see> have been
 added, to construct names consisting of two names separated by a global
 customizable separator.</p>

 <p>A new @(tsee add-const-to-untranslate-preprocess) utility has been added
 that extend @(tsee untranslate-preprocess) to keep a constant unexpanded in
 output.</p>

 <p>New @(see error-checking) utilities have been added that check conditions
 on data (e.g. user input) and provide informative and consistent error
 messages. These utilities include a macro @(tsee def-error-checker) to
 concisely define error-checking functions.</p>

 <p>A new macro @(tsee defbyte) has been added that introduces <see
 topic='@(url fty)'>fixtypes</see> for signed or unsigned bytes of specified
 sizes. Several instances of applications of this macro for common sizes of
 both signed and unsigned bytes is also provided.</p>

 <p>Utilities @(tsee doublets-to-alist) and @(tsee keyword-value-list-to-alist)
 have been added that convert lists of doublets and keyword-value lists to
 corresponding alists.</p>

 <p>A utility @(tsee assert?) has been added that is a variant of @(tsee
 assert$) with customizable context and message.</p>

 <p>The @(tsee integers-from-to) utility now has a logical definition that is
 easier to reason about than its tail-recursive definition for execution (which
 has not changed).</p>

 <p>The <see topic='@(url world-queries)'>world query</see>, <see topic='@(url
 term-utilities)'>term</see>, <see topic='@(url
 string-utilities)'>string</see>, and <see topic='@(url
 character-utilities)'>character</see> utilities have undergone several
 improvements and extensions.</p>

 <p>A few <see topic='@(url theorems-about-world-related-functions)'>theorems
 about world-related functions</see> and <see topic='@(url
 theorems-about-lists)'>theorems about lists</see> have been added.</p>

 <p>A new @(see logic)-mode utility, @(tsee magic-macroexpand), performs
 macroexpansion when all macros to be expanded are in logic mode.</p>

 <p>There is a new @(see symbol-utilities) book (initially with a single
 function, @(tsee symbol-package-name-safe)).</p>

 <h4>The apply books</h4>

 <p>Updated books pertaining to @('apply$'); see @('projects/apply-model/') and
 @('projects/apply/').</p>

 <h4>SAT proof-checker</h4>

 <p>Additions and improvements have been made to the SAT proof-checker
 directories, under @('projects/sat/lrat/').  In particular, the proof was
 completed for the incremental checker (subdirectory @('incremental/') with an
 improved soundness theorem; a new directory was addded (@('cube/'), as
 mentioned above); and renamed subdirectory @('main/') to @('sorted/').  The
 key subdirectory is @('incremental/'); a new top-level book @('top.lisp')
 includes the top-level book in that subdirectory.</p>

 <h4>Aignet library</h4>

 <p>A few new verified <see topic='@(url aignet::aignet-comb-transforms)'>
 combinational logic transforms</see> have been
 added to aignet, most notably <see topic='@(url aignet::fraig)'>fraiging</see>,
 DAG-aware <see topic='@(url aignet::rewrite)'>rewriting</see>, and
 DAG-aware and-tree <see topic='@(url aignet::balance)'>balancing</see>.
 These can be used as preprocessors for SAT solving with GL via @(see
 gl::gl-simplify-satlink-mode).</p>

 <h4>VL/SV libraries</h4>

 <ul>

 <li>SystemVerilog @('unique case') and @('unique0 case') can now optionally be
 treated differently from regular @('case') statements: either a constraint may
 be generated off to the side expressing the one-hot constraint, or logic may be
 added that assigns @('X') instead of the stated values when the one-hot constraint
 is violated.</li>

 <li>Somewhat similarly, @('enum') type variables may optionally either
 generate constraints stating that they take proper enum values, or may generate
 extra logic that forces them to @('X') when assigned an improper value.</li>

 <li>When composing together 0-delay update functions, if bit-level
 combinational loops are present, these are composed together to a fixpoint.</li>

 <li>@(see Vl::vl-lint) has yet another use-set check, @(see vl::vl-design-sv-use-set),
 which uses SV's interpretation of SystemVerilog semantics to more exactly
 analyze the usage and updates of module variables.  The previous @(see vl::Lucid)
 use-set check is still useful since sv-use-set only checks variables, not
 parameters, functions, types, etc., and also does not analyze variables local
 to procedural code blocks.</li>

 </ul>

 <h4>SOFT</h4>

 <p>The <see topic='@(url soft::soft)'>SOFT (Second-Order Functions and
 Theorems) library</see> has been improved in several ways. The @(':thm-name')
 option is now fully supported for second-order quantifier functions and their
 instances.  The treatment of user inputs is more robust. The user interface is
 more terse. The implementation is more streamlined. A more comprehensive test
 suite now exists.</p>

 <h4>X86ISA</h4>

 <ul>

 <li>The <see topic='@(url x86isa)'>X86ISA</see> has been slightly extended with
 infrastructure to support 32-bit mode of operation; in particular, the
 @('64-bit-modep') predicate is no longer always true. Some documentation
 topics and some comments have been expanded and clarified. Some exceptions are
 now being added to the fault field of the x86 state rather than the
 model-specific field. A complete model of segment address translation has been
 added.</li>

 <li>Codewalker can now be used to reason about 64-bit user-level x86
 programs --- see
 @('books/projects/x86isa/proofs/codewalker-examples') for demos.</li>

 <li>Memory functions do not traffic in lists anymore.  Instead of a
 list of canonical addresses, a contiguous linear memory region is now
 specified by: @('<n, lin-addr>'), where @('n') is the number of bytes
 to be read or written and @('lin-addr') is the first address of the
 memory region.</li>

 <li>In the programmer-level mode, disjointness of memory regions can
 be conveniently expressed using a function called @('separate').  All
 the proofs in the programmer-level mode have been updated to use this
 paradigm.</li>

 </ul>

 <h4>AVR ISA</h4>
 <p>Julien Schmaltz and Peter Schwabes' AVR ISA model has been contributed in book
 @('projects/avr-isa').</p>

 <h4>Miscellaneous Books</h4>

 <p>The book @('clause-processors/use-by-hint') now contains an additional
 utility, @(see use-termhint), that helps structure hints in a way that
 coincides with the structure of a proof and allows hints to contain terms that
 have been simplified along with the goal.</p>

 <p>A new book @('tools/symlet') introduces a macro @('let-syms') and @('b*')
 binder @('symlet') that simply replace occurrences of some symbols with some
 corresponding terms in the enclosed term.  Like Common Lisp's
 @('symbol-macrolet') but much less smart.</p>

 <p>Fixed @('misc/profiling.lisp') for newer distributions of CCL (Clozure
 Common Lisp), both from SVN and from GitHub.</p>

 <p>The macro @(tsee defconsts) now provides a better error message when given
 a symbol that does not have the syntax of a constant.</p>

 <p>The macro @(tsee must-fail) has a new keyword option, @(':expected'), to
 indicate the kind of error that is expected.  New macros @(tsee
 ensure-soft-error), @(tsee ensure-hard-error), and @(tsee ensure-error)
 provide nice interfaces to @('must-fail') with the legal values of this new
 option.  See @(see must-fail).  Thanks to Eric Smith for discussions leading
 to these changes.</p>

 <p>Modified @(tsee removable-runes) to allow a multiplier greater than 1.
 Modified output accordingly.  Also, the multiplier @('m') now provides
 non-strict bounds @('(floor (* m steps) 1)') rather than the previous
 strict bound @('(1- (ceiling (* m steps) 1))').  Moreover, a related new utility,
 @(tsee minimal-runes), returns a list of runes to enable that is sufficient
 for admitting the event.</p>

 <h3>Licensing Changes</h3>

 <h3>Build System Updates</h3>

 <p>Improved books cleaning slightly, in @('books/GNUmakefile').</p>

 <p>By default, the @(''make'') targets for certifying books now include the
 books that depend on quicklisp, except when the host Lisp is GCL.  Specify
 @('USE_QUICKLISP=0') if that is not what you want.</p>

 <p>Improved @('books/GNUmakefile') so that by default, it reports an error
 when the @('bash') shell is missing.  (Note that a version of @('sh') on a
 FreeBSD machine caused an error.)</p>

 <p>Also see @(see note-8-0), specifically the section on ``Changes at the
 System Level''.</p>

 <h3>Testing</h3>

 <p>The documentation topics for testing have been reorganized, with
 introduction of a new topic, @(see kestrel-testing-utilities), as a parent of
 the testing utilities that are part of the @(see kestrel-books), so that now
 the topic @(see testing-utilities) is the top-level topic for the testing
 utilities.</p>

 <p>The Kestrel Testing Utilities have been integrated with similar testing
 utilities under @('[books]/misc').  The utilities in
 @('kestrel/utilities/testing.lisp') have been added to @('misc/eval.lisp') and
 @('misc/assert.lisp'), and the tests in
 @('kestrel/utilities/testing-tests.lisp') have been moved into two new files
 @('misc/eval-test.lisp') and @('misc/assert-tests.lisp').</p>

 <p>The utility @(tsee run-script) supports testing of evaluation of the forms
 in a given file, to check that the output is as expected.  So far, several
 existing scripts have been adapted to take advantage of this utility:</p>

 <ul>

 <li>@('books/demos/mini-proveall-input.lsp') &mdash; a long-standing, small
 basic test of ACL2</li>

 <li>@('books/demos/marktoberdorf-08/') &mdash; based on material originally
 presented by J Moore in 2008 at the Marktoberdorf Summer School; see the
 @('README') file in that directory</li>

 <li>@('books/demos/big-proof-talks/') &mdash; based on material about ACL2
 presented by J Moore on July 6 and 7, 2017, at the <a
 href='https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/bpr'>Big Proof workshop</a>; see the
 @('README') file in that directory</li>

 <li>@('books/projects/paco/books/proveall-input.lsp'), formerly named
 @('proveall.lsp')</li>

 </ul>

 <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

 <p>Added file @('system/to-do.txt') to list some potential developer
 tasks.</p>

 <p>Fixed a bug in the package redefinition utility in community book
 @('books/misc/redef-pkg.lisp').</p>

 <p>Defined a constant @(tsee *acl2-system-exports*) that extends @(tsee
 *acl2-exports*) for system programmers.</p>

(defxdoc note-7-2-books

; Shilpi Goel
; A note on how I prepared :doc note-7-2-books
;
; Of course, the easiest (and the fairest?) way to prepare the books
; release notes is for everyone to update them the way Matt updates the
; ACL2 release notes --- as and when updates are made.  But we all don't
; do that.
;
; In this note, I've mentioned some useful git filtering commands that
; I used to sift through the commit messages. Please feel free to add
; suggestions, advice, etc. or delete this note altogether.

; Actually, this wasn't too bad to do, considering the huge amount of
; work that was done in the community between 7.1 and 7.2 releases. It
; took me about six hours, in two 3 hour increments. Note though that
; note-7-2-vl was prepared by Jared Davis.
;
; # Get a commit log from the date of last release onwards; in this
;   case, the date was May 5, 2015.
;
; > git log --since="May 5, 2015" --no-merges > note-7-2-books-raw.txt
;
; # Get a list of all authors that contributed during this period:
;
; > fgrep "Author:" note-7-2-books-raw.txt | sort | uniq
;
; # Separate out commit messages by author --- the assumption is that an
;   author will usually work on the same corpus of books and it'll be
;   easier to consolidate commmits made to them.
;
; > git log --since="May 5, 2015" --no-merges --author=shigoel > shigoel.txt
;
;   and so on for every author in the list above.
;
; # Check if any commits were missed out during this separation of
;   commits by authors: the outputs of the following two commands must
;   be the same. Note that the second command assumes that the only
;   *.txt files in the current directory are those created during this
;   process.
;
; > fgrep "Author:" note-7-2-books-raw.txt | wc -l
;
; > fgrep "Author:" --exclude=note-7-2-books-raw.txt *.txt | wc -l
;
; # Look in [books]/system/doc/acl2-doc.lisp (the book where users are
;   free to contribute documentation) for clues about where the books
;   release notes must be placed. For 7.2 release (and for others before
;   it till 6.4 release), this is in [books]/doc/relnotes.lisp, as is
;   noted in *acl2-broken-links-alist*.
;
; # Start writing the release notes by going over the author-specific
;   text files.
;
;   - I mentioned the authors of "New Libraries" but I did not mention
;     the names of those who made changes to existing libraries, unless
;     their contribution was "overwhelming" or "total" in some
;     way. E.g., Dmitry Nadezhin made considerable changes to the RTL
;     books between 7.1 and 7.2 and so I've mentioned his name in the
;     release notes under RTL.
;
;   - In case a commit message is unhelpful in determining whether that
;     commit is weighty enough to warrant a mention in the release
;     notes, it can be useful to get a list of files changed by an
;     author along with the commit SHA and date.
;
;     > git log --since="May 5, 2015" --no-merges --stat --author="Foo"
;
;   - It can also help to read discussions on closed pull requests and
;     steal stuff from there (see
;     https://github.com/acl2/acl2/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed). You can
;     choose to filter the pull requests by author, term, etc., and even
;     sort them.
;
;   - If you want to go crazy and do a thoroughly good job, you can
;     examine the patch introduced at each commit. You might want to
;     redirect the output to a temp file for the following command.
;
;     > git log --since="May 5, 2015" --no-merges -p --author="Foo"
;
;   - Sometimes, it can be helpful to see whether a new file was added
;     in a commit or merely modified. Use --name-status for that.
;
;     > git log --since="May 5, 2015" --no-merges --author="Foo" --name-status
;
;   - To see the history of a particular file:

 <h3>New Libraries</h3>

<h4>@(see kestrel-books)</h4>

 <p>Kestrel Institute's contributions are now available under
 @('kestrel/') directory. This directory contains some system
 utilities to complement the built-in @(see system-utilities). It also
 includes some general utilities to build and execute tests, retrieve
 constituents of ACL2 events like @(see defun-sk), etc.</p>

 <h4>Modeling Algorithms in SystemC and ACL2</h4>

 <p>David Russinoff has contributed a library, @('projects/masc/'),
 for modeling algorithms in SystemC and ACL2.</p>

 <h4>SOFT</h4>

 Functions and Theorems) that mimics second-order behavior. See
 @('tools/soft.lisp').</p>

 <h4>stateman</h4>

 <p>J Strother Moore's @('stateman') books are located in
 @('projects/stateman/'). @('Stateman') is a utility that uses
 metafunctions to manage large terms tepresenting machine states.</p>

 <h4>@(see sv)</h4>

 <p>SV is a new hardware verification library from Centaur Technology
that includes a vector-based expression representation, efficient
symbolic simulation integrated with @(see gl), and support for many
SystemVerilog features.  It replaces @(see esim) as a backend to @(see
vl); see @(see sv::sv-versus-esim) for a comparison.</p>

 <h4>@(see x86isa)</h4>

 <p>Shilpi Goel, Warren A. Hunt, Jr., and Matt Kaufmann have
 contributed a library, @('projects/x86isa/'), containing the
 specification of the x86 instruction set architecture and utilities
 to simulate and reason about x86 machine code.</p>

 <h4>Other new books</h4>

 <p>A toy cache coherency protocol called VI and its proof of
  correctness have been contributed by Ben Selfridge and David Rager
  in @('projects/cache-coherence/'). This effort takes an approach
  that starts with a goal invariant and develops many helper
  invariants while trying to prove this goal invariant.</p>

 <p>David Russinoff has contributed a proof of the group axioms for
 the addition operation on the elliptic curve known as
 @('Curve25519'); these books can be found in
 @('projects/curve25519/'). Another library in @('projects/shnf')
 contains a formalization of the theory of sparse Horner normal forms
 for integer polynomials.</p>

 <p>Ben Selfridge has contributed his library @('projects/sb-machine')
 that contains a formalization of the x86-TSO memory model. This model
 contains a machine with multiple processors, a shared memory, and
 store buffers.</p>

 <p>The book @('demos/meta-wf-guarantee-example.lisp') has an example
 that demonstrates the use of @(':well-formedness-guarantee') for
 @(see meta) rules</p>

 <p>The book @('misc/install-not-normalized.lisp') installs an
 unnormalized definition; see @(see install-not-normalized).</p>

 <p>The book @('hints/hint-wrapper.lisp') allows you to supply hints
 in the statement of a theorem; see @(see hint-wrapper).</p>

 <p>@('system/event-names.lisp') defines @(see ep) and @(see ep-) to
  return the list of event names (resp., excluding those events built
  into ACL2) with a given case-insensitive prefix.</p>

 <p>@('system/termp.lisp') contains work done to verify the guards of
  the ACL2 built-in function @(see termp).</p>

 <p>A new book @('tools/flag.lisp') creates a flag-based induction
 scheme for a mutual recursion; see @(see make-flag).</p>

 <p>New timing tools like @(see oracle-time) and @('oracle-timelimit')
 in @('tools/oracle-time.lisp') provide the run time and bytes
 allocated during the execution of a form.</p>

 <p>A new book @('tools/removable-runes.lisp') automatically computes
    runes to disable in order to speed up a proof. See @(see
    removable-runes).</p>

 <h4>Libraries in @('workshops/2015/')</h4>

 <p>Supporting materials for some accepted papers in the <a
 href='https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-2015/'>ACL2
 Workshop, 2015</a> can be found in the directory
 @('workshops/2015/').</p>

 <ul>

 <li>Cuong Chau, Matt Kaufmann, and Warren Hunt contributed their
 books on Fourier Series Formalization in ACL2(r) in subdirectory
 @('chau-kaufmann-hunt/').</li>

 <li>David Hardin contributed his books involving reasoning about LLVM
 code using Codewalker in the subdirectory @('hardin/').</li>

 <li>Panagiotis Manolios and Mitesh Jain submitted their work on
 proving skipping refinement with ACL2s in the subdirectory
 @('jain-manolios/').</li>

 <li>Yan Peng and Mark Greenstreet contributed their libraries to
 extend ACL2 with SMT solvers using SMTLINK in the subdirectory
 @('peng-greenstreet/').</li>

 </ul>

 <h3>Changes to Existing Libraries</h3>

 <h4>@(see ACL2-sedan) related books</h4>

 <p>The book @('acl2s/defdata/defdata-attach.lisp'), which is used to
 attach or modify metadata for a @(see defdata) type, now truely uses
 defattach for enumerators, i.e., enumerators have constant names that
 can be attached to different enumerator functions. This facility thus
 deprecates enum/test and separate test-enumerators. For now, most
 enumerators are in @(see program) mode and non-guard-verified, and
 hence, defattaching them requires trust-tags.</p>

 <p>The @(see cgen) books have been updated as follows:</p>

 <ul>

 <li>Support has been added for collecting statistics on which
    hypotheses are failing in vacuous tests.</li>

 <li>First-class support (e.g., for equality) has been added for
    membership relation/constraint, i.e., member/enum has the same
    status as range types.</li>

 <li>Nested testable events like @('thm'), @('defthm'), etc. are not
    supported anymore. This results in the simplification of the
    @('event-stack') global to just a @('event-ctx') global, which
    stores the @('ctx-form'). This simplification also allows us to
    aim for a global timeout on cgen/testing thm/defthm forms.</li>

 <li>Support for complex-rationals has been added in number
    ranges.</li>

 </ul>

 <p>The @(see acl2s::defunc) books have been udpated as follows:</p>

 <ul>

  <li>The @('print-summary') event prints total time taken by
    @('defunc') events.  Now time is only printed twice, once for
    @('test?') and once for @('defunc') logical events. Both these
    times are computed using @(see read-run-time) ACL2 function and is
    the accurate run time (not wall-clock time).</li>

  <li>A new timeout abort event is inserted at the beginning of the
    defunc/static/non-static events set (generated by
    @('defunc-events-with-staticp-flag') function) . This event checks
    if the elapsed time has exceeded the timeout limit and if it has,
    then it aborts with an error and thus we fall through the outer
    @(':OR') to the next choice.</li>

  <li>The @('program-mode-p') predicate function now checks the
   following: Is there a program-mode sub-function in the body?</li>

  <li>The @('cgen-timeout') parameter is used to restrict time spent
   by all the body contract testing as a global timeout.</li>

 </ul>

 <h4>@(see b*)</h4>

 <p>The syntax for FUN binders @(see patbind-fun) has been extended to
    allow inline/notinline declarations on the resulting @('FLET')
    forms.</p>

 <p>@('b*') now requires that variables be bound to a form and it will
 no longer treat @('nil') and @('t') as aliases for @('&'). Error
 messages produced by @('b*') have been made more informative.</p>

 <h4>@(see bitops)</h4>

 <p> Reduction XOR related functions have been added to the
 @('bitops') library in @(see bitops::parity). Lemmas in @(see
 bitops::bitops/ihsext-basics) have been cleaned up. Theorems about
 @(see unsigned-byte-p) have been added for @(see
 bitops::rotate-right) and @(see bitops::rotate-left).</p>

 <p>A small book about @(see floor) has been added:
 @('centaur/bitops/floor.lisp').</p>

 <p>More slice and merge functions have been added in @(see
 bitops::bitops/merge). Some @(see integer-length) rules in
 @('centaur/bitops/integer-length.lisp') have been changed to allow
 better free variable matching.</p>

 <h4>coi</h4>

 <p>A new book for reasoning about modular arithmetic using @('nary')
 congruences has been contributed; see
 @('coi/nary/nary-mod.lisp').</p>

 <p>Books in @('coi') have been updated so as to avoid name conflicts
 with @('std') books.</p>

 <h4>@(see fty)</h4>

 <p>The @('fty') books have been re-organized --- @('deftypes.lisp')
 has been split up into different files, and tests have been moved to
 a subdirectory @('tests/'). Performance problems with certain macros,
 mostly related to reasoning about tag and kind functions, have been
 fixed.</p>

 <p>@(see fty::deftranssum) has been extended to support nested @(see
 fty::defprod)s.</p>

 <h4>@(see quicklisp)</h4>

 <p>The bundled quicklisp libraries have been updated.  The quicklisp
books work only for ACL2 built on CCL or SBCL.</p>

 <h4>@(see rtl)</h4>

 <p>The @('rtl/rel11') books have seen many updates, courtesy of
 Dmitry Nadezhin.</p>

 <p>Guards have been added to functions in
 @('rtl/rel11/lib/'). General cleanup of the @('rtl/rel11/') books,
 like removing unnecessary hypotheses and @(see include-book)s, has
 also been done.</p>

 <p>New radix-aware versions of functions in @('rtl/rel11/support/')
 directory have been added. E.g., the old function @('bitn') has a
 fixed radix of 2 and takes @('x') and @('n') as input arguments and
 the new radix-aware version corresponding to this function is
 @('digitn'), which takes the radix @('b') in addition to @('x') and
 @('n') as inputs.</p>

 <p>The books @('rtl/rel11/support/basic.lisp'),
 @('rtl/rel11/support/bits.lisp'),
 @('rtl/rel11/support/float.lisp'),
 @('rtl/rel11/support/reps.lisp'), and
 @('rtl/rel11/support/masc.lisp') are now certifiable by ACL2(r).</p>

 <p>Some books from @('rtl/rel11/rel9-rtl-pkg/lib'), like
 @('reps.lisp'), @('rom-helpers.lisp'), and
 @('simple-loop-helpers.lisp'), along with their supporters, have been
 moved to @('rtl/rel11/support/').</p>

 <p>Bugs in @('rtl/rel11/lib/excps.lisp') related to divide-by-zero
 exception and the @('ep') exponent width in the function
 @('convert-nan-to-op') have been fixed.</p>

 <h4>@(see std)</h4>

 <p>A new macro called @(see impliez) has been added in
 @('std/basic/defs.lisp'). This macro expands to an @(see if), so
 unlike @(see implies), guards in the consequent can be verified
 assuming the antecedent.</p>

 <p>New theorems about @(see acl2-count) and @(see nth) have been
 added to @('std/lists/nth.lisp').</p>

 <p>The guards of @(see list-equiv) in @('std/lists/list-defuns.lisp')
 have been verified. The function @(see list-fix) was tweaked so that
 it avoids consing if its input is indeed a @('true-listp'). A new
 function @(see llist-fix), which is logically @('list-fix') but is
 the identity function for execution, has been also added.</p>

 <p>A possibly better non-CCL raw Lisp implementation of @(see
 bitsets::bignum-extract) has been added.</p>

 <p>A new rule @('pick-a-point-subset-constraint-helper') was added in
    @('std/osets') to allow pick-a-point proofs to be used even when
    subset is disabled.</p>

 <p>For @(see std::define), @('defretd') has been added to go with
 @(see std::defret). Also, @('defret') now allows the @('otf-flg')
 flag. @(':guard t') declarations in @('define') have been eliminated
 if guards have already been provided. Also, information displayed by
 @(see pe) of functions introduced using @('define') has been cleaned
 up using @(see pe-table).</p>

 <p>A new macro @(see std::rule) is a @('THM')-like version of @(see
 std::defrule).  @('Rule') and @('defrule') produce leaner output now,
 almost identical to that produced by @('thm') and @('defthm').</p>

 <h4>@(see vl)</h4>

 <p>For details about changes made to VL, see @(see note-7-2-vl).</p>

 <h4>@(see xdoc)</h4>

 <p>Topics with missing parents are now placed under a new topic @(see
 xdoc::missing-parents) instead of under @('top').</p>

 <p>The title of xdoc manuals can be easily configured by editing
 @('xdoc/fancy/config.js'). No warning about a redefined topic is
 produced when the topic is identical to the original one.</p>

 <p>@('xdoc') now loads @('acl2-doc-wrap') instead of @('acl2-doc') so
 that the loaded documentation doesn't overwrite the user's
 topics.</p>

 <p>A bug in @('see') that did not allow properly escaping the printed
 name of a symbol has been fixed. The implementation of @(see
 xdoc::defsection) had another bug that caused 'Definitions and
 Theorems' section to be added to topics even when there were no
 definitions or theorems in that section; this bug has been fixed as
 well. Also, @('defsection') does not explicitly turn on error
 printing during event submission anymore.</p>

 <p>The output from @(see xdoc::save) now shows more timing
 information.</p>

 <p>Legacy stuff like @('write-acl2-xdoc'), @(':import') option with
 @(see xdoc::save), and @('xdoc-verbose') has been removed.</p>

 <h4>Other Libraries</h4>

 <p>A new book @('projects/codewalker/demo-fact-partial.lisp') is a
 variant of @('projects/codewalker/demo-fact.lisp') that provides a
 guide to how Codewalker might be modified so that termination proofs
 can be avoided or delayed.</p>

 <p>Multiple values and stobjs are now supported in the
 @('coi/defung/') libraries.</p>

 <p>@(see Must-fail) and related utilities in @('misc/eval.lisp')
 produce much less output by default. Also,
 @('make-event/eval-check.lisp') no longer duplicates code from
 @('misc/eval.lisp').  Instead, it defines @('!') utilities that
 behave like the counterparts previously defined (without the @('!')
 suffix).</p>

 <p>A bug in @(see remove-hyps) that occurred when no proof steps are
 required in a proof has been fixed.</p>

 <p>A new @('tarai-measure') has been added in
 @('coi/termination/assuming/complex.lisp'), which is allows this book
 to certify quickly in ACL2(r) as well. Consequently, this book was
 removed from @('SLOW_BOOKS') in @('books/GNUmakefile').</p>

 <p>Some floating-point support has been added to the JVM M5 model;
 see @('models/jvm/m5/m5.lisp').</p>

 <p>@(see GL) now displays a more informative error message about
 duplicated indices in @(':g-bindings').</p>

 <p>@(see Satlink) now uses @('drat-trim'), available at
 @('tools/drat-trim/'), instead of @('drup-trim').</p>

 <p>The book @('tools/untranslate-for-exec.lisp') has been improved to
 handle nested mv-lets.</p>

 <h4>Deleted Books and Stubs</h4>

 <p>The book @('defexec/other-apps/records/records-bsd.lisp') has been
 deleted --- it was out of sync with @('records.lisp') in the same
 directory.</p>

 <p>The book @('make-event/assert-check-include-1.lisp') has been
 deleted.</p>

 <p>The book @('misc/dead-events.lisp') has been moved to
 @('tools/dead-events.lisp'), and a relocation stub has been added in
 the older location.</p>

 <p>In the directory @('misc/'), @('*-bsd.lisp') books are now
 @('reloc_stub') books.</p>

 <p>Books in @('projects/concurrent-programs/german-protocol/') have
 been moved to @('projects/cache-coherence/german-protocol/').</p>

 <p>The @('rtl/rel10') has been removed from the community
 books. These books were not in use anywhere in the contributed
 books.</p>

 <p>The book @('system/gather-dcls.lisp') has been deleted after its
 contents were moved to
 @('system/verified-termination-and-guards.lisp').</p>

 <h3>Licensing Changes</h3>

 <p>The following books now have BSD-3-Clause license.</p>

 <ul>

 <li>@('arithmetic-2/') and @('arithmetic-3/')</li>

 <li>@('misc/rtl-untranslate.lisp')</li>

 <li>M5 books @('models/jvm/m5/')</li>

 <li>@('rtl') books</li>

 <li>@('system/cantor-pairing-bijective.lisp')</li>

 <li>@('tools/with-arith5-help.lisp')</li>

 </ul>

 <h3>Build System Updates</h3>

 <h4>@(see build::cert.pl)</h4>

 <p>The @('cert.pl') documentation at @('build/doc.lisp') has been
 moved to its own @('BUILD') package.</p>

 <p>@('cert.pl') now produces successful certification messages that
 include times and color coding.  @('cert.pl') has also been patched
 to correctly handle filenames with dollar signs. It has new options
 for removing @('.cert.out') files after successful certifications and
 for sending them to a temporary directory.</p>

 <p>A new @(see build::cert_param) for SMTLINK, @('uses-smtlink'), has
    been added so that books using it will not be certified unless
    supporting software such as Z3 is installed. Another
    @('cert_param') called @('non-gcl') has been added.</p>

 <p>A new @('CERT_PL_SHOW_HOSTNAME') environment variable has been
 added to @('cert.pl') that can show the hostname after each book gets
 certified.</p>

 <h4>make system</h4>

 <p>The topic @(see Books-certification) gives clearer instructions on
 building the books and the manual.</p>

 <ul>

 <li>@('make manual') now just builds @('doc/top.cert') and
 @('system/doc/acl2-manual.cert').</li>

 <li>@('make everything') now just depends on all the books it was
 going to build.</li>

 <li>@('make quicklisp') now just causes an error if
 @('USE_QUICKLISP') is not set.</li>

 </ul>

 <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

 <p>A new tool @('build/memsum.pl') analyzes memory usage during
 regressions.</p>

 <p>A new tool @('build/slowevents.pl') attempts to identify the
 slowest events in a book or a set of books.</p>")

(defxdoc note-7-2-vl
  :parents (note-7-2-books)
  :short "Notes about changes to @(see vl) and @(see sv) in ACL2 7.2."

  :long "<p>Below we describe changes since the ACL2 7.1 release to the
unstable, development version of @(see VL).  Note that the stable version,
@(see vl2014), is essentially unchanged except for minor bugfixes.  See also
@(see note-7-1-vl) for some background about VL and VL2014.</p>


<h3>Extended SystemVerilog Support</h3>

<p>Much of the development work has focused on supporting additional features
of SystemVerilog.</p>

<p><b>Interfaces.</b> VL and SV now have much better support for interfaces.
They can now contain functions, tasks, assignments, etc.  Modports are now
generally understood: they participate in scopes, are sanity checked for name
clashes, are supported in submodule instantiation, etc.  Interface usage in
submodule instances are properly type checked and are generally supported in VL
and through SV.  Note that interface arrays are not yet supported.</p>

<p><b>Assertions.</b> VL's parser and pretty-printer now support many
SystemVerilog assertion features, including at least sequence/property
expressions (see @(see vl::property-expressions)), procedural assertions (see
@(see vl::vl-assertstmt) and @(see vl::vl-cassertstmt)), sequence and property
declarations (see @(see vl::vl-sequence) and @(see vl::vl-property)), and
module-level assertions (see @(see vl::vl-assertion) and @(see
vl::vl-cassertion)).  Note that all of this assertion-related stuff is
currently ignored by the SV flow.  However, modules with assertions should at
least no longer result in parse errors, and these structures may some day be a
useful basis for implementing assertion checking tools.</p>

<p><b>Aliases.</b> Alias constructs should now work in VL and are also
supported by SV.</p>

<p><b>Expressions.</b> The @('**') (exponent/power) operator, @('inside')
operator are now supported in both @(see vl) and SV.  Note that NCV/VCS
disagree about the sizing of @('inside') operators and that in general these
operators may be buggy on commercial tools.  Added support for a few additional
system functions like @('$dimensions'), etc.</p>

<p><b>Statements.</b> The parsing and representation of @(see vl::statements)
has been extended in various ways.  Note that our support for statements in SV
is still rather limited, so just because we can parse these things doesn't
necessarily mean they will be handled all the way through the SV flow:</p>

<ul>

<li>@('break') and @('continue') statements are now implemented.</li>

<li>Statement labels are now supported.</li>

<li>There is better support for subroutine call statements; so we can now parse
things like @('void'(...)') and otherwise do slightly better with calls of
tasks/functions in statements.</li>

<li>We now permit function calls/task enables with explicit parens but no
arguments.  (In Verilog-2005, was is syntactically legal to write statements
like @('mytask;') but not @('mytask();') with the explicit parens, even though
they seem like they should be equivalent.  In SystemVerilog both forms are
allowed, but we had previously only supported the @('mytask;') version.)</li>

<li>Block statements (@('begin/end'), @('fork/join'), ...) can now have
typedefs.  We can now parse @('fork/join_any') and @('fork/join_none')
statements.</li>

<li>@('final') statements are now allowed.  Much like @('initial') statements,
these are simply ignored in the SV flow.</li>

</ul>


<p><b>DPI import/exports.</b> DPI import/exports, used to connect SystemVerilog
to C programs, are now tolerated by VL's parser and are now to some degree
understood by other parts of VL.  For instance, they are known to @(see
vl::scopestack)s and can be considered when checking for name clashes,
introducing implicit wires, etc.  See @(see vl::vl-dpiimport) and @(see
vl::vl-dpiexport).</p>


<p><b>Instances.</b> Module and gate instance arrays can now use the
single-expression ranges, i.e., we now support things like:</p>

@({
      and foo [3] (o, a, b);
      submod foo [3] (a, b, c);
})

<p>Note that SystemVerilog also allows multiple-dimension instance arrays, but
those are still unsupported.</p>


<p><b>Other.</b> Many bugfixes (e.g., to the parser, scoping, etc) have
resulted in VL being able to successfully load additional designs.</p>


<h3>Scoping and @(see vl::annotate) improvements.</h3>

<p>The SV and Linter flows now use a unified @(see vl::annotate) meta-transform
to prepare the design for analysis.  This transform has been significantly
improved to do a better job with scoping issues related to functions, tasks,
generate constructs, and statements.  This provides broad improvements to what
VL can successfully parse and translate.</p>

<p>The @(see vl::make-implicit-wires) transformation, which plays a
surprisingly important role in getting scoping right, now more closely matches
commercial tools like NCV and VCS.  We are particularly more careful about how
implicit wires are inferred from expressions involving indexing/selection like
@('foo[w]').  In general, in a structure pattern like @(''{foo : 3}'), it's
tricky to tell whether @('foo') is a structure member or a parameter.  VL now
handles this much better and our strategy is documented; see @(see
vl::vl-patternkey-ambiguity).  It also used to be that such patterns could fool
VL into inferring implicit wires for @('foo')!  This has been fixed.</p>

<p>Much of @('make-implicit-wires') has been moved into the related @(see
vl::shadowcheck) transform.  The representation of functions and tasks has been
adjusted to better support correct scoping and shadowchecking, and shadowcheck
now understands user-defined types.  Shadowcheck was also incorrectly handling
certain situations with package imports, which has been fixed.  It also now
checks for name clashes in all scopes and produces good warnings in this case.
Finally, shadowcheck treats the global scope in a less incorrect way, fixing
many problems with global package imports.</p>

<p>VL's scoping of generates also used to be completely wrong.  While it still
has some known bugs, it has been significantly improved.  The scoping of
@('genvars') is also improved.  Bugs have also been fixed related to
disambiguating types from expressions in functions and tasks, and also in the
handling of types versus interfaces in ports.</p>


<h3>Generates, Elaboration</h3>

<p>One of the trickiest parts of VL is elaboration, where parameters are
expanded into constants, generate blocks are resolved, etc.  To evaluate a
parameter like</p>

@({
     parameter foo = $bits(mypkg::mytype_t) + blah2size(settings.blah);
})

<p>we need to evaluate its expression.  This can involve looking up the values
of other parameters from other places in the hierarchy, evaluating system and
user-defined functions, etc.  Functions are defined in terms of statements, so
we need to understand statements as well.  This all gets to be a very messy
mutual recursion.</p>

<p>VL's implementation of elaboration now reuses much of the SV code for
converting Verilog expressions into @(see sv::svex)es, and is now able to
resolve many significantly more complex parameters and generates.</p>


<h3>Linter</h3>

<p>The @(see vl::vl-lint) tool now uses much more of the SV code.  It shares the
@(see vl::annotate) code with the SV flow and also uses SV-based elaboration,
which provides much better handling of generates and allows it to
unparameterize modules involving types and other complex expressions.  The very
useful size warnings from VL2014 have also been ported to work with the new SV
code base.</p>

<p>Various warning heuristics and messages have been tweaked.  We no longer
complain about duplicate interface instances, since that's perfectly
reasonable.  Parse errors have some additional context.  Lucid has been
extended to understand new features like interfaces and modports, DPI
imports/exports, and final blocks.</p>


<h3>Test Suites</h3>

<p>Significant work has gone into testing VL.  VL now has three test
suites:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>centaur/vl/linttest</b> &mdash; tests of Linter functionality.  This
notably includes a lot of tests of scoping and sizing issues.</li>

<li><b>centaur/sv/cosims</b> &mdash; tests comparing VL+SV behavior against
that of commercial simulators such as NCV and VCS.  These are our main tests of
SV.  You can also search for @('no_ncv') or @('no_vcs') to discover places
where VL disagrees with one tool or another (e.g., because the commercial tools
don't agree.)</li>

<li><b>centaur/sv/failtest</b> &mdash; tests that ensure VL+SV report fatal
errors for modules that have some bad problem.  This turns out to be a nice way
to test many scoping issues and make sure that we will reject bad
constructs.</li>

</ul>

<p>Running @('make vl') in the @('acl2/books') directory now automatically also
runs all of the linttests and failtests.  It doesn't automatically run the
cosims, since that requires commercial simulators.)</p>

<p>Each of the test suites has been extended considerably, especially in the
tricky areas of scoping, implicit wire creation, generate handling, and also in
order to test new features like interface support.  Many of the old VL2014
@('systest') tests have also been ported to the new @('cosims') format.</p>



<h3>Other Notes</h3>

<p>VL and SV are still evolving rapidly and a lot is in flux.</p>

<p>There has been significant renaming of files, moving of files, and deleting
of dead files.  The documentation has gotten a lot of work in some areas, but
of course there is more to do.</p>

<p>Numerous minor bugfixes in all areas of VL are not mentioned, but can be
found in the change log.</p>")

 <h3>Deleted Books and Stubs</h3>

 <p>When we move a book, we often add a <b>stub</b> book in its previous
 location to help you transition your @(see include-book) commands.  The @(see
 build::cert.pl) build system prints warnings when a stub book is being
 included.  Stub books have a lifespan of one release.  The following books
 were stubs in ACL2 7.0, so we've deleted them.</p>

 @({
     Previous Location                          Replacement

 })

 <p>The directory @('fix-cert/') has been deleted, as it is no longer necessary
 now that it is possible to move the system books directory after certifying
 its books (see @(see note-7-1)).</p>

 <p>The directory @('regex/') has been moved to @('projects/regex/').</p>


 <h3>New Libraries and Documentation</h3>

 <p>David Russinoff has contributed a new version of the rtl library:
 @('rtl/rel10/').  This time the new version depends on a previous version,
 namely, @('rtl/rel9/').  The new @('rtl/rel10/') library has, in turn, been
 adapted to reside in a new @('\"RTL\"') package; the result is
 @('rtl/rel11/').</p>

 <p>Marijn Heule's @('drat-trim') tool, for checking SAT solver proofs, is now
 available in @('tools/drat-trim').</p>

 <p>Matt Kaufmann and Cuong Chau have formalized the overspill property in
 ACL2(r), see @('nonstd/nsa/overspill.lisp').</p>

 <p>The new @('clause-processors/induction') book demonstrates a (not very
 practical) clause processor that does induction.</p>

 <p>The new directory @('projects/fifo') has a list-based FIFO implementation,
 that has some properties proven about it.</p>

 <p>The new book @('books/tools/include-an-arithmetic-book.lisp')
 provides short-hand includes of the arithmetic libraries, including
 various configurations of @('arithmetic-5').</p>

 <p>The @('misc/assert') book is now documented; see for instance @(see
 assert!).</p>

 <p>The documentation for @(see data-structures) is now included in the manual;
 previously it was excluded because of name conflicts with other libraries, but
 these have now been resolved.</p>

 <h3>Name Changes</h3>

 <p>As mentioned above, the newest @(see rtl) library is now in an @('RTL')
 package.</p>

 <p>The @(see bitops) library is now in a new @('BITOPS') package.  See below
 (under ``bitops'') for more information and suggestions about porting books.</p>

 <p>Renamed @('remove-keywords') to @('remove-any-keywords') in
 @('coi/nary/nary.lisp') to avoid a name conflict between the @('coi') and
 @('ccg') books; also updated the @('nary') workshop books.</p>


 <h3>@(see std)</h3>

 <p>The @(see b*) book has moved from @('tools/bstar') to @('std/util/bstar').
 There is a stub in the previous location.  As a special compatibility measure,
 this stub will be kept available for two releases.</p>

 <p>Added new @(see print-legibly) and @(see print-compressed) functions to
 @(see std/io).  These can print to @(':object') channels with or without @(see
 serialize)-style compression, and have the necessary theorems about state and
 output-channel preservation.</p>

 <p>There is new syntactic sugar based on @(see define)'s named return values.
 The new @(see defret) macro offers a more comfortable syntax for proving
 theorems about return values by their name.  Also, the new <see topic='@(url
 patbind-ret)'>ret</see> binder for @(see b*) allows you to name the bundled
 return values from a @(see define) and then access individual components using
 a C-like or @(see std::defaggregate)/@(see fty::defprod)-like @('.') syntax.</p>

 <p>The @(see define) macro now checks the arity of @(':returns') specifiers
 when possible.</p>

 <p>Some @('std/lists') books have been tweaked:</p>

 <ul>

 <li>The @(see acl2-count) book now provides stronger rules.</li>

 <li>The @('equal-sets') book now includes the lemma
 @('set-equiv-of-nil').</li>

 <li>The @('append') book now includes a few rules about (ca/dr (append ...))
 to std/lists.  (Two of the new rules are disabled, and there's a theory
 invariant to make sure things stay reasonable.)</li>

 <li>The @('duplicity') book now have stronger theorems relating @(see
 duplicity) to @(see member-equal).</li>

 </ul>


 <h3>@(see oslib)</h3>

 <p>Added a new @(see oslib::universal-time) function.</p>

 <p>Fixed a raw lisp bug with the definition of @9see oslib::ls), and added a
 regression test.</p>

 <p>Fixed minor bugs with @(see oslib::copy).</p>


 <h3>@(see bitops)</h3>

 <p>Bitops is now in a package.  To minimize backwards incompatibility, the new
 package imports a lot of stuff that you might not expect.  For instance all of
 the @(see logops-definitions), and their recursive @('**') variants are still
 found in the ACL2 package, as are most of the bitops rulesets, its new
 function definitions, and many frequently instantiated theorems.  When
 updating your books, you may find it convenient to import
 @('*bitops-exports*') into packages that use bitops functions.</p>

 <p>Extended the @(see bitops::bitops/merge) book with several new 256- and
 512-bit merges, @(see bitops::merge-8-u2s), and improved its
 documentation.</p>

 <p>Added @(see nth-slice128).</p>


 <h3>@(see fty::fty)</h3>

 <p>The case macros from @(see fty::defflexsum) and @(see fty::deftranssum) now
 require a variable, and cannot bind that variable itself, because the syntax
 for doing so was too weird and unintuitive.  They can now also be used to
 carry out type-checks, e.g., @('(foo-case x :mytag)') now returns true when
 @('x') has tag @(':mytag').</p>

 <p>The macros @('defoption') and @('deftranssum') macros, formerly part of
 @(see vl), are now integrated into the @(see fty::deftypes) framework.</p>


 <h3>@(see xdoc)</h3>

 <p>The fancy viewer's jump-to box should perform better.  It now suggest exact
 name matches first and otherwise shows results in importance order, instead of
 alphabetical order, which may be better when there are many matches.</p>

 <p>The fancy viewer now features a mobile-friendly version with many features.
 This should greatly improve access to ACL2 documentation at parties, sporting
 events, and other social occasions.</p>

 <p>Fixed a bug with @('<em>') tag handling that affected the @(':xdoc')
 command and Emacs-based @(see acl2-doc) tool.</p>

 <p>Fixed a bug with using multiple @(see defsection) extensions with the same
 name.  Defsection now requires a non-nil symbol as the section name.</p>

 <p>As the manual has grown substantially, some memory management measures have
 been taken in @('doc/top.lisp').</p>


 <h3>@(see quicklisp)</h3>

 <p>The approach to distributing Common Lisp libraries has been updated to use
 the new <a href='http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/bundles.html'>Quicklisp
 bundles</a> feature.  Some additional Common Lisp libraries have been
 added to the bundle.</p>

 <p>The @(see tshell) library is now based on the <a
 href='https://github.com/jaredcdavis/shellpool'>Shellpool</a> Common Lisp
 library (via @(see quicklisp)).  This may improve reliability and cross-lisp
 portability for @('tshell') itself and also for libraries like @(see satlink)
 which are based on it.</p>


 <h3>@(see vl), @(see esim), and now @(see vl2014)</h3>

 <p>VL and ESIM have undergone major changes, including a fork of VL.  For
 details about these changes, see @(see note-7-1-vl).</p>


 <h3>Other Libraries</h3>

 <p>Ben Selfridge's @(see leftist-trees) library is now available under an
 MIT/X11 style license instead of the GNU General Public License.</p>

 <p>The bounding theorems for @(see logext) in @('ihs/logops-definitions') have
 been tightened.</p>

 <p>For the @(see tau-system), there is now a @(see UNARY--) bounder in
 @('tau/bounders/elementary-bounders').</p>

 <p>The @(see defsort) macro has been enhanced to better support the fixtype
 discipline of the @(see fty::fty) library.  In support of this, it now
 requires a stricter transitivity property, i.e., the comparison function must
 support unconditional transitivity, regardless of element type.  (This is
 typically easy to achieve by using @('<<') as a fallback in case of malformed
 elements.)</p>

 <p>The Codewalker demo books have been improved to use built-in function
 nat-listp and weaken the hyps (state invariant) so that the state components
 consist of integers, not naturals.</p>

 <p>@(see gl) now uses an improved theory for better @(see
 def-gl-clause-processor) event performance.</p>

 <p>The @(see template-subst) tool now has some extended repetition
 capabilities.</p>

 <p>Various other libraries have received minor cleanups.</p>


 <h3>Build System Updates</h3>

 <p>@(see build::cert.pl), et al. now tolerate @('( include-book...') instead
 of @('(include-book...'), etc.</p>

 <p>Errors during portcullis events (i.e., @('.acl2') files) should now cause
 certification to fail; many books have been updated to avoid problems that
 were, until now, just being ignored.</p>

 <p>Various updates have been made to the Jenkins scripts to keep things up to
 date.</p>

 <p>For most Lisps, @(see build::cert.pl) will now include garbage collection
 messages in output logs files.  This may occasionally be useful when debugging
 performance issues.</p>

  :short "Notes about changes to @(see vl) and @(see esim) in ACL2 Version
7.1."

  :long "<h3>VL Fork</h3>

 <p>There have been many changes to @(see vl) and @(see esim).  Most notably,
 VL has been forked into two versions.</p>

 <dl>
 <dt>@(see vl2014) is a ``stable'' fork of VL.</dt>
 <dd>It lives in a new directory: @('books/centaur/vl2014')</dd>
 <dd>It uses the @('VL2014') package.</dd>
 <dd>It continues to work with @(see esim) and other, older tools.</dd>
 <dd>It is no longer under active development by Centaur.</dd>

 <dt>@(see vl) continues as the ``development'' version of VL.</dt>
 <dd>It continues to live in: @('books/centaur/vl').</dd>
 <dd>It continues to use the @('VL') package.</dd>
 <dd>It <b>no longer supports @(see esim)</b>.</dd>
 <dd>It remains under active development.</dd>
 <dd>It targets a new backend (instead of esim) which is still under development.</dd>
 <dd>It may be rather unstable and not yet particularly usable.</dd>
 </dl>

 <p>The new @('vl') code base is in many cases significantly different than
 @(see vl2014).  It features a new, more strongly typed expression
 representation, generally better abstractions for working with
 scopes/hierarchy and types, and new approaches to elaboration and sizing that
 can handle much more of SystemVerilog.  More information on the motives and
 consequences of this split can be found in the documentation for @(see
 vl2014).</p>

 <p>Largely in support of this fork, many books have been reorganized.  Many
 books that are specific to the VL/ESIM flow have been moved into the ESIM
 directory:</p>

 @({
    centaur/vl/top.lisp --> centaur/vl/defmodules.lisp (with a stub)
    centaur/vl/defmodules.lisp --> centaur/esim/defmodules.lisp
    centaur/vl/translation.lisp --> centaur/esim/translation.lisp
    centaur/vl/toe --> centaur/esim/vltoe (filenames have been unsmurfed)
    centaur/vl/util/esim-lemmas.lisp --> centaur/esim/vltoe
    centaur/vl/transforms/occform/* --> centaur/esim/occform
 })

 <p>Various other files have also been moved into ESIM:</p>

 @({
    centaur/tutorial --> centaur/esim/tutorial
    centaur/vcd --> centaur/esim/vcd
    centaur/regression --> centaur/esim/tests
 })

 <p>Many other minor file-name changes have been made to help improve the
 organization of the code base.</p>

 <p>The various VL <i>flows</i> are also now better separated.  For
 instance:</p>

 <ul>

 <li>The ESIM flow no longer performs certain linter checks that are better
 handled by VL-Lint.  For instance, it no longer generates a classic
 use-set-report since the new Lucid reporting is much better.</li>

 <li>The @('vl model') command (based on the ESIM flow) is no longer used in
 the module browser.  Instead, the module browser now reads @('.vlzip') files
 that are produced by the @('vl zip') command, which is independent of
 ESIM.</li>

 </ul>


 <h3>Extended Support for Verilog/SystemVeriog</h3>

 <p>The new VL (and in some cases VL2014) now have better support for at least
 the following Verilog/SystemVerilog features:</p>

 <ul>
 <li>@('.*') connections that involve interface ports,</li>
 <li>@('return') statements in functions,</li>
 <li>@('inside') expressions like @('a inside {b, c, [d:e]}'),</li>
 <li>@('generate') constructs,</li>
 <li>System functions like @('$bits') and @('$clog2'),</li>
 <li>Unpacked dimensions in various contexts,</li>
 <li>Matched @('end : foo') style endings on blocks,</li>
 <li>Declarations on unnamed blocks,</li>
 <li>Typedefs with a single unpacked dimension, i.e., @('typedef ... foo_t [3]'),</li >
 <li>Ports whose expressions involve parameters,</li>
 <li>Scope expressions and other complex hierarchical expressions,</li>
 <li>Module level begin/end blocks (not in the spec but supported by simulators),</li >
 <li>Package imports in block statements, functions, and tasks,</li>
 <li>Certain complex assignment patterns,</li>
 <li>The @('`\"'), @('`\\`\\\"'), and @('``') escapes in @('`define') macros,</li>
 <li>Certain macro invocations in @('`include')/@('`ifdef') forms,</li>
 </ul>


 <h3>@(see vl::vl-lint) Improvements</h3>

 <p>The loader works harder to attach parse-time warnings to the appropriate
 modules.</p>

 <p>The new @(see vl::lucid) check is a far more capable check for unused,
 unset, and multiply driven wires, with proper understanding of SystemVerilog
 scoping.  The old use-set and multidrive warnings have been retired.</p>

 <p>Heuristic improvements have been made to leftright checking,
 extension/fussy size warnings for @(''1')/@(''0')/..., and duplicate instance
 checking involving interfaces and portless modules.  Extension warning
 heuristics are also now attachable.</p>

 <p>Improved the warning messages for zero-sized replications, overflowing
 integer literals, and generally for warnings where expressions involve
 parameters after unparameterization.</p>

 <p>Portcheck now warns about stylistically undesirable ports such as
 @('foo[3:0]').</p>

 <p>There is now a basic suite of system-level tests directed at the linter;
 see the @('linttest') directory.  These tests have shed light on many minor
 linter bugs.</p>")

  :short "Release notes for the ACL2 Community Books for ACL2 7.0 (January
 2015)"
  :long "<p>The following is a brief summary of changes made to the @(see
 community-books) between the releases of ACL2 6.5 and 7.0.</p>

 <p>The <a
 href='https://github.com/acl2/acl2/wiki/Release-version-numbers'>acl2-books
 Wiki page on Release Version Numbers</a> gives the Git/SVN revision numbers
 corresponding to releases.  See also @(see note-7-0) for the changes made to
 ACL2 itself.  For additional details, you may also see the raw <a
 href='https://github.com/acl2/acl2/commits/master'>commit log</a>.</p>

 <h2>Organizational, Build System, and Name Changes</h2>


 <h3>Source Code Moved</h3>

 <p>The ACL2 Community Books and ACL2 System source code repositories have been
 merged into one repository and are now available at</p>

 <box><p><a
 href=\"https://github.com/acl2/acl2\">https://github.com/acl2/acl2</a></p></box>

 <p>See the @('Readme.md') file found there for more details.  See also the
 @(see git-quick-start) guide if you are interested in contributing.</p>



 <h3>Deleted Stubs</h3>

 <p>When we move a book, we often add a <b>stub</b> book in its previous
 location to help you transition your @(see include-book) commands.  The @(see
 build::cert.pl) build system prints warnings when a stub book is being
 included.</p>

 <p>Stub books have a lifespan of one release.  The following books were stubs
 in ACL2 6.5, so we've deleted them.</p>

 @({
      Previous Location                New Location

    ---------------------------------------------------------------
 })


 <h3>Build System Changes</h3>

 <p>The @('arithmetic-2') library is no longer built by default when running an
 ordinary @('make').  All books that previously depended on @('arithmetic-2')
 have been transitioned to use @('arithmetic-3') instead.  If your own work
 depends on @('arithmetic-2'), you can still build these books, e.g., by running
 @('make arithmetic-2') in the @('books') directory.</p>

 <p>Many minor tweaks and cleanups have been made to the build system
 itself.</p>

 <ul>

 <li>@('cert.pl') now has better support for @(see
 provisional-certification).</li>

 <li>The @(see build::cert_param) mechanism, which is used by @(see
 build::cert.pl) to indicate that books have special requirements, is now
 documented.</li>

 <li>New @('cert_param') directives have been added to avoid certifying certain
 books on incompatible Lisps.</li>

 <li>@(see build::cert.pl) now better avoids overflowing the maximum number of
 arguments to shell commands on some platforms when certifying large numbers of
 books.</li>

 <li>The new @(':ignore-certs') feature of @(see include-book) is now used in
 special two-pass books like @('std/strings/defs-program.lisp'), and should help
 to make building these books more reliable.</li>

 <li>Hundreds of old Makefiles from the @(see books-certification-classic) era
 have been eliminated.  Some obsolete GCL-specific directives have also been
 eliminated.</li>

 <li>Installing @(see quicklisp) now works from behind a proxy.  See <i>Using a
 Proxy</i> in @(see books-certification) for details.</li>

 <li>The implementation of ``@('make everything')'' has been cleaned up.  In
 particular, it no longer sets @('USE_QUICKLISP=1') since this is not
 appropriate for some Lisps.</li>

 <li>The @('make clean') command now does a better job of cleaning up generated
 files.</li>

 </ul>

 <p>Numerous books have been patched up for better portability across Lisps and
 integration with ACL2(p).  For instance: In many cases, previous calls of @(see
 without-waterfall-parallelism) are no longer necessary, largely due to
 thread-safe memoization; several @(see oslib) functions have been extended to
 work on additional Lisps; many books with raw Lisp code now use @(see
 include-raw) for more portable compilation behavior across Lisps.</p>

 <p>Various other utilities have been made more reliable.</p>

 <ul>

 <li>For Emacs @('TAGS') users, the @('etags.sh') script has been improved to
 permit whitespace before definitions.</li>

 <li>For ACL2 packaging mechanisms, the @('fix-cert') utility has been improved
 and now includes scripts for moving ACL2 distributions.</li>

 </ul>

 <p>Supporting scripts for the <a href='http://jenkins-ci.org/'>Jenkins</a>
 continuous integration server can now be found in the @('build/jenkins')
 directory.  These scripts have received significant attention and can now
 support multi-configuration builds for checking ACL2 books compatibility with
 many host Lisps.</p>


 <h3>Name Conflict Resolution</h3>

 <p>Progress has been made toward resolving name clashes in order to be able to
 include more books together.  This work involves renaming certain lemmas and
 may require updates to your books.</p>

 <p>Arithmetic-2</p>

 <ul>
 <li>@('floor-mod-elim') no longer forces its hypothesis.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>Arithmetic-5</p>
 <ul>
 <li>@('floor-=-x/y') now has additional corollaries.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>IHS</p>
 <ul>
 <li>@('floor-mod-elim') no longer forces its hypothesis.</li>
 <li>@('floor-=-x/y') now has additional corollaries.</li>
 <li>@('justify-floor-recursion') has been renamed to @('floor-recursion').</li>
 <li>@('cancel-floor-+') has been renamed to @('cancel-floor-+-basic').</li>
 <li>@('cancel-mod-+') has been renamed to @('cancel-mod-+-basic').</li>
 <li>@('rationalp-mod') no longer requires @('(rationalp x)').</li>
 </ul>

 <p>COI/osets</p>

 <ul>

 <li>Many @('coi/osets') books are now just small wrappers around @('std/osets')
 books.</li>

 <li>COI's @('double-containment') rule has been renamed to
 @('double-containment-expensive').</li>

 </ul>


 <h3>Licensing Changes</h3>

 <p>Robert Krug's @('arithmetic-3') library of is now available under a
 BSD-3-Clause style license instead of the GNU General Public License.</p>

 <p>Several books contributed by David Rager, which were formerly released under
 the GNU General Public License or a BSD-3-Clause style license, are now instead
 released under a (more permissive) MIT/X11-style license.</p>

 <p>Several books contributed by Oracle, which were formerly released under the
 GNU General Public License, are now instead released under an MIT/X11-style
 license.</p>

 <p>The @(see ubdds) library and a few \"miscellaneous\" books have also been
 transitioned from the GNU General Public License to a 3-clause BSD style
 license.</p>

 <p>Several books in the @('coi') library, which previously lacked explicit
 license information, now have explicit MIT/X11-style licenses.</p>


 <h2>New Libraries and Documentation</h2>

 <p>The ACL2+Books manual has a great deal of new and improved content and many
 topics have been reorganized to provide a more coherent hierarchy.  Notably,
 all documentation in the legacy <i>defdoc</i> format has been rewritten into
 the @(see xdoc) format.  Some highlights:</p>

 <ul>
 <li>The @(see ihs) documentation has been considerably updated.</li>
 <li>The @(see defsort) macro is now documented.</li>
 <li>The @(see sneaky) documentation has been considerably expanded.</li>
 <li>Topics like @(see lists), @(see strings), @(see alists), etc., now
 group together some related @(see programming) functions.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>The ACL2 @(see Sidekick) is an experimental and very preliminary graphical
 add-on to ACL2.  It currently features a session viewer, theory linter, a
 horribly primitive interface to the @(see proof-builder), and a slick
 <i>Lookup</i> feature that can show you documentation and other information
 about various symbols.</p>

 <p>The new @('system/toothbrush') directory provides a way to create
 applications with ACL2 that have a much smaller memory footprint than an
 ordinary ACL2 @(see save-exec) image.  See the @('README') file in this
 directory for more information.</p>

 <p>The new @(see depgraph::depgraph) library now contains a few algorithms for
 working with dependency graphs.  It provides @(see depgraph::toposort), a
 topological sort, @(see depgraph::invert), an edge-inversion algorithm, and
 @(see depgraph::transdeps), which can compute the transitive dependencies for a
 set of nodes.  This functionality was formerly part of @(see VL) but has now
 been made more general and extracted.</p>

 <p>The new @('projects/codewalker/') directory contains Codewalker, a utility
 for exploring code in any programming language specified by an ACL2 model to
 discover certain properties of the code.  Demos of Codewalker are also in that
 directory.</p>

 <p>The new directory @('projects/hybrid-systems/') is a
 specification/verification project by Shant Harutuntian using ACL2(r) (see
 @(see real)), in support of his 2007 Ph.D. dissertation, with a few recent
 updates (because of ACL2 changes) made by Cuong Chau.</p>

 <p>There are also several new small tools and books.</p>

 <ul>

 <li>(CCL Only) The new @(see spacewalk) tool can be used to get a report about
 heap memory usage.  It may be useful for identifying unusually large functions
 and constants in your ACL2 session.</li>

 <li>The new @(see simp) tool can be used to ask ACL2 to simplify terms under
 certain hypotheses.</li>

 <li>The new tool @('misc/check-fn-inst') can be used to check the constraints
 to a functional instantiation.</li>

 <li>The new tool, @(see def-saved-obligs), can be used to save proof
 obligations for an event as independent defthms.</li>

 <li>The new tool, @('system/dead-source-code.lisp'), may be useful
 for finding dead code in the ACL2 sources.</li>

 <li>The new books @('system/cantor-pairing-bijective.lisp') and
 @('system/hl-nat-combine-onto.lisp') contain proofs of bijectivity and
 surjectivity (one-one/onto and onto, respectively) of cantor-pairing
 functions.</li>

 </ul>

 <h2>Changes to Major Libraries</h2>

 <h3>XDOC Changes</h3>

 <p>The web-based XDOC viewer has been improved.  It now uses newer versions of
 the JQuery and Typeahead libraries.  Some bugs with the typeahead (jump to) box
 have been fixed and it has been extended to show more results.  The jump-to box
 has been extended with a @('Alt+/') hotkey (or perhaps some other key
 combination like @('Ctrl+/'), depending on your browser).  Middle clicking on
 XDOC links should now properly open them in new tabs and the fonts have been
 updated.  Some ugly quotes are now replaced by ``smart'' replacements.</p>

 <p>Significant work has been done to try to make XDOC content accessible to
 search engines such as Google.  A new PHP script largely replaces previous
 failed efforts to generate \"static\" HTML files, site maps, and so forth.</p>

 <p>XDOC now supports \"resource directories\" for incorporating images, PDF
 files, and other kinds of resources.  See @(see xdoc::add-resource-directory)
 for details.</p>

 <p>XDOC now features @(see xdoc::katex-integration) for writing LaTeX-like
 formulas like @($ \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{n} \\sqrt{f(i)} \\right) <
 \\frac{n^2}{k} $) within your documentation.  Note that ACL2's new @(see
 fancy-string-reader) can be used to make escaping simpler, and this may be
 especially useful when trying to write LaTeX-like formulas, where the escaping
 of @('\\') characters can be irritating.</p>

 <p>There are also many other minor changes:</p>

 <ul>

 <li>The @(see defpointer) macro has been integrated into XDOC itself.  (It was
 formerly only part of the ACL2 system documentation.)</li>

 <li>@(see defsection) and @(see define) now permit plain strings to be included
 among the list of events.  These strings are incorporated into the resulting
 documentation as running commentary.</li>

 <li>The @(see defxdoc), @(see defsection), and @(see define) macros now all
 evaluate the arguments to @(':short') and @(':long') instead of quoting them.
 This may make it more convenient to write macros that produce documentation
 from boilerplate templates, e.g., you can now directly write things like
 @(':short (cat ...)').</li>

 <li>Tweaked @(see defsection) so that you can give @(':extension (foo)')
 instead of just @(':extension foo.')</li>

 <li>Better error handling on @(see xdoc::xdoc-extend) and @(see
 xdoc::xdoc-prepend).</li>

 </ul>



 <h3>@(see STD) Library Changes</h3>


 <h5>@(see std/basic)</h5>

 <p>Added @(see tuplep) and @(see impossible).</p>


 <h5>@(see std/lists)</h5>

 <p>Cleaned up rules about take in @(see std/lists/take).</p>

 <p>@(see replicate) is now an alias for @(see repeat) and is compatible with
 the definition of @('repeat') in the COI libraries, fixing a longstanding
 incompatibility.</p>

 <p>The @(see all-equalp) function has been added.</p>

 <p>Several lemmas about @(see intersection$), @(see intersectp), and @(see
 set-difference$) have been extracted from @(see vl) and moved into
 @('std/lists').  See for instance @(see std/lists/intersection$),
 @(see std/lists/intersectp), and @(see std/lists/set-difference).</p>




 <h5>@(see std/util)</h5>

 <p>The @(see b*) binders for @(see std::defaggregate)s now also bind the
 variable, fixing a longstanding issue.  Also, the syntax @('((prodname name))')
 is now permitted as an abbreviation for @('((prodname name) name)').  (This is
 often useful when destructuring a function's arguments).</p>

 <p>The @(see b*) binders for @(see std::defaggregate) (and also @(see
 fty::defprod)) are now extensible and can translate bindings like @('x.foo')
 into calls of user-defined functions.  See the description of <i>Extra Binder
 Names</i> in the documentation of @(see std::defaggregate) for details.</p>

 <p>The @(see std::deflist), @(see std::defalist), @(see std::defprojection),
 and @(see std::defmapappend) macros are now \"pluggable\" and can be extended
 with additional theorems; see for instance the new book
 @('std/lists/abstract.lisp').</p>

 <p>The new books @('std/util/deflist-base') and @('std/util/defalist-base')
 offer lighter-weight alternative to @('std/util/deflist') and
 @('std/util/defalist').</p>

 <p>The @(see std::defrule) book now has fewer dependencies.</p>

 <p>Documentation for @(see std::deflist) has been improved.  @('Deflist') now
 uses @(see define) so that you get a signature block in the resulting
 documentation.  The documentation for automatically generated deflist events is
 now put in a more sensible order and split off into a @('foolistp-basics')
 section underneath of @('foolistp'), to reduce the prominence of this
 \"boilerplate\" documentation.  Deflist can now also create documentation even
 in the @('already-definedp') case.</p>

 <p>Fixed an obscure bug with @(see define)'s return-specifiers that could
 affect non-executable functions that involve stobjs.</p>

 <p>The @(see define) macro now interprets @(':inline nil') as \"make this a
 <see topic='@(url defun-notinline)'>$notinline</see> function\" instead of
 \"make this a regular function instead of an <see topic='@(url
 defun-inline)'>inline</see> one.\"</p>

 <p>The @(see define), @(see defines), and also the @(see fty::deffixequiv)
 macros now have improved, more advanced default hints set for inductive proofs
 in return specs and @('deffixequiv(-mutual)') forms.</p>


 <h5>@(see std/strings)</h5>

 <p>Certification time has been improved.</p>

 <p>The @('fast-cat') book (see @(see str::cat)) now uses @(see include-raw) to
 avoid possible issues on various Lisps.</p>

 <h5>@(see std/io)</h5>

 <p>Added @(see read-file-as-string) function.</p>

 <h5>@(see std/alists)</h5>

 <p>There are some new functions: @(see fal-find-any) and @(see
 fal-all-boundp).</p>

 <p>Moved @(see worth-hashing) into @('std/alists') from
 @('misc/hons-help').</p>

 <h5>@(see std/typed-lists)</h5>

 <p>Move @(see cons-listp) and @(see cons-list-listp) out of VL and into
 @('std/typed-lists').</p>



 <h3>Defdata (Data Definition Framework)</h3>

 <p> @('Defdata') has undergone significant improvements.  Automated theorem
 proving support has been increased by a tight integration with @(csee
 Tau-system).  A significant new capability is the support for parametric
 polymorphism via @('sig') rules. There have been many improvements in its
 engineering too.</p>

 <h5>Tau Integration</h5>
 <p>
 Defdata analyzes the predicate definition of every new type and, if
 possible, produces a set of Tau rules that completely characterize
 the type. Defdata thus provides the following guarantee: If Tau is
 complete over the type reasoning theory, then adding a type to the
 current theory via @('defdata') preserves completeness.
 </p>

 <h5>Parametric Polymorphism</h5>
 <p>
 Defdata provides a new macro @('sig') which can be used to define
 signatures of polymorphic functions
 such as <tt>append</tt>, <tt>remove1</tt>, <tt>put-assoc</tt> etc:
 </p>
 @({
   (sig append ((listof :a) (listof :a)) => (listof :a))
   (sig remove1-equal (all (listof :a)) => (listof :a))
   (sig put-assoc-equal (:a :b (alistof :a :b)) => (alistof :a :b))
 })

 <p>
 Defdata automatically instantiates these generic theorems
 (type signatures) for previously defined types and as new types are defined
 after the @('sig') forms. Defdata, thus implements parametric polymorphism, by
 providing the following invariants:</p>

 <ul>
 <li> Every new defdata type is instantiated for every polymorphic
      signature (specified via sig) that matches (one of its argument
      types).</li>
 <li> Every new polymorphic signature is appropriately instantiated for
      all defdata types of the right shape in the current world. </li>
 </ul>

 <p> Dependent type hypotheses are supported by @('sig') -- e.g. the
 polymorphic signature of <tt>nth</tt> is specified as follows.  </p>

 @({
   (sig nth (nat (listof :a)) => :a
        :satisfies (< x1 (len x2)))
 })

 <h5>Other Theory Reasoning</h5>

 <p>Theory support for Records (structs) and Maps has been tuned to be more
 robust. Destructor Elimination is now available for records.</p>

 <h5>Advanced Usage</h5>
 <p>
 @('Defdata') has been re-engineered to have a plug-in like
 architecture. The following macros provide ways to extend the Defdata
 language and its semantics.</p>
 <dl>
 <dd> @('register-type') -- Register a name as a defdata type (with its associated metadata).</dd>
 <dd> @('register-data-constructor') -- Register a data constructor (for product types).</dd>
 <dd> @('register-user-combinator') -- Add user-defined syntactic sugar to the defdata language.
 e.g. <i>alistof</i> was added with minimal coding overhead using this facility (See defdata/alistof.lisp).</dd>
 <dd> @('defdata-attach') -- Replaces/subsumes) defdata-testing; it can be used to change or add defdata type metadata. </dd>
 </dl>


 <h3>Defsort</h3>

 <p>The interface to @(see defsort) has been extended, and it can now reuse
 existing list recognizers.</p>

 <p>Defsort can now (optionally) prove that the new sorting function is
 equivalent to an insertion sort.</p>

 <p>Defsort now allows extra arguments, e.g., to parameterize the sort.</p>



 <h3>Tools</h3>

 <p>The @(see include-raw) utility has been made more robust.  It now checks the
 write-date of compiled files, to avoid including stale files.</p>

 <p>The utilities @(see profile-acl2) and @(see profile-all) now work in the
 ACL2 loop, and are documented.</p>

 <p>The @('watch') utility works again.  Thanks to Bob Boyer for providing
 fixes.  To use this utility:</p>

 @({
    (include-book \"centaur/memoize/old/watch\" :dir :system :ttags :all)
    :q
    (watch)
    (lp)
    ; Now in Emacs, bring into a buffer the file reported by (watch), whose
    ; name is of the form watch-output-temp-n.lsp.  Then execute ACL2 forms.
 })

 <p>The @(see untranslate-patterns) tool is now compatible with @(see define)'s
 @(see untranslate-preprocess) hook.</p>


 <h3>OSLIB</h3>

 <p>OSLIB has been reorganized to try to make it somewhat more coherent.  Most
 files in oslib are now split up into, e.g., argv-logic.lisp (no raw code or
 ttags) and argv.lisp (actual implementation).</p>

 <p>OSLIB has new functions including @(see oslib::dirname), @(see
 oslib::basename), @(see oslib::copy), and @(see oslib::catpaths).</p>

 <p>The @(see oslib::ls), @(see oslib::ls-files), and @(see oslib::ls-subdirs)
 functions have been improved to return better error information, and made more
 portable across Lisps.</p>

 <h3>Tau</h3>

 <p>The book @('tau/bounders/elementary-bounders') has been improved by adding
 guards, thanks to Dmitry Nadezhin.</p>

 <h2>Changes to Centaur Libraries</h2>

 <h3>@(see bitops)</h3>

 <p>The new @(see bitops::bitops/part-install) macro can be used to set particular bits of an
 integer to a value.  It is somewhat similar to utilities like @(see wrb) from
 the IHS library, but its interface is perhaps more intuitive.</p>

 <p>The new @(see bitops::bitops/fast-rotate) macros provide optimized versions of @(see
 rotate-left) and @(see rotate-right).</p>

 <p>The new @(see bitops::bitops/logbitp-bounds) book provides a few lemmas relating
 @(see logbitp) to @(see expt).</p>


 <h3>@(see fty::fty)</h3>

 <p>The @(see std::deflist) and @(see fty::deflist) books are now integrated, so
 that @('fty::deflist') can provide the ordinary @('std::deflist') theorems.
 The @('fty::deflist') and @('fty::defalist') macros now provide at least @(see
 append) theorems by default.</p>

 <p>The documentation-generating macros have been enhanced.</p>

 <p>The @(see fty::deftypes) macro now uses more aggressive theory management to
 speed up certification, and also has more comprehensive error checking.</p>

 <p>The @(see fty::deffixtype) macro has better error checking.</p>

 <p>The cases macros introduced by @(see fty::deftypes) now support an
 @(':otherwise') case.</p>

 <p>The @(see fty::deftypes) @('make-') macros now disallow duplicated
 keywords.</p>

 <p>The @(see fty::deflist) and @(see fty::defalist) macros can now tolerate
 already-defined predicates.</p>

 <p>The @(see fty::basetypes) book has been filled out a bit, e.g., it now includes
 @(see maybe-natp).</p>

 <p>By default, @(see fty::deffixtype) now verifies the guards on the equivalence
 relations it introduces.</p>

 <h3>@(see Quicklisp)</h3>

 <p>Quicklisp can now read proxy information from the @('HTTP_PROXY_WITH_PORT')
 environment variable.  See also the \"Using a proxy\" page in @(see
 books-certification).  BOZO move that into Quicklisp?  Blah, all this stuff
 always ends up duplicated everywhere.</p>

 <p>Quicklisp now includes books for loading the @('uiop') library and a more
 sensible @('cl-fad') book.  These libraries may be useful for doing file system
 things.  The CCL-only restrictions on @('bordeaux-threads') and
 @('hunchentoot') have been dropped since these libraries seem to be working
 fine on modern SBCL distributions.  A book for the @('html-template') library
 has also been added.</p>

 <p>The Quicklisp build should be more robust.  It now checks for existing
 Quicklisp installations and produce a sensible error message instead of dying
 horribly.</p>


 <h3>Other</h3>

 <p>The @(see getopt) library now has a basic test suite.</p>

 <p>The @('centaur/misc/sharedlibs') code for relocating shared libraries has
 been extended with a test/demo script.  The sharedlibs functions no longer
 cause errors when used on non-CCL Lisps (they simply print a message,
 instead.)</p>

 <p>The @(see template-subst) tool has been expanded with some additional
 functions.</p>

 <p>The @(see profile-all) and @(see profile-acl2) functions can now be used
 from within the ACL2 loop instead of only from raw Lisp.</p>

 <p>The @(see flag::def-doublevar-induction) macro has been extended and improved.</p>

 <p>For @(see esim), there is a new tool for @(see stv) decomposition theorems,
 @('oracle/stv-decomp-theory-expander.lisp'), and a demo of using this tool in
 @('centaur/regression/composed-stv.lisp').  The documentation tables for STVs
 should now look nicer in the printer-friendly xdoc view.</p>

 <p>In the @(see 4v) library, there are a few new @(see *sexpr-rewrites*).</p>

 <p>Minor bug-fix to avoid complaint in an @(see aignet) @('bind-free')
 routine.</p>

 <p>Added @(see satlink::gather-benchmarks), a plugin for collecting DIMACS
 files that SATLINK sends to the SAT solver. You could use this to gather
 benchmarks for evaluating SAT solvers or for the SAT solving competitions.</p>

 <p>In @(see gl), fixed a bug in @('trace-gl-interp').</p>



 <h3>VL Changes</h3>

 <p>VL has undergone significant extensions and changes, mostly toward extending
 VL to support a subset of SystemVerilog.  VL is intended to also still support
 Verilog-2005, and in many cases its Verilog-2005 support has been improved as
 new SystemVerilog features have been implemented.  Some highlights:</p>

 <ul>

 <li>VL now has a more extensive \"systest\" suite for checking its work against
 NCVerilog and VCS, and a preliminary \"failtest\" suite for ensuring that
 certain modules with bad constructs are properly rejected.</li>

 <li>Added parsing support for many constructs such as interfaces, packages,
 generate statements, structs, unpacked arrays, etc.  The parser functions now
 pass around a \"parse state\" object and generates warnings in a more coherent
 way.  This results in certain speedups to its certification and allows for
 distinguishing the names of data types from other identifiers, which is
 necessary for parsing certain constructs.</li>

 <li>More comprehensive parameter support.  This involved reworking
 unparameterization to handle SystemVerilog data types, and adding support for
 richer expressions in wire ranges, etc., by reworking how constant expressions
 are evaluated to handle many more operators and operands of mixed sizes/types.
 Generate statements are also now supported to some degree.</li>

 <li>Added support for fancier ports, e.g., ports with data types, module
 instances with @('.name') and @('.*') style connections, and interface
 ports.</li>

 <li>Added support for combinational user-defined primitives, and at least basic
 parsing support for sequential UDPs.</li>

 <li>Added some support for SystemVerilog packages and imports.  A new
 \"scopestack\" abstraction is now widely used to provide more comprehensive
 handling of nested scopes (e.g., named begin/end blocks), packages, etc.  There
 is now some support for functions defined at the global scope.</li>

 <li>Sizing has been extended to handle unpacked arrays.  The sizing code has
 been reorganized to be more modular, and extended to handle additional
 operators.</li>

 <li>Miscellaneous improvements.  The pretty-printer has been extended to handle
 the new SystemVerilog constructs, ansi-style ports, etc.  Some transforms are
 more configurable, e.g., gate elimination can easily use alternate replacements
 for gate instances.  There is better support for @('case') statements,
 especially in @('always_comb') blocks.  Various operators are now supported to
 various degrees, e.g., @('++'), casting operators, @('$bits'), streaming
 concatenations.  The preprocessor now supports @('`define') macros with
 arguments.  The hierarchy tools have been greatly simplified.</li>

 <li>Numerous organizational changes, bug fixes, and updates to existing tools
 and transforms to keep things working.</li>

 </ul>

 <p>Besides these improvements to the core library, there have been various
 user interface improvements.  For instance, the @(see vl::vl-server) has been
 entirely rewritten and is now included in the @(see vl::kit); it allows you to
 view Verilog modules in a web browser.  The loader has been made more
 user-friendly and more gracefully handles search paths, errors, etc.  The
 @(see vl::vl-lint)er has been tweaked to provide better output and to run more
 quickly.</p>")

 <h2>Organization, Build, and Licensing Changes</h2>

 <h3>Deleted Stubs</h3>

 <p>When we move a book, we often add a <b>stub</b> book in its previous
 location to help you transition your @(see include-book) commands.  The @(see
 build::cert.pl) build system prints warnings when a stub book is being
 included.</p>

 <p>Stub books have a lifespan of one release.  The following books were stubs
 in ACL2 6.4, so we've deleted them.</p>

 @({
      Previous Location                         New Location
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
      cutil/*.lisp                              std/util/*.lisp

      centaur/bitops/sbitsets                   std/bitsets/sbitsets
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
 })


 <h3>Book Reorganization</h3>

 <p>We've moved several books to new homes in an effort to improve the overall
 organization of the books.  Users of these libraries will need to update their
 @(see include-book) commands, and in some cases, packages have also
 changed.</p>

 <p>The table below shows which libraries have moved and where they have moved
 to.  Books with stubs may continue to work until the next release, but you'll
 need to update your @('include-book')s eventually.</p>


 @({
    Stubs?     Previous Location        New Location
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Yes       str/                     std/strings/

     No        memoize/                 centaur/memoize/

     No        centaur/doc.lisp         doc/top.lisp

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 })

 <p>The @(see defpkg) commands for @(see xdoc), @(see std/strings), @(see
 std/osets), and @(see std/bitsets) have been merged into a single
 @('std/package.lsp') file, with a single corresponding @('std/portcullis.lisp')
 file, to simplify package management.</p>


 <h3>Name Conflict Resolution</h3>

 <p>Preliminary work has been carried out toward unifying coi/std versions of
 osets.  In particular:</p>

 <ul>
 <li>The @(see std/osets) package has been changed from @('SETS') to @('SET').</li>
 <li>The @('coi/osets') library now uses the @('std/osets') package files.</li>
 <li>Some @('coi/osets') books now merely include the corresponding files from
 @('std/osets').</li>
 </ul>

 <p>The @(see std/lists) function @('repeat') has been renamed to @(see
 replicate), and had its arguments reordered, to resolve a name clash with the
 coi library.  See <a
 href='https://code.google.com/p/acl2-books/issues/detail?id=136'>Issue 136</a>
 for additional discussion about this change.</p>

 <p>The @('data-structures') library @('STRUCTURES') package has been renamed to
 @('DEFSTRUCTURE') to resolve a name conflicts with the COI books.</p>

 <p>The @(see bitops) library's @('sign-extend') function has been renamed to
 @(see fast-logext) to resolve a name conflict with the @(see rtl)
 library.</p>

 <p>The new @('tools/book-conflicts') tool can be used to detect name conflicts
 between books.  See its @('README') file for more information.</p>


 <h3>Build System Changes</h3>

 <p>Support for ACL2(r) is now directly included in the top-level Makefile.
 ACL2(r) users no longer need to use a separate build process and can now make
 use of many additional books.  Books that are incompatible with ACL2(r) should
 be annotated with @('non-acl2r') @('cert_param')s, and books that require
 ACL2(r) should have a @('uses-acl2r') cert_param.</p>


 <p>The top-level Makefile has been made more robust in various ways.</p>

 <ul>

 <li>Certification of books under @('models/y86') has a cleaner implementation.
 These books are no longer certified by the @('make') target @('all') since they
 are resource intensive.  For ACL2(h) and host Lisps that can handle this task,
 they are certified by using the target @('everything').  Also, the value of the
 @('-j') option of the @('make') command is no longer ignored.</li>

 <li>It no longer tries to build certain long-running books when USE_QUICKLISP
 is set and Hons is not present.</li>

 <li>It no longer tries to build the @(see gl) solutions book, as this can
 overwhelm modest machines.</li>

 <li>A new @('ccl-only') @('cert_param') can be used for books that require CCL.
 Used this to avoid trying to certify certain books that require, e.g., @(see
 tshell).</li>

 <li>The @(see esim-tutorial) books have been removed from @('doc/top.lisp') to
 avoid requiring Glucose to build the ACL2+Books manual.</li>

 <li>Certain problematic books have been annotated with @(see
 non-parallel-book), to avoid incompatibilities with @(see
 waterfall-parallelism) problems on ACL2(p).</li>

 </ul>


 <p>The @(see build::cert.pl) build system has been enhanced in many ways.  Of
 particular note, it now deals more automatically with portcullis files, which
 may help to improve the reliability of including uncertified files.  Other
 improvements include:</p>

 <ul>
  <li>Better support for generated books</li>
  <li>Support for ACL2 images that start up in other packages</li>
  <li>Enhanced @('--help') message with more information</li>
  <li>Added support for @(see add-include-book-dir!)</li>
  <li>More informative error messages in certain cases</li>
  <li>Miscellaneous, minor bug fixes, e.g., support for @('$') in book names.</li>
 </ul>


 <p>The build speed has been improved in various ways.</p>

 <ul>

 <li>Many books have reordered @(see include-book) to take advantage of new
 optimizations in ACL2.</li>

 <li>The performance of the @('tau/bounders/elementary-bounders') book has been
 significantly improved, reducing the critical path time for the @('make all')
 target.</li>

 <li>A computationally expensive proof has been split out of the
 @('defung-stress') book, also substantially improving the critical path for
 @('make all').</li>

 <li>Reduced dependencies in @(see std/util), @(see std/lists), @(see
 std/alists), and @(see xdoc) to speed up certification.</li>

 </ul>

 <p>Added a TAGS target to the Makefile.</p>

 <p>Added scripts to support using a <a
 href='http://jenkins-ci.org/'>Jenkins</a> continuous integration server to
 continually rebuild ACL2 and the books on various platforms.</p>


 <h3>Licensing Changes</h3>

 <p>Books contributed by Computational Logic, Inc. are now licensed under
 a (more permissive) 3-clause BSD style license instead of the GNU General
 Public License.</p>

 <p>Books contributed by Centaur Technology, Inc. are now licensed under a (more
 permissive) MIT/X11 style license instead of the GNU General Public
 License.</p>

 <p>Books contributed by Jared Davis / Kookamara are now licensed under an
 MIT/X11 style license instead of the GNU General Public License.</p>

 <p>Many books that lacked explicit licensing information have been updated to
 include appropriate copyright headers.</p>


 <h2>New Libraries, Demos, and Documentation</h2>

 <h5>New Libraries and Tools</h5>

 <p>The @('workshops/2014') directory contains contributions from the ACL2
 Workshop for 2014.</p>

 <p>The new @(see remove-hyps) tool may be useful for identifying unnecessary
 hypotheses in theorems.</p>

 <p>@(see fty::fty) is a new library offers functionality similar to @(see std)
 or @(see defdata) libraries.  This library enforces a certain fixing-function
 discipline and may help to avoid many type-like hypotheses on theorems.</p>

 <p>The new book @('tools/rewrite-with-equality.lisp') is a certified clause
 processor that causes certain equality hypotheses to cause massive substitution
 of the \"good\" term for the \"bad\" term in clauses that are stable under
 simplification.</p>

 <p>The new @(see with-supporters) macro can be used to automatically produce
 redundant versions of events that are needed from local include books.</p>

 <p>The new @(see flag::def-doublevar-induction) macro can be used to create
 certain kinds of induction schemes, and may be especially useful for proving
 @(see congruence) rules about mutually recursive functions.</p>

 <p>The new @(see nrev) book is something like @('nreverse').  It can be used to
 implement in-order, tail-recursive list processing functions.  With a trust
 tag, these functions can avoid the memory overhead of a final @(see
 reverse).</p>

 <p>The new @(see fast-alist-pop) function provides something akin to
 @('remhash') for fast alists, with various restrictions and limitations.</p>

 <p>The new @('system/hons-check') books provide some basic tests for the @(see
 hons-and-memoization) code.</p>

 <p>The new @('oracle/') directory contains tools and examples from Oracle,
 Inc.</p>

 <h5>New Demos</h5>

 <p>A new demo, @('demos/tutorial-problems/equivalence-of-two-functions'), shows
 some ways to prove the equivalence of two functions that recur in different
 ways.</p>

 <p>A new demo, @('demos/knuth-bendix-problem-1.lisp'), has been added.</p>

 <p>COI's @('defung') has a new fractran example: see
 @('coi/defung/fractran.lisp').</p>

 <p>A new demo, @('demos/gl-and-use-example.lisp'), shows a way to use GL to
 establish the crux of an unbounded theorem.</p>


 <h5>New Documentation</h5>

 <p>The @('cowles'), @(see arithmetic-1), and @(see rtl) libraries now
 have some XDOC documentation.</p>

 <p>There are now some preliminary recommendations for @(see best-practices) for
 developing ACL2 books.</p>

 <p>The documentation for portions of the @(see ihs) library and @(see plev) had
 been inadvertently excluded from the manual, but are now included.</p>

 <p>A new topic describes some noteworthy @(see clause-processor-tools).</p>

 <p>The topic hierarchy has received some attention, e.g., all topics that were
 formerly listed under the grab-bag @('switches-parameters-and-modes') have been
 relocated to more suitable homes.</p>

 <p>Converted the documentation for @(see esim), @(see b*), and other topics
 into @(see xdoc) format.</p>

 <p>Many topics have been improved by eliminating typos, making minor
 clarifications, adding appropriate cross-references, fixing broken links, and
 ensuring that @(':parents') are correct.</p>



 <h2>Changes to Major Libraries</h2>

 <h3>XDOC Changes</h3>

 <p>The new @(see xdoc::order-subtopics) command can be used to control the
 order that subtopics are presented in.</p>

 <p>The \"classic\" XDOC viewer is no longer supported.</p>

 <p>The XDOC viewers have been improved in many ways.</p>

 <ul>

 <li>Fancy manuals now produce a clear error message for users of IE8 and IE9,
 and will work properly for users of IE11.  (IE10 still works, as before).</li>

 <li>Fancy manuals now load much more quickly (faster jump-to box
 initialization).</li>

 <li>The :doc command and the @(see acl2-doc) tool now show URLs for external
 links.</li>

 <li>XDOC now includes tools that can create a <a
 href='http://www.sitemaps.org/'>sitemap</a> and other \"static\" HTML files,
 which may be useful for search engine optimization.</li>

 <li>Added @('.htaccess') files to fancy manuals, which can enable server-side
 compression for significant file size/performance improvements.</li>

 </ul>


 <p>Various bugs have also been fixed in the core XDOC system.</p>

 <ul>

 <li>The @('@(def ...)') directive sometimes printed the wrong event; this has
 been fixed.  It also now handles mutually recursive functions more nicely.</li>

 <li>The @(see xdoc::save) command should no longer cause an error when trying
 to write manuals to paths like @('~/my-manual').</li>

 <li>Fixed bugs in XDOC's handling of <tt>@@('...')</tt> and <tt>@@({...})</tt>
 directives, and otherwise improved error messages with more context.</li>

 <li>Fixed a problem with @(see xdoc::xdoc-extend) when the topic to extend
 lacked a @(':long') string.</li>

 </ul>

 <p>Other minor changes:</p>

 <ul>

 <li>XDOC now uses @(see str::pretty) instead of @(see fmt-to-string) and the
 preprocessor uses @(see state) less than before.</li>

 <li>Factored xdoc tests out of the main directory and excluded them from the
 basic build, to improve build times.</li>

 </ul>



 <h3>@(csee Std) Library Changes</h3>

 <h5>@(see std/basic)</h5>

 <p>A new book of basic @(see induction-schemes) has been added.</p>

 <p>Certain equivalence relations like @(see chareqv) and @(see streqv) have
 been factored out of the @(see std/strings) library and moved into
 @('std/basic') instead, mainly to improve integration with the new @(see
 fty::fty) library.</p>

 <p>@(see lnfix) and @(see lifix) are now enabled, inlined functions instead of
 macros.  This may help to simplify guard obligations in functions that call
 @('lnfix') and @('lifix').</p>


 <h5>@(see std/lists)</h5>

 <p>An @(see std/lists/update-nth) book has been added.</p>

 <p>A @('remove-duplicates') book has been added with lemmas about @(see
 remove-duplicates-equal) and @(see hons-remove-duplicates).</p>

 <p>Added a missing rule about @(see acl2-count) to
 @('std/lists/acl2-count').</p>

 <p>@(see uniquep) no longer uses @(see equality-variants).  Theorems that
 target @('uniquep') should be rewritten in terms of @('no-duplicatesp').</p>

 <p>Various books have been reorganized to reduce dependencies.</p>


 <h5>@(see std/alists)</h5>

 <p>The general purpose alist functions @(see append-alist-vals) and @(see
 append-alist-keys) have been moved out of @(see vl) and into @(see
 std/alists).</p>

 <p>There are new books for @(see alist-fix) and @(see hons-remove-assoc).</p>

 <p>The new @('fast-alist-clean') book includes lemmas about @(see
 fast-alist-fork) and @(see fast-alist-clean).</p>

 <p>Various books have been reorganized to reduce dependencies.</p>


 <h5>@(see std/osets)</h5>

 <p>Most osets functions are now disabled by default.  They can be re-enabled
 using the ruleset @('set::definitions').</p>

 <p>Some useful but sometimes expensive rules, including for instance the @(see
 set::pick-a-point-subset-strategy) and @(see set::double-containment), and also
 including other rules such as the transitivity of @(see set::subset), are now
 disabled by default.  They can be re-enabled using the ruleset
 @('set::expensive-rules').</p>


 <h5>@(see std/util)</h5>

 <p>Some new macros have been added.</p>

 <ul>

 <li>@(see std::defines) can introduce mutually recursive functions, using a
 @(see std::define)-like syntax, and features automatic integration with @(see
 make-flag).</li>

 <li>@(see std::defval) is like @(see defconst) but has @(see xdoc) integration.</li>

 <li>@(see std::defsum) is a preliminary macro for tagged union types.</li>

 <li>@(see std::defaggrify-defrec) adds @(see std::defaggregate)-style emulation
 for structures introduced using @('defrec').</li>

 </ul>


 <p>The @(see std::define) macro has been improved in many ways.</p>

 <ul>

 <li>It has been modified to make it easier to extend, largely in support of
 @(see std::defines).</li>

 <li>It now uses @(see with-output) to avoid printing so much output.</li>

 <li>Theorems introduced by @(see std::returns-specifiers) now often have better
 names, and the name can also be controlled using @(':name').</li>

 <li>The new @(see std::more-returns) macro allows for additional @(see
 std::returns-specifiers) style theorems after a @('define').</li>

 <li>A performance bug with the @(see std::var-is-stobj-p) function, notably
 used by @('define'), has been fixed.</li>

 <li>Experimental <i>post-define hooks</i> can allow for custom actions to be
 carried out after submitting a @('define'); such a hook allows for a tight
 integration between @('define') and the new @(see fty::fty) library.</li>

 <li>New options allow you to avoid introducing an encapsulate and to name and
 save the termination proof.</li>

 </ul>

 <p>Other macros have also been improved in various ways.</p>

 <ul>

 <li>@(see std::defredundant) tool has been expanded to better handle @(see
 mutual-recursion) and <see topic='@(url macro-aliases-table)'>macro
 aliases</see>.</li>

 <li>@(see std::defmvtypes) now has smarter handling of @(see force).</li>

 <li>@(see std::defenum) now automatically produces a fixing function and
 forward-chaining rule to give the possible values of the objects.</li>

 <li>@(see std::defrule) now has a @(':local') option.</li>

 <li>@(see std::deflist) is now smart enough to tell whether functions are
 defined; its former @(':already-definedp') option is now useless and, hence,
 deprecated.</li>

 <li>@(see std::defprojection) now uses @(see nrev::nrev) instead of optimizing
 things with @('nreverse') directly, reducing the use of trust tags.</li>

 <li>@(see std::defprojection) now accepts @(see std::define)-like syntax for
 @(see std::extended-formals) and @(see std::returns-specifiers).</li>

 <li>A bug with @(see std::defprojection)'s @('subsetp') theorem has been
 fixed.</li>

 </ul>

 <p>Many macros now have a @(':verbosep') option that can be used to disable
 output suppression.</p>

 <p>The @('std/util') testing code has been factored out into a new
 @('std/util/tests') directory.</p>



 <h5>@(see std/typed-lists)</h5>

 <p>There are now books for many built-in ACL2 list recognizers that were
 previously not covered, e.g., @(see boolean-listp), @(see integer-listp),
 etc.</p>


 <h5>@(see std/strings)</h5>

 <p>Many logical definitions throughout the @(see std/strings) library have been
 cleaned up.  Also, many definitions have been changed to use @(see std::define)
 for better documentation.</p>

 <p>The new book @('std/strings/defs-program') contains @(see program) mode
 definitions of most functions in the @('std/strings') library.</p>

 <p>The new @(see str::pretty) routine can convert arbitrary ACL2 objects into
 pretty-printed strings.  Is a fast, state-free, logic mode reimplementation of
 much of ACL2's pretty printer.</p>

 <p>There are now a much richer collection of numeric functions, especially for
 non-decimal bases; see @(see str::numbers).</p>

 <p>The string library now has a very efficient, bitset-like way to represent
 sets of characters, and some functions for working with these character
 sets. See @(see str::charset-p).</p>


 <h5>@(see std/io)</h5>

 <p>The @(see read-string) function will now produce better error messages and
 can (optionally, via raw Lisp) avoid checking @('bad-lisp-objectp'). </p>


 <h3>Defdata Changes</h3>

 <p>Defdata's output has been tweaked.</p>

 <p>The @(see defdata) library now supports range types.</p>

 <p>Counterexample generation has been updated to use tau instead of the former
 @('graph-tc') book, and has many other updates.</p>


 <h3>COI Changes</h3>

 <p>COI's @('def::signature') macro now has support for generalized
 congruences.</p>



 <h3>@(see Quicklisp) and @(see OSLIB)</h3>

 <p>The experimental @(see quicklisp) build has been updated in many ways.
 Quicklisp files are now installed under the @('centaur/quicklisp/inst')
 directory instead of the user's home directory.</p>

 <p>The Quicklisp install can be carried out using a proxy.</p>

 <p>The @(see quicklisp) books now include support for the @('bordeaux-threads')
 and @('hunchentoot') libraries.</p>

 <p>@(see oslib::getpid) has been extended to work on Lisps other than CCL.</p>

 <p>Added minimal tests to @(see oslib) functions such as @(see
 oslib::file-kind) and @(see oslib::date).</p>

 <p>OSLIB has new @(see oslib::lisp-type) and @(see oslib::lisp-version) functions.</p>

 <p>A new book, @('centaur/misc/sharedlibs'), may be useful for relocating @(see
 save-exec) images that require shared libraries for CCL/Linux systems.</p>

 <p>We have remove dependencies on @('iolib') since its build does not seem to
 be reliable.</p>


 <h2>Changes to Centaur Libraries</h2>


 <h3>@(see GL::GL) Changes</h3>

 <p>The @('rtl9') library has been updated to better support GL.</p>

 <p>GL has better @(see if) handling, and as a result may be better able to cope
 with unsatisfiable path conditions (i.e., unreachable code regions) when using
 SAT-based @(see gl::modes).</p>

 <p>New @(see gl::preferred-definitions) may slightly improve performance of
 bit-vector operations like @(see logcar), @(see logcdr), @(see loghead), and
 @(see logtail).</p>

 <p>Some symbolic arithmetic functions have been changed so as to possibly
 improve AIG performance.</p>

 <p>GL's rewrites to @(see 4v) constants have been improved.</p>

 <p>The new macro @(see gl::gl-thm) is like @(see gl::def-gl-thm), but doesn't
 store the theorem.  That is, it's like @(see thm) is to @(see defthm).
 Similarly, @(see gl::gl-param-thm) is to @(see gl::def-gl-param-thm), and @(see
 gl::def-gl-rule) is similar to @(see std::defrule).</p>

 <p>The definitions of @('def-gl-thm'), etc., have been simplified, @(see
 gl::gl-hint) can now be told which GL clause processor to use.</p>

 <p>Minor bugs have been fixed.</p>
 <ul>

 <li>GL's @(see gl::def-gl-rewrite) macro has been reworked to avoid the
 possibility of dropping rules when books are included in different orders.</li>

 <li>The GL interpreter now uses the @('clk') from the given @(see
 gl::glcp-config).</li>

 </ul>

 <p>The documentation for GL has been generally improved.</p>


 <h3>@(see VL) Verilog Toolkit</h3>

 <p>VL has been significantly refactored.  All of the internal @(see vl::syntax)
 is now based on @(see fty::fty), which is a major change.  The representation
 of @(see vl::statements) is especially different.</p>

 <p>VL is beginning to gain support for some limited SystemVerilog constructs.
 This is a major change that affects all areas, e.g., lexing, parsing, syntax,
 and transformations.</p>

 <p>VL now support certain kinds of combinational always blocks.  It also
 supports richer edge-triggered always blocks, including, e.g., registers with
 asynchronous set/reset signals.</p>

 <p>Many bugs have been fixed, some severe.  For instance, VL was incorrectly
 translating BUF, NOT, and XNOR gates with \"extra\" terminals.  The new VL
 @('systest') directory includes various end-to-end tests of VL's translations
 of certain modules.</p>

 <p>Warnings have been improved.  For instance, VL now warns about 0-bit
 replications since some Verilog tools do not implement them correctly.</p>

 <p>Many ttags have been removed from VL, using @(see nrev::nrev).</p>

 <p>VL's always/delay transforms can now optionally produce less bitblasted
 modules.</p>

 <p>The @(see vl::kit) includes new commands such as @('vl gather') and many
 commands have additional options.  It also now prints backtraces on errors for
 improved debugging.</p>

 <p>Numerous other minor bug fixes, extensions, performance improvements,
 etc.</p>


 <h3>Other Centaur Libraries</h3>

 <p>@(see satlink) now uses @('glucose-cert') instead of @('lingeling') as the
 default SAT solver.</p>

 <p>The default @(see sexpr-rewriting) rules have been expanded and improved.
 These changes may improve decomposition proofs and also the performance of
 GL-based STV proofs.</p>

 <p>@(see tshell) should now handle interrupts more reliably.</p>

 <p>The executable counterparts of @(see symbolic-test-vectors) are now disabled
 by default.</p>

 <p>There is now better support for decomposition proofs of @(see
 symbolic-test-vectors), see files such as
 @('centaur/esim/stv/stv-decomp-proofs*') and
 @('centaur/regression/composed-stv.lisp').</p>

 <p>The new @(see stv-run-for-all-dontcares) function is a less conservative
 alternative to @(see stv-run).</p>

 <p>Some lemmas have been localized in @(see esim).</p>

 <p>@(see aignet) now has a basic @('aignet-print') function for debugging.</p>

 <p>The @(see bridge::json-encoding) routines now use @(see define) for better
 documentation.</p>

 <p>Some @(see aignet) functions and @('numlist') are now tail recursive.</p>

 <p>The @(see bitops) @('ihsext-basics') book has additional rules about @(see
 lognot) and @(see logmask).</p>

 <p>Improved and documented the @(see logbitp-reasoning) hint.</p>

 <p>Added @(see bit->bool) to the @(see bitops) library.</p>

 <p>The new @('centaur/bitops/contrib') directory contains additional lemmas.</p>


 <h2>Other Changes</h2>

 <p>(File interface/emacs/inf-acl2.el) One now gets a clear error, suggesting a
 solution, when Emacs command @('meta-x run-acl2') cannot find an ACL2
 executable.  Thanks to Scott Staley for helpful correspondence leading to this
 fix.</p>

 <p>The @(see make-flag) tool now uses slightly faster, more robust hints.</p>

 <p>The @(see witness-cp) clause processor has been made more flexible.</p>

 <p>The @('clause-processors/unify-subst') and @('clause-processors/generalize')
 books have been reworked to avoid nearly duplicate definitions.</p>

 <p>The @(see def-universal-equiv) macro now takes an @('already-definedp')
 option.</p>

 <p>The @('demos/patterened-congruences.lisp') book has been improved.</p>

 <p>The book @('centaur/misc/intern-debugging') book has been modified and
 should now be generally unnecessary, thanks to CCL improvements which have
 resolved the problems it was intended to warn about.</p>

 <p>Something happened to profiling.lisp in r2423.</p>

 <p>@(see disassemble$) now supports macro aliases.</p>

 <p>Several ordinary files that were incorrectly marked as executable are now
 properly non-executable.</p>

 <p>The tau @('elementary-bounders') book has been extended with additional
 lemmas about @(see expt) for powers of 2.</p>



 <h2>Changes to ACL2(r) Books</h2>

 <p>Many explicit function definitions have been replaced with constraints, in
 order to make theorems about those functions more useful for functional
 instantiation later.  For example, instead of insisting that @('(f+g)(x)') is
 really equal to @('f(x) + g(x)'), this is now only required for valid values of
 @('x').</p>

 <p>The theory of integration is now updated to conform to the current version
 of continuity and differentiability (which allows functions that are only
 continuous or differentiable over a particular domain).</p>

 <p>The concepts of continuity, differentiability, and integration now have both
 non-standard and classical definitions.  These are shown to be equivalent for
 classical functions without parameters.  Even when parameters are present, the
 classical definitions can be used to take advantage of important theorems, such
 as the intermediate-value theorem, mean-value theorem, fundamental theorem of
 calculus, etc.</p>")

  :short "Release notes for the ACL2 Community Books for ACL2 6.4 (January,
 2013)."

  :long "<p>The following is a brief summary of changes made to the @(see
 community-books) between the releases of ACL2 6.3 and 6.4.  See the <a
 href='https://code.google.com/p/acl2-books/wiki/ReleaseVersionNumbers'>acl2-books
 Wiki page on ReleaseVersionNumbers</a> for svn revision numbers corresponding
 to releases.  See also @(see note-6-4) for the changes made to ACL2 itself.</p>

 <p>For additional details, you may also see the raw <a
 href='http://code.google.com/p/acl2-books/source/list'>commit log</a>.</p>


 <h3>Build System Changes</h3>

 <p>In previous versions of ACL2, the default @('make') command for building the
 Community Books could take several hours.  Starting in ACL2 6.4, the default
 build is much faster because it <b>excludes many books</b>.</p>

 <p>This particularly affects what happens when you run @('make') from the
 @('books') directory.  We have <i>not</i> changed how @('make regression')
 works from the @('acl2-sources') directory&mdash;it still builds (nearly) all
 of the books.</p>

 <p>See @(see books-certification) for details about how to use the new build
 system.</p>


 <h3>Deleted Stubs</h3>

 <p>When we move a book, we often add a <b>stub</b> book in its previous
 location to help you transition your @(see include-book) commands.  The @(see
 build::cert.pl) build system prints warnings when a stub book is being
 included.</p>

 <p>Stub books have a lifespan of one release.  The following books were stubs
 in ACL2 6.3, so we've deleted them.</p>

 <h3>Book Reorganization</h3>

 <p>We've moved several books to new homes in an effort to clean up the
 top-level @('books') directory.  Users of these libraries will need to update
 their @(see include-book) commands, and in some cases, packages may have also
 changed.</p>

 <p>The table below shows which libraries have moved and where they have moved
 to.  Books with stubs may continue to work until the next release, but you'll
 need to update your @('include-book')s eventually.</p>

 <h3>Deprecated Books</h3>

 <p>We've deleted the RTL @('rel7') and @('rel8') directories; please upgrade to
 @('rtl/rel9').  Note that @('rel8') is essentially part of @('rel9'), so if you
 can't directly upgrade to @('rel9'), you may try replacing</p>

 @({
     (include-book \"rtl/rel8/lib/top\" :dir :system)
 })

 <p>with</p>

 @({
     (include-book \"rtl/rel9/support/lib3/top\" :dir :system)
     (include-book \"rtl/rel9/arithmetic/top\" :dir :system)
 })



 <h3>Scripts Moved</h3>

 <p>We've moved many build scripts like @(see build::cert.pl), @('clean.pl'),
 and @('critpath.pl') from the top-level @('books') directory, into a new
 @('books/build') directory.  You may need to update paths to these files in
 your Makefiles or other build scripts.</p>



 <h3>Documentation Changes</h3>

 <p>The ACL2 system documentation has been extracted from the ACL2 sources,
 converted into @(see xdoc) format, and is now located in the Community Books.
 This allows for a tighter integration between the system and book
 documentation, e.g., system topics like @(see io) can now directly link to
 related libraries like @(see std/io).  See @(see note-6-4) for details; and see
 especially the file @('system/doc/acl2-doc.lisp').</p>

 <p>A new, feature-rich Emacs-based documentation browser named @(see acl2-doc)
 has been developed by Matt Kaufmann, and has many features.</p>

 <p>We've added at least some minimal @(see xdoc) documentation for several
 @(see projects): see @(see concurrent-programs), @(see des), @(see equational),
 @(see jfkr), @(see milawa), @(see paco), @(see leftist-trees), @(see
 sha-2), @(see taspi), and @(see wp-gen).</p>

 <p>We've added significant documentation for many books and utilities,
 including at least:</p>

 <ul>
 <li>@(see build::cert.pl) - a build system for certifying ACL2 books</li>
 <li>@(see defconsts) - like @('defconst') but supports stobjs, state, and multiple values</li>
 <li>@(see defrstobj) - a macro for introducing record-like stobjs</li>
 <li>@(see bitops) - an arithmetic library especially for bit-vector arithmetic</li>
 <li>@(see def-universal-equiv) - a macro for universally quantified equivalences</li>
 <li>@(see arith-equivs) - equivalence relations for naturals, integers, and bits</li>
 <li>@(see set-max-mem) - a memory management scheme for ccl</li>
 <li>@(see str::base64) - base64 string encoding/decoding</li>
 </ul>

 <p>We've made hundreds of other minor documentation improvements, and we invite
 everyone to contribute improvements.</p>
