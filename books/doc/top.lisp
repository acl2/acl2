;; Note about the following commented-out form.  This allows a significant
;; reduction of memory usage by this book: of ~130 million conses in the ACL2
;; world after all books are loaded, 51 million are due to tau automatically
;; computing implicants from theorems/definitions -- 42 million conses are
;; stored in various POS-IMPLICANTS and 9.2 million in various NEG-IMPLICANTS
;; properties.  So overriding the default setting of tau-auto-mode saves a
;; significant amount of memory when loading this book.  Question is whether
;; it's worth the cheating.

(defun fix-redundant-acl2-parents (all-topics)

; Modification 7/19/2015 by Matt K.: The rebinding of topic just below caused
; the removal of ACL2 as a parent for three topics, as indicated in the
; following output in books/doc/top.cert.out:

; Note: Removing 'redundant' ACL2 parent for PROOF-AUTOMATION.
; Note: Removing 'redundant' ACL2 parent for INTERFACING-TOOLS.
; Note: Removing 'redundant' ACL2 parent for DEBUGGING.

; But I definitely want DEBUGGING to show up under ACL2.  One reason is that
; otherwise, many ACL2 topics quite appropriately have DEBUGGING as their sole
; parent, and thus are not included in the tree of topics under ACL2.  I'd
; prefer that INTERFACING-TOOLS to show up under ACL2 as well (for example, so
; that COMMAND-LINE is in the tree of topics under ACL2).  But I agree that
; ther is no reason for PROOF-AUTOMATION to be under ACL2, so I have removed

; The following assumes that the community books are in the books/ subdirectory
; of the local ACL2 distribution.  We use the same environment variable,
; TAGS_ACL2_DOC, as is used in the ACL2 top-level GNUmakefile to determine
; whether or not to build tags table TAGS-acl2-doc.  However, by default, here
; want to build TAGS-acl2-doc.  So rather than checking that the environment
; variable value is neither undefined (which it will be for most users) nor the
; empty string, here we check against a special value, SKIP.  So for example,
; the build server can set TAGS_ACL2_DOC to SKIP in order to avoid building
; TAGS-acl2-doc, an operation that apparently (as of June 2017) can cause an
; out-of-memory-error.

; If we find that users complain about out-of-memory errors here, we could test
; below against the empty string (or nil) instead, and users who want
; TAGS-acl2-doc could explicitly set TAGS_ACL2_DOC if they want the tags table.

; It is sometimes useful to make tweaks to the documentation and then quickly
; be able to see your changes.  This macro can be used to do this, as follows:
;
; SETUP:
;
;  (ld "doc.lisp")  ;; slow, takes a few minutes to get all the books loaded
;
; DEVELOPMENT LOOP: {
;
;   1. make documentation changes in new-doc.lsp; e.g., you can add new topics
;      there with defxdoc, or use commands like change-parents, etc.
;
;   2. type (doc-rebuild) to rebuild the manual with your changes; this only
;      takes 20-30 seconds
;
;   3. view your changes, make further edits
;
; }
;
; Finally, move your changes out of new-doc.lsp and integrate them properly
; into the other sources, and do a proper build.
