  :long "<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><b>Witness-cp</b> is an extensible @(see clause-processor) that can apply
user-supplied rules to carry out <i>witnessing transformations</i> on
quantifier-like terms in ACL2 proof goals.</p>

<p>Witness-cp is a general purpose tool that you can configure to work with any
kinds of quantifiers.  As a familiar example, consider set reasoning.  If we
encounter some proof goal with a hypothesis of the form:</p>

@({
   (subsetp-equal x y)
})

<p>then we may want to use this hypothesis to draw specific conclusions, such
as:</p>

@({
    (implies (member-equal k x)
             (member-equal k y))
})

<p>for various @('k').  Similarly if we have a hypothesis of the form:</p>

@({
    (not (subsetp-equal y z))
})

<p>then we may wish to conclude facts such as:</p>

@({
    (and (member-equal j y)
         (not (member-equal j z)))
})

<p>for various @('j').  Many theorems in set theory can be proven by choosing
suitable @('j') and @('k') and then carrying out membership reasoning.  The
@('witness-cp') clause processor can be configured to automatically try such
@('j') and @('k') in reasonably smart ways.</p>

<p>More broadly, @('witness-cp') is a general purpose tool that can configured
to reason about arbitrary quantified formulas.  It knows nothing <i>a
priori</i> about set theory or any other domain, but it can be told about what
predicates are to be taken as universal/existential quantifiers and how they
should be instantiated.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>There are two steps to using @('witness-cp').  First, we must configure it
to understand the desired domain, e.g., for set theory, we would need to
explain that @('subsetp-equal') is the universal quantification of
@('member-equal').  Once the domain is configured, we can instruct ACL2 to
apply the @('witness-cp') clause processor to particular goals that we want to
solve; this is typically done with an explicit @(see witness) hint or via @(see
default-hints).</p>

<p>At a high level, when @('witness-cp') transforms a proof goal, it carries
out the following steps, each of which need to be configured to understand your
domain:</p>

<ol>

<li><b>Witnessing</b>.  Introduce witnesses for negative occurrences of
universally quantified predicates and positive occurrences of existentially
quantified ones.  Then, optionally, for better readability, generalize the
newly introduced witness terms into fresh variables.  These steps can be
controlled with @(see defwitness).</li>

<li><b>Gathering</b>. Find the set of examples with which to instantiate
positive universally quantified and negative existentially quantified
predicates.  The predicates to target are controlled by @(see
definstantiate).</li>

<li><b>Instantiation</b>.  Instantiate these predicates with these examples.
The examples are set up using @(see defexample).</li>

</ol>

<p>Note that witness introduction and instantiation may both be lossy, i.e.,
they may result in a formula that isn't a theorem even if the original formula
is one!</p>


<h3>Extended Example: Set Theory</h3>

<p>We now run through a typical example of setting up @('witness-cp') to
understand some functions from set theory.</p>

<h5>Configuring Witnessing</h5>

<p>To set up witnessing for @('(not (subsetp-equal a b))') hypotheses, we can
issue the following @(see defwitness) event.  We assume here that
@('(subsetp-equal-witness a b)') is a suitable ``badguy'' function that finds a
member of @('a') that is not in @('b'), if one exists.</p>

@({
    (defwitness subsetp-witnessing
      :predicate (not (subsetp-equal a b))
      :expr (and (member-equal (subsetp-equal-witness a b) a)
                 (not (member-equal (subsetp-equal-witness a b) b)))
      :generalize (((subsetp-equal-witness a b) . ssew))
      :hints ('(:in-theory '(subsetp-equal-witness-correct))))
})

<p>This instructs @('witness-cp'), during the witnessing phase, to search for
hypotheses of the form @('(not (subsetp-equal a b))').  For any such matches,
@('witness-cp') will add the new hypothesis:</p>

@({
   (and (member-equal (subsetp-equal-witness a b) a)
        (not (member-equal (subsetp-equal-witness a b) b)))
})

<p>and will then generalize away the term @('(subsetp-equal-witness a b)') to a
fresh variable with a name like @('SSEW0'), @('SSEW1'), etc.  After this
generalization we are left with two new hyps:</p>

@({
     (member-equal ssew0 a)
     (not (member-equal ssew0 b))
})

<p>The net result of all of this is that we have replaced an existential
assumption with a fresh variable witnessing it.  We wrap @('(hide ...)') around
the original hypothesis to leave a trace of what we've done.  (Otherwise, it
would likely be rewritten away, since the two new hyps imply it.)</p>

<p>Why is it sound to add these new hypotheses to our main formula?  To justify
this step, the @(see defwitness) event requires us to prove the following
theorem, using the provided hints:</p>

@({
   (implies (not (subsetp-equal a b))
            (and (member-equal (subsetp-equal-witness a b) a)
                 (not (member-equal (subsetp-equal-witness a b) b))))
})


<h5>Configuring Gathering</h5>

<p>To set up instantiation of a @('(subsetp-equal a b)') hypotheses, we can
issue the following @(see definstantiate) event.</p>

@({
    (definstantiate subsetp-equal-instancing
      :predicate (subsetp-equal a b)
      :vars (k)
      :expr (implies (member-equal k a)
                     (member-equal k b))
      :hints ('(:in-theory '(subsetp-member))))
})

<p>This will mean that, for each @('(subsetp-equal a b)') hypothesis we find,
we'll add hypotheses of the form:</p>

@({
     (implies (member-equal k a)
              (member-equal k b))
})

<p>for each of (possibly) several @('k').  The terms we use to instantiate
@('k') are determined by @(see defexample); see below.</p>

<p>To show that it sound to add these hypotheses, the @(see definstantiate)
event requires us to prove:</p>

@({
    (implies (subsetp-equal a b)
             (implies (member-equal k a)
                      (member-equal k b)))
})

<p>This is a very easy proof: it is just the quantifier-based definition of
@('subsetp-equal').</p>


<h5>Configuring Instantiation</h5>

<p>The terms used to instantiate @('k') above are determined by @(see
defexample) rules, like the following:</p>

@({
    (defexample subsetp-member-template
      :pattern (member-equal k a)
      :templates (k)
      :instance-rulename subsetp-equal-instancing)
})

<p>This rule means that, after the gathering phase, we'll look through the
clause for expressions @('(member-equal k a)') and, whenever we find one,
include @('k') in the list of examples to use for instantiating using the
@('subsetp-equal-instance') rule.</p>

<p>@('Defexample') doesn't require any proof obligation; it's just a heuristic
that adds to the set of terms used to instantiate universal quantifiers.</p>


<h5>Applying the Clause Processor</h5>

<p>To use the scheme we've introduced for reasoning about @('subsetp-equal'),
we can introduce a <b>witness ruleset</b>:</p>

@({
   (def-witness-ruleset subsetp-witnessing-rules
     '(subsetp-witnessing
       subsetp-equal-instancing
       subsetp-member-template))
})

<p>Then when we want to use this reasoning strategy, we can give a hint.  You
should not call @('witness-cp') directly, but rather using the @(see witness)
macro as a computed hint.  For example:</p>

@({
    :hints ((witness :ruleset subsetp-witnessing-rules))
})

<p>This implicitly waits until the formula is @(see
stable-under-simplificationp) and then invokes the @('witness-cp') clause
processor, allowing it to use the witnessing/instancing/example rules
listed.</p>

<p>You may find it useful to define a macro so that you don't have to remember
this syntax, for instance:</p>

@({
   (defmacro subset-reasoning ()
     '(witness :ruleset subsetp-witnessing-rules))

   (defthm foo
     ...
     :hints ((\"goal\" ...)
             (subset-reasoning)))
})


<h3>Further Resources</h3>

<p>Additional documentation is available for @(see defwitness), @(see
definstantiate), and @(see defexample). Also see @(see defquantexpr), which is
a shortcut for the common pattern (as above) of doing both a defwitness and
definstantiate for a certain term, and @(see defquant), which defines a
quantified function (using @(see defun-sk)) and sets up
defwitness/definstantiate rules for it.</p>")

;; name: name of the witness rule
;; term: predicate term to match against
;; expr: expression implied by the predicate.
;; restriction: term in terms of the free vars of the predicate which
;;    will be evaluated with those variables bound to their matching
;;    terms; the witnessing will not be done if this evaluates to NIL
;; hint: hint to use to prove the resulting obligation.
;; generalize-exprs:  alist mapping subterms of EXPR to symbols; these
;;    will be generalized away to similar symbols.

;; Returns:
;; list of witnessing terms
;; alist (term . symbol) for generalization
;; list of proof obligations.

;; Example: lit is (subsetp-equal a b), i.e. hyp is
;; (not (subsetp-equal a b))
;; new hyp is:
;; (and (member-equal (car (set-difference-equal a b)) a)

<p>The above example tells @('witness-cp') to expand any hypothesis of the
form (not (subsetp-equal a b)) or, equivalently, any conclusion of the

that represents an object that proves that A is not a subset of B (because that
object is in A but not B.)</p>

<p>The @('name') of the rule can be used in Witness Rulesets; see @(see

<p>When @(see witness-cp) is given a Witness Ruleset that includes @('name'),
it will look for literals in the clause that unify with the negation of
@('predicate').  It will replace these by a term generated from @('expr').  It
will then generalize away terms that are keys in @('generalize'), replacing
them by fresh variables based on their corresponding values.  It will use
@('hints') to relieve the proof obligation that this replacement is sound,
which is also done when the @('defwitness') form is run.</p>

<h5>Additional Arguments</h5>

<p>You can syntactically restrict the application of a witness rule by giving a
@('restriction').  The @('restriction') term may have free variables that occur
also in the @('predicate') term, and may also use the variable @('acl2::world')

<p>the values bound to each key in :witnesses should be witnesses for the
