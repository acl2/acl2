<p>@('Unequiv') takes two arguments and always returns @('T').  It is an
equivalence relation; in fact, it is the equivalence relation for which every
other equivalence relation is a refinement.</p>

<p>In FGL, if the rewriter enters an @('unequiv') equivalence context, there
are several tools that can be used that can't be used under other equivalence
contexts.  These tools include extralogical forms such as @('syntax-interp'),
@('fgl-interp-obj'), and @('assume').  The rewriter can also apply rules whose
equivalence relation is @('unequiv'), meaning the LHS and RHS don't actually
need to be related at all.  When the rewriter is under an @('unequiv') context
it essentially means that whatever it computes there can't be relevant to the
truth or falsity of the theorem under consideration, so it can do whatever the
user asks it to do.</p>

  :long "<p>Logically, @('(binder val)') just returns @('val').  However, in
FGL, the intended use is to bind a free variable in a rewrite rule to the
result of some computation with some particular properties.  The @('val')
argument must be a function--say @('bindingfn')--whose first argument is a
variable @('var') and which has either a binder rule of the following form:
@({
 (implies (and ... hyps ...
               (equiv2 var (binding-impl-term ...)))
          (equiv1 (bindingfn var arg1 ... argn) var))
 })
or else a binder metafunction associated with it.  In the first case (and assuming we
are in an @('equiv1') equiv context),
@({
 (binder (bindingfn var val1 ... valn))
 })
results in @('var') being bound to the result of symbolically interpreting
@('(binding-impl-term ...)') under the substitution binding @('argi') to
@('vali') and in the @('equiv2') context.  In the second case, the binder
metafunction is applied to the symbolic values @('val1 ... valn'), resulting in
a term, bindings, and equivalence context; @('var') is bound to the result of
symbolically interpreting the term under the bindings in the equivalence
context.</p>

<p>An example application is to check whether the symbolic value of some term
is syntactically an integer.  We define @('(check-integerp var x)') to be
@('(and (integerp x) var)') and associate this with a binding metafunction that
returns T if @('x') is syntactically an integer.  Another application is to
perform a SAT check and return the result (@(':unsat'), @(':sat'), or
@(':failed')).</p>" val)
