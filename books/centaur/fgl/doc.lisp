<p>FGL is the successor to <see topic='@(url acl2::gl)'>GL</see>.  It mainly
consists of a clause processor that calls on a custom rewriter/term interpreter
which features support for efficient representations of Boolean functions.
Compared to GL, FGL offers the following new features:</p>

<ul>

<li>Support for representing Boolean functions using the @(see
aignet::aignet) package.</li>

<li>Support for calling incremental SAT during rewriting/symbolic execution.</li>

<li>Less functionality included in built-in primitives, but better able to be
programmed using rewrite rules and user-provided extensions.</li>

<li>Explicit representation of the entire interpreter state,
allowing global simplifications (e.g. combinational-equivalence-preserving
AIGNET transformations).</li>

<li>The symbolic object representation includes a new primitive kind
representing a fast alist or array.</li>

<li>Better debugging capabilities, including a tracing facility for the
rewriter and the ability to examine the full interpreter stack at any
point.</li>

</ul>

<p>FGL is currently missing some important features of GL.  In particular, BDD
and hons-AIG modes are not complete.  Shape specifiers don't exist yet.  Many
of the usual ways of doing things in GL are done differently in FGL.</p>

<p>To get started with FGL in the default configuration, first set up a <see
topic='@(url satlink::sat-solver-options)'>SAT solver</see>; the default for
FGL is glucose.  To use a different SAT solver, see @(see fgl-solving).</p>

 @({
 ;; include FGL
 (include-book \"centaur/fgl/top\" :dir :system)

 ;; start an external shell from which the SAT solver can be called
 (value-triple (acl2::tshell-ensure))

 ;; test a proof 
 (fgl::fgl-thm
   :hyp (and (unsigned-byte-p 5 x) (unsigned-byte-p 5 y))
   :concl (equal (+ x y) (+ y x)))

 (fgl::def-fgl-thm my-silly-theorem
  :hyp (unsigned-byte-p 3 x)
  :concl (not (logbitp 4 x)))
 })
 
<p>In addition to a standalone SAT solver program (monolithic solver), for
certain FGL features you may also want an incremental solver implementing the
IPASIR interface; see @(see ipasir::ipasir) for an overview and
(see ipasir::building-an-ipasir-solver-library) for how to build one.  Then
you'll need to set the environment variable @('IPASIR_SHARED_LIBRARY') and
include the book @('centaur/ipasir/ipasir-backend') in order to allow its
use.</p>

  :parents (fgl)
  :short "How to ensure that FGL can reduce your conjecture to a Boolean formula"
  :long " <p>FGL is intended to reduce ACL2 conjectures to Boolean formulas
that can be solved with a SAT solver.  The first step in this process is to
reduce the variables of the theorem -- which could represent any object at all
-- into a bit-blasted representation of some sort.  In GL, this was typically
done by providing a shape specifier for each variable, and providing a coverage
proof to show that the shape specifier was sufficient to cover all the values
of the variable that satisfy the hypotheses of the theorem.  In FGL, shape
specifiers are not supported (yet); instead, theorem variables are just
variables, but rewrite rules can be used to extract a Boolean representation
from them.</p>

<h3>Generating Boolean variables</h3>

<p>When the FGL interpreter process an IF term, it interprets the test of the
IF, resulting in a symbolic object.  If that symbolic object is a function call
or variable object, then we check the Boolean variable database of the
interpreter state to see whether that object has already been bound to a
Boolean variable.  If not, we add a new Boolean variable representing that
object's truth value.  This is the only way that Boolean variables are
generated in FGL.  An example of how this can be used can be seen in the
following rule (from \"fgl/bitops.lisp\") for expanding the @('loghead') of
some object:</p>

@({
 (def-fgl-rewrite loghead-const-width
   (implies (syntaxp (integerp n))
            (equal (loghead n x)
                   (if (or (zp n)
                           (and (check-int-endp x (syntax-bind xsyn (g-concrete x)))
                                (not (intcar x))))
                       0
                     (intcons (and (intcar x) t)
                              (loghead (1- n) (intcdr x)))))))
 })

<p>Applying this rule to @('(loghead 3 z)') results in three new Boolean
variables being generated due to the subterm @('(and (intcar x) t)'), which is
really @('(if (intcar x) t nil)').  The full expression reduces to a
@('g-integer') form whose bits are the variables generated from @('(intcar
z)'), @('(intcar (intcdr z))'), and @('(intcar (intcdr (intcdr z)))').</p>

<p>So one way of getting from free variables to Boolean formulas that FGL can
use is to access them through functions like @('loghead'), and to have rules
like @('loghead-const-width') that rewrite those in a way that expose the
Boolean variables that we want to reason about.</p>

<h3>Normalizing Variables to Bit-blasted Objects</h3>

<p>Often instead of accessing a variable only through accessors like
@('loghead'), we'll have a hyp that describes the type of the variable.  We can
use such hyps to reduce the variables to bit-blasted objects.  For example, we
have the following rule in \"fgl/bitops.lisp\":</p>
@({
 (def-fgl-rewrite unsigned-byte-p-const-width
   (implies (syntaxp (integerp n))
            (equal (unsigned-byte-p n x)
                   (and (natp n)
                        (equal x (loghead n x))
                        t))))
 })

<p>When we assume @('(unsigned-byte-p 3 z)'), we end up with the formula
@('(equal z (loghead 3 z))'), but @('(loghead 3 z)') gets rewritten to a
symbolic integer as described above.  Since this @('equal') term is in an IF
test @('(and (equal z ...) t)'), we add a Boolean variable for it.  When we add
a Boolean variable for an @('equal') term, we also can add an entry in a
database that maps terms to Boolean variables that equate them to other terms.
Whenever the FGL interpreter produces a symbolic object that has an entry in
this database, we check whether any of those Boolean variables are currently
assumed to be true, and replace that symbolic object with the object it is
equated to.  In this case, we create an entry for @('z') in the database
mapping it to the Boolean variable representing the @('equal') term.  Since
this occurred as a hypothesis in the theorem, we're going to be assuming that
to be true in the conclusion, so whenever we see the variable @('z') there
we'll then replace it with the symbolic integer generated from the
@('loghead').</p>

<h3>Pitfalls and Suggestions</h3>

<p>Make sure the terms that are assigned Boolean variables don't alias each
other -- otherwise proofs may end up having false counterexamples.  For
example, if you generate a Boolean variable for both @('(intcar (intcdr x))')
and @('(logbitp 1 x)'), then you're likely to have false counterexamples where
these two variables are assigned opposite values.  Choose a single normal form
and rewrite other accessors to that -- e.g., use a rule like
@('logbitp-const-index') to ensure that @('logbitp') calls are normalized
correctly to @('(intcar (intcdr ...))') form.</p>

<p>When taking the approach of normalizing typed variables to bit-blasted
objects, it is important that the variable's correct type be assumed at each
use of the variable.  That is, the assumption should be in a top-level
hypothesis or else an @('if') test guarding each use of the variable (aside
from the type assumption itself).  For example, the following probably
works (depending what rules are installed):</p>
 @({
 (fgl-thm
  (if (and (unsigned-byte-p 3 x) (unsigned-byte-p 3 y))
      (equal (+ x y) (+ y x))
     t))
 })
<p>But the following probably doesn't, or at least not by bitblasting:</p>
@({
 (fgl-thm
  (if (not (equal (+ x y) (+ y x)))
      (not (and (unsigned-byte-p 3 x) (unsigned-byte-p 3 y)))
     t))
 })

(defxdoc fgl-correctness-of-binding-free-variables
  :parents (fgl)
  :short "Discussion of the logical justification for the @(see bind-var) feature."
  :long "<p>FGL's @(see bind-var) feature can be used to bind a free variable
in a rewrite rule to some arbitrary value.  Here we discuss how the correctness
of that feature may be formalized.  Note we discuss this with respect to
@('bind-var'), but it applies to binder functions generally.</p>

<h3>Requirements and Basic Idea</h3>

<p>First we describe the requirements for using the @('bind-var') feature.  We
must first have a rewrite rule containing a call of bind-var in either the RHS
or a hyp.  Then, if and when symbolic execution reaches the call of bind-var,
it must be the case that the first argument of @('bind-var') is a variable that
is not yet bound in the current frame (this is checked in the interpreter).  If
this is the case, the interpreter may add a binding for that variable to any
object; in particular, it interprets the second argument of @('bind-var') under
the trivial equivalence @(see unequiv) (meaning that the value returned is
not important for soundness) and binds it to that value.</p>

<p>The justification for this is essentially that all free variables in a
theorem are universally quantified.  When we apply a rewrite rule, we start
with the free variables of the LHS bound to the unifying substitution.  We are
free to bind any other variables that are mentioned in the theorem to whatever
values we want, because the unifying substitution contains all variables of the
LHS, so extending the unifying substitution to include additional variables
won't change the value of the LHS under that substitution.</p>

<h3>Technical Problem and Solutions</h3>
<p>There is a technical problem with this when these free variables appear
inside lambda bodies.  ACL2 term translation ensures that all lambdas bind all
the free variables of their bodies -- when it translates a lambda that has free
variables in the body, it adds bindings for those variables to themselves.  So
if we have a rewrite rule like this:</p>
@({
 (equal (foo x)
        (let* ((a (bar x))
               (c (bind-var b (baz x a))))
            ...))
 })
<p>then the outside of the RHS looks like this:</p>
@({
 ((lambda (a x b) ...)
  (bar x) x b)
 })

<p>We interpret the arguments of a lambda or function call before the body, and
normally if we encounter an unbound variable during symbolic execution we
produce an error.  Therefore, we would run into an error when we process the
argument @('b') of the lambda call.  To avoid this and get the intended
behavior of binding @('b') when we arrive at its @('bind-var') form, we
preprocess lambdas to remove bindings of variables to themselves, instead
carrying forward the existing bindings from the outer context into the lambda
body. (See ACL2 community book \"centaur/meta/bindinglist.lisp\" for the
implementation.)</p>

<p>A further complication is that when we bind a free variable due to
@('bind-var'), it must be bound in the context of the current rewrite rule
application, not just the current lambda body.  To do otherwise would allow
that variable to be bound to different objects in a single application of the
rule.  To deal with this, we effectively have two levels of variable bindings
at any time: the <em>major frame</em> produced by the current rewrite rule
application, which has a wholly new namespace for variables, and a <em>minor
frame</em>produced by each nesting of lambdas, which carries forward all
variable bindings from the previous minor frame and may shadow variable
bindings from the major frame.  When we add a variable binding with
@('bind-var'), that binding goes into the bindings of the major frame.</p>

<h3>Statement of Correctness</h3>

<p>Finally we discuss how the @('bind-var') feature affects how we state the
correctness of the FGL symbolic interpreter.</p>

<p>The correctness of a typical rewriter that takes an alist of variable
bindings is along the lines of:</p>

@({
 (equivalent-under-relation equiv-relation-context
                            (eval-term input-term (eval-bindings bindings env))
                            (eval-term result-term env))
 })

<p>Here equiv-relation-context, input-term, and bindings are inputs to the
rewriter, which produces result-term.</p>

<p>The exact such correctness statement for FGL involves various complications
that we won't discuss here, such as the distinction between input ACL2 terms
and output symbolic objects and various invariants of the interpreter state.
The main complication that we will discuss is that, rather than just an input
to the rewriter as would be the case in a typical rewriter, the relevant
bindings are changed (extended) by the rewriter as it (potentially) adds
variable bindings to the major frame due to @('bind-var').  So the statement we
want (again, very approximately) is:</p>

@({
 (equivalent-under-relation
   equiv-relation-context
   (eval-term input-term (append (eval-bindings output-minor-bindings env)
                                 (eval-bindings output-major-bindings env)))
   (eval-term result-term env))
 })

<p>(To simplify this slightly, we do show that the evaluation of the output and
input minor bindings is equivalent.)</p>

<p>This is reasonable and true, but it isn't sufficiently strong to be
inductively proved.  The problem is that if we successively rewrite two terms,
the output major bindings from the second term may be different from those from
the first, so the inductive assumption from the first term doesn't help us
anymore.</p>

<p>To fix this, we instead prove, approximately:</p>

@({
 (forall ext
         (implies (eval-alist-extension-p
                    ext
                    (append (eval-bindings output-minor-bindings env)
                            (eval-bindings output-major-bindings env)))
                  (equivalent-under-relation equiv-relation-context
                                             (eval-term input-term ext)
                                             (eval-term result-term env))))
 })

<p>Where @('(eval-alist-extension-p a b)') holds when @('a') binds all keys
present in @('b') to the same values.  Since the rewriter only adds pairs to
the major bindings whose keys are not yet bound in either the major or minor
bindings, the resulting appended, evaluated minor and major bindings is such an
extension of the input appended, evaluated major and minor bindings.  This
allows the inductive assumption about the first term to be applied to the
bindings resulting from rewriting the second term.</p>")

  :short "Outline of the way the FGL interpreter works."

"

<p>The FGL interpreter is called by the FGL clause processor in order to try
and turn the theorem term into an equivalent Boolean formula, which then can
perhaps be solved by SAT.  In order to do this, it recursively interprets terms
turning them into symbolic objects (see @(see fgl-object)) containing Boolean formula
objects.  In this doc topic we outline the operation of the interpreter.</p>

<p>The interpreter consists of a 31-way mutual recursion.  We won't detail each
of the functions in the mutual recursion, but we will try to cover in general
terms all of the things that happen in them.</p>

<h3>Interpreting Terms -- Overview</h3>

<p>The highest-level entry point into the interpreter when trying to compute a
Boolean formula from a term is @('fgl-interp-test').  This first interprets the
term using another possible high-level entry point, @('fgl-interp-term-equivs'),
which calls @('fgl-interp-term') to produce a symbolic object (we'll cover its
operation shortly), then checks a database of equivalences that have been
assumed in the current path condition and replaces that symbolic object with an
equivalent if there are any that have been assumed (and which some heuristics
say are a good replacement).  Finally, it calls @('fgl-interp-simplify-if-test')
which is the subroutine for coercing a symbolic object into a Boolean
formula.</p>

<p>@('fGl-interp-term') is very similar to a classical interpreter or rewriter.
It examines the term and treats different kinds of terms differently:</p>
<ul>

<li>When it is a constant (quote), it returns the quoted value, coerced to a @(see
g-concrete) symbolic object.</li>

<li>When it is a variable, it looks up the variable in the current
bindings (alist).  There are actually two sets of bindings for our interpreter:
\"minor\" bindings, which come from lambdas, and \"major\" bindings, which come
from outermost contexts not inside any lambdas; these are checked in that
order.</li>

<li>When it is a lambda application, it processes the term into an equivalent
pair @('(bindinglist body)').  The bindinglist is a list of pairs @('(formals
actuals)') from the nest of lambdas, omitting formal/actual pairs that are the
same.  This may include the bindings of more than one lambda: if the body of a
lambda is itself a lambda application, it recursively adds that to the
bindinglist, stopping when it finds a lambda body that is not itself a lambda.
The interpreter interprets the bindinglist by recurring through the list,
recursively interpreting each of the actuals of each pair with
@('fgl-interp-term-equivs').  When a pair is done it adds the bindings formed by
pairing the formals with the symbolic object results from the actuals to the
minor bindings of the interpreter.  When done with all the @('(formals
actuals)') pairs, it then recursively interprets the body, then pops off the
bindings produced by the bindinglist, returning the symbolic object resulting
from interpreting the body.</li>

<li>When it is a function call, it deals with a few special cases, described
next, and then the generic function call case.  In the generic case, it first
recursively interprets the arguments of the function, then calls
@('fgl-interp-fncall'), described below, on the function and symbolic objects
resulting from the arguments.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Interpreting Function Calls -- Special Cases</h3>

<p>The special cases of function calls include @('if'), @('return-last'),
@('bind-var'), @('abort-rewrite'), @('fgl-sat-check'), @('syntax-interp-fn'),
@('assume'), @('narrow-equiv'), and @('fgl-interp-obj'). Each of these requires
special treatment of the arguments, rather than just recursively interpreting
them:</p>

<ul>

<li>For @('if') terms, the test is recursively interpreted and coerced to a
Boolean function using @('fgl-interp-test').  Then, unless a syntactic analysis
shows that the path condition implies the test's negation, we recursively
interpret the \"then\" branch with @('fgl-interp-term-equivs') and with the test
conjoined to the path condition, and unless the syntactic analysis shows the
path condition implies the test, we recursively interpret the \"else\" branch
with the negated test conjoined to the path condition.  If both branches were
interpreted, we then attempt to merge the results from the two branches into a
single symbolic object using @('fgl-interp-merge-branches'), described
below.</li>

<li>For @('return-last'), we provide special support for @('time$'), allowing
it to time the symbolic interpretation of the enclosed term.  Otherwise, we
simply interpret the last argument.  Note this means that @('prog2$') might not
function as expected -- if you intend the first argument to @('prog2$') to be
interpreted in FGL for side effects, you should instead bind it to an ignored
variable or else use an equivalent two-argument function instead.</li>

<li>For @('bind-var'), we bind the first argument, which must be a variable
that is not yet bound in the current major or minor frame, to the result of
interpreting the second argument under the @('unequiv') equivalence relation.
Under this equivalence relation, every object is equivalent to every other
object; this is sort of an \"anything goes\" mode which allows certain behavior
that would normally be unsound.  This is allowable in this context because
@('bind-var') logically just returns its first argument (the variable), so the
second argument is irrelevant.  It is allowable to bind anything to the
variable if it is not yet bound **** </li>

<li>For @('binder'), the argument must be a function call whose first argument
is a variable, and that variable must be free in the current stack frame.  The
rest of that function's arguments are recursively interpreted, and then binder
rewrite/meta rules are applied to choose a binding for the free variable based
on the rest of the arguments.</li>

<li>For @('abort-rewrite'), the interpreter returns @('nil') and inserts a
special error keyword in the interpreter state's @('errmsg') field, which will
get caught when returning from the current major stack frame.</li>

<li>For @('fgl-sat-check'), we use @('fgl-interp-test') to coerce the second
argument (the condition to be tested) to a Boolean function, and
@('fgl-interp-term-equivs') to interpret the first argument (params).  We then
call @('interp-st-sat-check'), an attachable function which calls SAT and
returns NIL if the input Boolean formula is unsat.</li>

<li>For @('syntax-interp-fn'), we check that the second argument is a quoted
term (this is true for calls generated by the @('syntax-interp') and
@('syntax-bind') macros) and that we're in an @('unequiv') equivalence
context.  If so, we evaluate the first argument using @('fancy-ev'), with the
current variable bindings from the symbolic interpreter passed in as the
evaluation environment.  For example, if a variable @('x') is bound to a
symbolic integer in our current interpreter frame, then @('x') will be bound to
the @(see fgl-object) representation of that symbolic integer when evaluating
the @('syntax-interp') term.  This is similar to ACL2's @(see syntaxp)
behavior, but the syntaxp term operates on FGL object syntax rather than ACL2
term syntax.</li>

<li>For @('assume'), we first check that we're in an @('unequiv') equivalence
context.  Then we interpret the first and second arguments as if they were the
@('test') and @('then') branches of an @('if'); in particular, the Boolean
formula resulting from the @('test') is conjoined onto the path condition (that
is, assumed) when symbolically executing the @('then') branch.  We then simply
return the result from the @('then') branch.</li>

<li>For @('narrow-equiv'), we interpret the first argument.  If its result is a
concrete object whose value satisfies @('equiv-contexts-p') and those
equivalence contexts are a refinement (narrowing) of the interpreter state's
current equiv-contexts, then we set the interpreter state's equiv-contexts
field to that object while interpreting the second argument.  This can be used
to (conditionally) exit an @('unequiv') context.</li>

<li>For @('fgl-time-fn'), we interpret the first argument and use that as a
@('time$') format specifier for timing the interpretation of the second
argument, returning the result from the second argument.</li>

<li>For @('fgl-prog2'), we interpret the first argument under the
@('unequiv') equivalence context, discarding the result; then interpret the
second argument under the current equivalence context and return its result.</li>

<li>For @('fgl-interp-obj'), we first check that we're in an @('unequiv')
equivalence context.  Then we interpret the first argument.  If its result is a
concrete object whose value satisfies @('pseudo-term-p'), then we interpret
that term and return its result.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Interpreting Function Calls -- Generic Case</h3>

<p>Generic function calls are run by @('fgl-interp-fncall') after reducing the
arguments to a list of symbolic objects.  This looks up the <see topic='@(url
fgl-function-mode)'>function mode</see> of the function and, depending on the
restrictions encoded in that mode, may do some or all of the following:</p>

<ul>

<li>If all the arguments are explicit, i.e. symbolic objects of the @(see
g-concrete) kind, then try to execute the function using @(see
magic-ev-fncall).  If it runs successfuly, return the result as a
@('g-concrete') object.</li>

<li>Otherwise try applying each of the rules enabled for that function in the
@('fgl-rewrite-rules') table using @('fgl-rewrite-try-rule').  These may be
rewrite, meta, or primitive rules. If any of those rules succeeds, return the
symbolic object produced by recursively interpreting the RHS of the rule under
the unifying substitution.</li>

<li>Otherwise try executing a primitive associated with that function; see
@(see fgl-primitive-and-meta-rules).  If successful, return the value from that primitive.</li>

<li>Otherwise, if there exists a rule with rune @('(:definition fnname)'), or
if there are rewrite/definition rules for that function listed in the
@('fgl-definition-rules') table, then try rewriting the call using those
rules.</li>

<li>Finally, if none of the above were successful, produce the object
@('(g-apply fnname args)').</li>

</ul>

<p>This completes the overview of how a term is interpreted and turned into
either a symbolic object (@(see fgl-object)) or Boolean formula.  Next we
describe three subroutines that we skipped describing above:
@('fgl-rewrite-try-rule'), which attempts to apply a rewrite rule;
@('fgl-interp-simplify-if-test'), which coerces a symbolic object into a Boolean
formula; and @('fgl-interp-merge-branches'), which merges two branches of an IF
test.  This will also lead us to discuss @('fgl-interp-add-constraints'), which
adds Boolean constraints according to a set of rules activated when introducing
a new Boolean variable representing some term.</p>

<h3>Applying Rewrite Rules</h3>

<p>@('fgl-rewrite-try-rule') takes a rule, a function name, and a list of
arguments which are FGL symbolic objects.  The rule may be a rewrite, meta, or
primitive rule.  For a primitive rule, the primitive function indicated by the
rule is run on the function and arguments, and we return the object it produces
if successful.  For a meta rule, the metafunction indicated is run, and if
successful we recursively interpret the term returned under the bindings
returned.  For a rewrite rule, we first try to unify the LHS of the rule with
the input function/arguments.  If successful, we then try to relieve the hyps
of the rule by calling @('fgl-interp-test') on each one and checking that the
result is (syntactically) constant-true.  We also check @('syntaxp') and
@('bind-free') hyps, the latter of which might extend the unifying substitution
with some free variable bindings.</p>

<p>If the hypotheses are all relieved, then we recurs on the conclusion using
@('fgl-interp-term') and return the result unless there were errors recorded in
the interpreter state.  Errors are passed up to the caller except for the
special error produced by @('abort-rewrite'), which only causes the current
rule application to fail.</p>

<p>During this process, various helper functions are also called to support
tracing (see @(see fgl-rewrite-tracing)) and accumulated-persistence-style
profiling, but none of these are logically relevant.</p>

<p>Application of binder rules is similar, but with slightly different logical
contracts for the rules and very slightly different behavior.  For binder
rules, we unify the argument list with the argument list of the LHS of the
rule, omitting the initial argument of the LHS which must be the variable to be
bound.  Binder rules also specify the equivalence context under which the RHS
must be rewritten.</p>


<h3>Simplifying IF Tests</h3>

<p>@('fgl-interp-simplify-if-test') takes a symbolic object and attempts to
reduce it to an IFF-equivalent Boolean formula.  For some varieties of symbolic
object, this is trivial: @(':g-concrete') objects' truth value is just the
truth value of the quoted value, @('g-integer') and @('g-cons') objects are
always nonnil, @('g-map') objects are nonnil unless their alist field is
exactly NIL, and @('g-boolean') objects' truth values are given by their
Boolean formulas.  This leaves @('g-var'), @('g-ite'), and @('g-apply') objects.</p>

<p>For @('g-ite') objects, we coerce the @('test') sub-object into a Boolean
formula using @('fgl-interp-simplify-if-test') recursively.  Then, similar to
symbolic interpretation of IF, we recur on the @('then') object unless the test
formula is syntactically falsified by the path condition, we recur on the
@('else') branch unless the test formula is syntactically true under the path
condition, and we then merge the branches by creating the if-then-else of the
Boolean formulas if both branches were run.</p>

<p>For @('g-var') objects, we assign a fresh Boolean variable to the object,
storing the association in the Boolean variable database (@('bvar-db')) of the
interpreter state, unless the object already has an associated Boolean
variable, in which case we return it.</p>

<p>For @('g-apply') objects, we first rewrite the function call under an IFF
context.  In many cases this is redundant, but in some cases it may produce
reductions.  If rewriting is successful, we recursively apply
@('fgl-simplify-if-test') to the result.  Otherwise, we look up the function
call object in the @('bvar-db') and return the associated Boolean variable, if
any, or else introduce a fresh one and record that association.  Finally, if a
new Boolean variable was introduced, we process the object with
@('fgl-interp-add-constraints') (see below) to record any constraints on the new
Boolean variable.</p>

<h3>Merging IF Branches</h3>

<p>@('fgl-interp-merge-branches') takes a Boolean formula for an IF test and
symbolic objects for the then and else branch values, and returns a new
symbolic object encapsulating the if-then-else.</p>

<p>It first checks for trivial cases -- test constant true, test constant false,
or branches equal -- and returns the obvious results in those cases.
Otherwise, if either branch is a function call (@(see g-apply)) object, then it
tries applying branch merge rules for those functions using
@('fgl-rewrite-try-rule') applied to the IF.  If any of these are successful, it
returns the result.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if both branches are calls of the same function, it recursively
merges the argument lists and returns the function applied to the merged
arguments.  Otherwise, it calls helper function
@('interp-st-fgl-object-basic-merge'), which merges basic symbolic objects
together when their types match, otherwise either producing an
if-then-else (@(see g-ite)) object or an error, depending on the configuration
setting of @('make-ites').  (See also @(see fgl-handling-if-then-elses).)</p>

  :short "Proving SAT instances in FGL"
  :long "

<p>Calls of SAT in FGL are controlled by configuration objects of the type
@(see fgl-sat-config).  (An exception is when the default attachment of the
stub function @('interp-st-sat-check') is changed by the user; this topic
pertains to the usual situation where its attachment is
@('fgl-default-sat-check-impl').)</p>

<p>When FGL calls SAT automatically on the result of symbolically executing a
theorem, the @(see fgl-sat-config) object that is used is the result of calling
the attachable stub function @('fgl-toplevel-sat-check-config'). The default
attachment produces a config object that calls an external SAT solver through
SATLINK, and delegates the configuration of SATLINK to another attachable
function, @('fgl-satlink-config').  So the easiest way to change the SAT solver
used by FGL is to change this attachment as follows (see @(see satlink::config)):</p>

@({
 (define my-fgl-satlink-config ()
   :returns (config satlink::config-p)
   (satlink::change-config satlink::*default-config* :cmdline \"kissat \"))

 (defattach fgl::fgl-satlink-config my-fgl-satlink-config)
 })

<p>When FGL rewrite rules or top-level theorems call
SAT using @(see fgl-sat-check), the configuration object is provided as an
argument to that function.  FGL also checks vacuity of hypotheses by default,
and the default configuration for this uses another attachable stub function
@('fgl-toplevel-vacuity-check-config').</p>

<p>An @(see fgl-sat-config) object is either an @(see
fgl-satlink-monolithic-sat-config), an @(see fgl-ipasir-config), or an @(see fgl-exhaustive-test-config)
 object.  When
it is a @(see fgl-satlink-monolithic-sat-config), satisfiability is checked by
perhaps performing some
<see topic='@(url aignet::aignet-comb-transforms)'>AIG transformations</see>
and subsequently calling a
<see topic='@(url satlink::satlink)'>SATLINK</see>
monolithic solver.
When it is an @(see fgl-ipasir-config), satisfiability is
checked by calling an 
<see topic='@(url ipasir::ipasir)'>IPASIR</see>
incremental SAT shared library, which may allow the
current check to benefit from learned lemmas and heuristic information from
previous checks.  Finally, when it is an @(see fgl-exhaustive-test-config),
satisfiability is checked by exhaustive testing of the AIG using <see
topic='@(url aignet::vector-simulation)'>vector simulation</see>, perhaps after
some AIG transformations.  This requires that the AIG have 37 or fewer inputs,
corresponding to the number of entries in FGL's Boolean variable database (see
@(see fgl-getting-bits-from-objects).  However, if the @('random-iters') field
of the config object is set, then this input constraint is removed, randomized
testing is used instead of exhaustive testing, and the check can never return
UNSAT.</p>

<p>All three such config object types are simple tagged products, and they have
two fields in common:</p>
<ul>
<li>@('ignore-pathcond') says to ignore the path condition when checking satisfiability</li>
<li>@('ignore-constraint') says to ignore the constraint condition (see @(see def-fgl-boolean-constraint) when checking satisfiability.</li>
</ul>

<p>The other fields of the @(see fgl-satlink-monolithic-sat-config) object are
as follows.  The @('transform') and @('transform-config-override') fields also
pertain to @('fgl-exhaustive-test-config') objects:</p>

<ul>

<li>@('satlink-config-override') may either be a @(see satlink::config) object
or nil.  If set, this object determines how to call SAT, e.g., what
command-line solver to use.  If not, the SATLINK configuration object used is
the attachment of the stub function @('fgl-satlink-config').</li>

<li>@('transform') is a Boolean value; if @('T'), then AIGNET transforms are
used to simplify the problem before calling the solver.</li>

<li>@('transform-config-override') is a list of AIGNET transform configuration
objects; see @(see aignet::aignet-comb-transforms).  If empty, the attachment
of the stub function @('fgl-aignet-transforms-config') is used as the list of
transforms.</li>

</ul>


<p>The other fields of the @(see fgl-ipasir-config) object are:</p>

<ul>

<li>@('ipasir-callback-limit') may be nil or a natural number.  If a number, it
provides a work limit for the incremental SAT checker, the precise meaning of
which depends on the solver but is generally a conflict or restart count.</li>

<li>@('ipasir-recycle-callback-limit') may be nil or a natural number.  If a
number, it causes the solver object to be destroyed and recreated after the
given number of callbacks, which may be important for performance.</li>

<li>@('ipasir-index') is a natural number, default 0.  This determines which
solver object is used.  If a new ipasir index is used, then a new solver object
is created and initialized, and every subsequent use of that ipasir index
refers to that solver object (until perhaps the recycle-callback-limit causes
it to be reinitialized).</li>

(defxdoc binder-functions
  :parents (fgl-rewrite-rules)
  :short "Functions that describe constraints on bindings for free variables."
  :long "<p>A binder function doesn't have a particular form (other than having at least
one argument), but it is one intended to be used with FGL free variable binding
constructs such as @(see binder-rules).</p>

<p>A binder function essentially places some logical restrictions on what may
be bound to a particular free variable, so that these restrictions may be used
in proving the theorem where the binder function. After the theorem is proved,
when it is used in rewriting, @(see binder-rules) can be used to provide
bindings for the variables such that the restrictions are satisfied.</p>

<p>The most trivial example is @(see bind-var), which is defined to simply
return its first argument:</p>
@({
 (define bind-var (ans form)
   ans)
 })

<p>Because bind-var returns its first argument unchanged no matter what, this
places no restrictions on what it returns: it can be made to return any object,
just by setting its first argument to that object. Therefore we can create any
binder rule we like. E.g., the following rule says that if the second argument
to the bind-var form is @('(foo x)'), its free variable argument should be
bound to @('(+ 1 x)'):</p>
@({
 (fgl::def-fgl-brewrite bind-var-of-foo
   (implies (equal free-var (+ 1 x))
            (equal (bind-var free-var (foo x))
                   free-var)))
 })

<p>When interpreted as a <see topic='@(url binder-rules)'>binder rule</see>, this
has no hypotheses (so it can apply whenever bind-var is called on a free
variable and an argument that unifies with @('(foo x)')), and it rewrites to
@('(+ 1 x)'), meaning when it is applied, that free variable will be bound to
the object resulting from rewriting @('(+ 1 x)') and this same object will be
returned from the @('bind-var') form.</p>

<p>A slightly less simple example: @('check-equal') is a binder function that
is Boolean-valued and may only return T if its second and third arguments are equal:</p>
@({
 (define check-equal (ans x y)
   (and (equal x y)
        ans
        t))
 })

<p>FGL has a binder meta rule implementing this, which returns T if the two
objects are syntactically equal. But another way to get a similar effect would
be with this binder rewrite rule:</p>

@({
 (fgl::def-fgl-brewrite check-equal-brewrite
   (implies (and (equal x y)
                 (equal ans t))
            (equal (check-equal ans x y) ans)))
 })
<p>This rule says that if the hypothesis @('(equal x y)') is satisfied, then
the free variable should be bound to @('t') and @('t') returned from the
check-equal call.</p>


<p>A non-trivial example: @('common-suffix-binder') must always return
something that is a common suffix of its second and third arguments, or else
@('nil'):</p>

@({
 (define common-suffix-binder (res list1 list2)
   (and (suffixp res list1)
        (suffixp res list2)
        res))
 })

<p>If this binder is used in a theorem, then when proving that theorem, it is
known that the return value of the common-suffix-binder call is either a suffix
of both lists or NIL.</p>

<p>When applying a rewrite rule that contains a call of common-suffix-binder
whose first argument is a free variable, FGL needs to find an object that
satisfies that condition; if it can do so, it will bind that object to the free
variable and return it from the call of common-suffix-binder. There might be
several strategies that could find an object that would satisfy the needed
conditions. Here is one example: this pair of binder rewrite rules finds such a suffix
for two CONS nest terms if they are the same length and have a syntactically
equal common suffix:</p>

@({
 (fgl::def-fgl-brewrite find-common-suffix-when-equal
   (implies (and (equal list1 list2)
                 (equal res list1))
            (equal (common-suffix-binder res list1 list2) res)))

 (fgl::def-fgl-brewrite find-common-suffix-when-not-equal
   (implies (and (not (and (check-equal car-eq a1 a2)
                           (check-equal cdr-eq d1 d2)))
                 (equal res (common-suffix-binder res2 d1 d2)))
            (equal (common-suffix-binder res (cons a1 d1) (cons a2 d2)) res)))
 })

<p>The first rule says that if the two lists are provably equal, then the first
list should be bound to the free variable and returned from the
common-suffix-binder form. The second rule applies when the two terms are both
CONS calls, and their arguments are pairwise <em>not</em> provably equal (so
that the first rule can apply in the case where they are). In this case, it
says to continue the search by looking for a common suffix of the two cdr
arguments d1 and d2.</p>

(defxdoc fgl-rewrite-rules
  :parents (fgl)
  :short "Differences between FGL and ACL2 rewrite rules"
  :long "<p>FGL rewrite rules are essentially just ACL2 rewrite rules.  More
specifically, they are derived from formulas that have basically the same form
as ACL2 rewrite rules; they need not be stored with
@(':rule-classes :rewrite').  FGL uses a different set of rules than the ones
that are enabled for use in ACL2, because not all good ACL2 rewrite rules are
good FGL rewrite rules, and
vice versa.  A particularly important difference is that @(see syntaxp) and
@(see bind-free) forms receive <see topic='@(url fgl-object)'>FGL symbolic
objects</see> as their inputs, rather than ACL2 terms.  FGL rewrite rules also
allow special constructs @(see bind-var), @(see binder), and @(see syntax-bind)
which allow free variables to be bound as with @(see bind-free), but in the RHS
of the rewrite rule rather than in the hyps.  They additionally support a form
@(see abort-rewrite) which causes the application of the rule to be aborted
when encountered in the RHS, similarly to if a hypothesis was not relieved.</p>

<h3>Creating and Removing FGL Rewrite Rules</h3>
<p>An FGL rewrite rule is an ACL2 rewrite rule.  You can register an existing
ACL2 theorem for use as an FGL rewrite rule using:</p>
@({
 (fgl::add-fgl-rewrite my-rule)
 })
<p>And you can disable that rule for use by FGL using:</p>
@({
 (fgl::remove-fgl-rewrite my-rule)
 })
<p>To create a new rewrite rule and enable it for FGL, you may use:</p>
@({
 (fgl::def-fgl-rewrite my-rule
    body
   :hints ...)
 })
<p>This just expands to:</p>
@({
 (defthmd my-rule ...)
 (fgl::add-fgl-rewrite my-rule)
 })

<p>FGL also supports rewrite rules that are triggered not on the leading
function symbol of the LHS, but on the leading function symbol of an
if-then-else branch.  These rules can be added using
@('(fgl::add-fgl-branch-merge my-rule)') and they can be created using:</p>
@({
 (fgl::def-fgl-branch-merge my-rule
    body
    ...)
 })

<p>A suitable branch merge rule has a left-hand side of the form @('(if test
then else)') where @('then') is a function call.  Generally, @('test') and
@('else') should be free variables, but this isn't a hard and fast rule.</p>

<h3>Binding Free Variables</h3>

<p>There are several ways in which variables not present in the LHS of the rule
can become bound:</p>

<ul>

<li>Bind-free hypotheses: similar to ACL2's @(see bind-free), but sees existing
variables' values as FGL objects and must bind new variables to FGL
objects (see @(see fgl-object)), rather than ACL2 terms.</li>

<li>Binder functions: see @(see bind-var), @(see binder), and @(see
syntax-bind).  Binder functions can also determine the values to be assigned to
the free variables using rewriting; see @(see binder-rules).</li>

<li>Equivalence-based binding hypotheses: a hypothesis of the form @('(equiv
free-var form)') where equiv is a known equivalence relation and free-var is a
variable not bound in the current rewriting context. This will result in FGL
rewriting @('form') under equivalence relation @('equiv') and binding the
result to @('free-var').</li>

<li>Match-assums hypotheses: A hypothesis of the form @('(fgl::match-assums
hyp)') will look for an assumption in the current path condition that matches
the form of @('hyp') and binds any free variables in @('hyp') accordingly. In
more detail, for each Boolean variable in the interpreter's Boolean variable
database whose associated object's leading function symbol is the same as that
of @('hyp'), we check whether that object unifies with @('hyp') under the
existing variable bindings, and if so whether that variable is currently
assumed in the path condition. If so, we add the unifying subsitution to the
current variable bindings.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Advanced Features</h3>

<p>Two additional features support a new style of programming rewrite rules.
@('Bind-var') and @('syntax-bind') allow functionality similar to bind-free,
but available within the right-hand side of a rewrite rule.  @('Abort-rewrite')
allows the rewrite operation to be cancelled partway through interpreting the
right-hand side.</p>

<p>Here is an example that uses both syntax-bind and abort-rewrite, from
\"bitops.lisp\":</p>

@({
  (def-fgl-rewrite logtail-to-logtail-helper
    (implies (syntaxp (not (fgl-object-case n :g-concrete)))
             (equal (logtail n x)
                    (b* ((x (int x))
                         (n (nfix (int n)))
                         ((when (syntax-bind n-concrete (fgl-object-case n :g-concrete)))
                          (logtail n x))
                         (n-width (integer-length-bound n-width n))
                         ((unless n-width)
                          (abort-rewrite (logtail n x)))
                         (n-rev (int-revapp n-width n 0)))
                      (logtail-helper n-rev n-width x))))

 })

<p>When attempting to apply this rewrite rule, the FGL rewriter starts in much
the same way as the ACL2 rewriter.  As a precondition for attempting to apply
this rule, the term we are rewriting must be a call of logtail, and that call
must unify with the LHS of this rule -- in this case any call of logtail will
do so.</p>

<p>Next, we relieve the hyps.  This rule only has one hyp, which is a
syntaxp call; we check that @('n') is not a @(':g-concrete') object.</p>

<p>Then we proceed by interpreting the RHS.  We bind @('x') to the result of
rewriting @('(int x)') (where @('int') is an alias for @('ifix') and rebind
@('n') to the result of rewriting @('(nfix (int n))'), and then we encounter
our first syntax-bind form.  The syntax-bind form has the free variable
@('n-concrete'), which is here to logically represent the result we get from
evaluating the syntax-bind form.  A syntax-bind form is logically equivalent to
its first argument, so when we prove @('logtail-to-logtail-helper') correct we
prove it with the free variable @('n-concrete') in place of the syntax-bind.
That means we are logically justified in returning anything we want from the
syntax-bind form -- since n-concrete is a free variable not previously bound,
the rule is applicable for any value of n-concrete.  In this case we evaluate
@('(fgl-object-case n :g-concrete)').  (Note: @('syntax-bind') is a macro that
uses the primitive forms @(see bind-var) and @(see syntax-interp) to implement
this behavior; see their documentation for more general usage.)  This will
produce a Boolean value, which is a concrete FGL object representing itself.  If
true, then n is concrete and we will produce the result of again rewriting
@('(logtail n x)') -- note that we haven't created a loop here because the
syntaxp hyp required that the original @('n') was not concrete. Otherwise, we
proceed with the next form.</p>

<p>The next form appears to bind @('(integer-length-bound n-width n)') to
@('n-width'), which may appear mysterious since @('n-width') is used in its own
binding. This is because @('integer-length-bound') is a
<see topic='@(url binder-functions)'>binder-function</see>
intended to bind its first argument (which must be a free variable) to some
value determined by the rest of its arguments. So here @('n-width') is a free
variable that will be bound to some value determined by examining @('n'); the
definition of @('integer-length-bound') guarantees that that value is either a
bound on the integer-length of @('n') or is NIL. In fact, the value to be bound
is derived in this case by a meta rule @('integer-length-bound-binder'). In
other cases it could be determined by a rewrite rule; see @(see binder-rules).</p>

<p>We then require that @('n-width') is nonnil, meaning we have found a good
bound for the integer-length of @('n'). If not, we have an @('abort-rewrite')
form which causes the current rewrite rule attempt to end, ignoring the form
inside the abort-rewrite.  (In this case the form @('(logtail n x)') inside the
abort-rewrite was selected to make it easy to prove
@('logtail-to-logtail-helper') correct.)  Otherwise, we go on with our
rewrite.</p>

<p>Last, we finish this rewrite: the point of this rule was to replace a call
of @('logtail') with a @('logtail-helper') form which can be opened iteratively
to create the symbolic value needed.</p>

<h3>Examining the Interpreter State</h3>

<p>FGL's implementation of syntaxp, bind-free, and syntax-bind interpret the
syntactic term using a custom evaluator, @(see fancy-ev), that can be
instrumented to call functions that examine the ACL2 state and the FGL
interpreter state, and even make limited modifications to them.  See the
documentation for @(see fancy-ev) for how to use it, and see @(see
fgl-interpreter-state) for documentation of the contents of the interpreter state. One
main use of this is to examine counterexamples produced from incremental SAT
calls.  By default, after loading @('fgl/top'), the rewrite rule
@('show-counterexample-rw') rewrites the constant-nil function
@('(show-counterexample msg)') such that a syntax-bind form fetches the latest
incremental SAT counterexample and prints it.</p>

  :parents (fgl)
  :short "Discussion of how if-then-else objects are dealt with in FGL."
  :long "

<h3>Why If-Then-Elses Are A Problem</h3>
<p>One of the most powerful and advantageous things about FGL is that it can
avoid case splits in proofs by encoding the case splits into Boolean functions
that are later handled by fast solvers.  For example, if a function might
return either 3 or 5, then instead of considering the two cases separately we
can encode both cases into a symbolic integer value.  But for some case splits
the cases aren't so easily merged into a single symbolic value, except by
directly encoding the case split.  For example, if we have @('((a . b) . c)')
in one case but @('(d . (e . f))') in the other case, it isn't clear how best
to represent that.</p>

<p>Such cases can cause dilemmas and problems for FGL's symbolic
interpretation.  For example, suppose we have the following rewrite rules:</p>
@({
 (foo (bar x) y) = (baz x y)
 (foo (zar x) y) = (fuz x y)
 })

<p>But suppose that when we encounter a call of @('foo'), we have @('(if c (bar
3) (zar 5))') as the first argument.  What do we do?  We could always split
into cases for all the IFs in all the arguments of a function we're processing,
but this could easily get stuck in exponential case splits.  But otherwise, we
might miss rewrites that the user might expect to happen.  The user could fix
this case by adding the following rewrite rule:</p>
@({
 (foo (if c a b) y) = (if c (foo a y) (foo b y))
 })
<p>But this means the user needs to know all of the places this might happen
and make a rewrite rule for each of them, and by that time it might be just as
catastrophic for performance.</p>

<h3>Disallowing If-Then-Elses</h3>

<p>Because of the dilemma above, the default approach in FGL is to cause an
error whenever we are unable to merge the two branches of an if-then-else into
a single symbolic form automatically.  When this happens, the FGL clause processor will
produce an error saying that an if-then-else failed to merge and to look at the
debug object.  This behavior can be disabled as follows:</p>
@({
 (assign :fgl-make-ites t)
 })

<p>It is also possible to use rewrite rules to allow if-then-else objects to be
created in certain cases; we discuss how this is used to handle a couple of
common cases in the next section.  The FGL interpreter includes support for
making @('ifs') transparent to certain functions, so that rewrite rules for
that purpose needn't proliferate.  But often the best option is to encode data
so that you don't need to represent it using if-then-elses; some examples of
how to do that follow.</p>

<h3>Merge Rules</h3>

<p>FGL uses a function @('gl-object-basic-merge') to merge certain combinations
of objects: it can merge two symbolic or concrete integers into a symbolic
integer, or merge two symbolic or concrete Boolean values into a symbolic
Boolean.  It also comes with some merging rules that allow a couple of common
idioms: the use of @('nil') as a \"bottom\" element for various types, and the
use of symbols as enum types.</p>

<p>To force the creation of an if-then-else, overriding the setting of
@(':fgl-make-ites'), use the function @('if!') instead of @('if') in the
right-hand side.  For example, one of the rules that allows the use of @('nil')
as bottom follows:</p>

@({
 (def-gl-branch-merge if-with-if-with-nil-nil
   (equal (if test (if test2 then nil) nil)
          (if! (and test test2) then nil)))
 })

<p>This will ensure that a @(':g-ite') object will be created without checking
whether @('then') can be merged with @('nil') (presumably this was already
tried since @('(if test2 then nil)') was matched in the left-hand side.</p>

<h3>Making Functions Transparent to If-Then-Elses</h3>

<p>The FGL interpreter can be told to distribute calls of a given function over
if-then-else objects that might appear in their arguments as follows:</p>

@({
 (enable-split-ifs foo)
 })

<p>This is similar to creating a rewrite rule matching an @('if') in each
argument of @('foo') and distributing the call of @('foo') into it, as
follows:</p>

@({
 (def-gl-rewrite foo-of-if-1
    (equal (foo (if test a1 a2) b)
           (if test
               (foo a1 b)
             (foo a2 b))))
 (def-gl-rewrite foo-of-if-2
    (equal (foo a (if test b1 b2))
           (if test
               (foo a b1)
             (foo a b2))))
 })

<p>(Enabling if splitting for a function enables it for all the arguments; if
this isn't desired, then providing rewrite rules like the ones above is a
reasonable alternative.)</p>

<p>Generally speaking, it is likely to be advantageous to enable splitting ifs
on a couple of kinds of functions:</p>

<ul>

<li>Functions that are handled in FGL via rewrite rules wherein their
arguments are other function calls, such as datatype accessors and predicates.</li>

<li>Primitives, especially if they always return an integer or always return a
Boolean, since these then eliminate the if-then-else once their branches are
merged.</li>

</ul>

<p>Conversely, it is likely not advantageous to enable splitting ifs on
functions that are handled by expanding a definition-style rule where the
arguments to the function on the LHS are just variables.</p>


<h3>Encoding Data to Avoid If-Then-Elses</h3>

<p>Here are some general ideas for encoding data so as to avoid if-then-elses.
After that, we provide some examples to give a flavor for how this works.</p>

<ul>

<li>Think about the types of the data you'll be dealing with and how best to
encode them symbolically.</li>

<li>Wrap any if-then-elses inside function definitions and turn off expansion
of those function definitions (see below).</li>

<li>Set up branch merge rules to merge these functions with other data of the
same type.</li>

<li>Set up rewrite rules to deal with accesses to those functions, likely
including checks for equality.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Example 1: Enumeration Type</h4>

<p>(Note: the built-in support for symbols as enum types makes the following
example largely unnecessary, but still illustrative.)</p>

@({
 (defun vector-kind (x)
   (cond ((equal (loghead 2 x) 0) :big)
         ((equal (logtail 2 x) 0) :little)
         (t                       :neither)))

        (:neither (or (logbitp 2 x) (logbitp 3 x))))))
 
 ;; But when we try this we get a merge error -- (@ :fgl-interp-error-debug-obj) shows
 ;; (14 :LITTLE :NEITHER) and (@ :fgl-interp-error-debug-stack) shows we were
 ;; applying the definition of VECTOR-KIND.
 
 ;; Vector-kind produces a symbol that is one of (:big :little :neither) -- an enumeration type.
 ;; We can encode that in a few different ways -- as a number or as a priority-encoding.
 (defun vector-kind-encoding (littlep bigp)
   (cond (littlep :little)
         (bigp :big)
         (t :neither)))

   (equal (vector-kind x)
          (cond ((equal (loghead 2 x) 0) (vector-kind-encoding nil t))
                ((equal (logtail 2 x) 0) (vector-kind-encoding t nil))
                (t                       (vector-kind-encoding nil nil)))))
 
 ;; At minimum we need a rule for checking equality of a vector-kind-encoding.
 ;; Note: EQUAL will unify both ways, so no need to worry about the order of the
 ;; arguments!
 (fgl::def-fgl-rewrite equal-of-vector-kind-encoding
   (equal (equal (vector-kind-encoding littlep bigp) x)

                (bigp    (equal x :big))
                (t       (equal x :neither)))))
 
 ;; Now the fgl-thm above will go through.
 
 ;; Often we might also need a rule for merging if-then-elses where the encoding
 ;; is one branch. But we can only merge if the other branch is also one of the
 ;; symbols in the enumeration, so we need to test for that.

                                         (if test bigp (equal else :big))))))
 
 ;; Alternatively, we could instead turn off expansion of (vector-kind x) and
 ;; write rules directly on that:

 (fgl::disable-definition vector-kind)
 
 (fgl::def-fgl-rewrite equal-of-vector-kind

<h4>Example 2: Member-Equal</h4>

<p>Member-equal is often used to just test whether or not an object is a member
of a list.  But it returns much more information than that -- it returns the
tail of the list beginning with that object.  Because that extra information is
inconvenient to represent in FGL, we represent it instead in a way that
prevents us from needing to reason about this extra information.</p>

(defxdoc fgl-debugging
  :parents (fgl)
  :short "Tools for debugging FGL failures"
  :long "
<p>In this topic we list some techniques for debugging FGL failures.</p>

<h3>Examining the Stack</h3>

<p>FGL keeps almost all of the state of its interpreter inside its interpreter
state stobj @('interp-st').  In particular, it keeps a stack containing
variable bindings, scratch objects, and debugging information inside this
stobj. Examining this stack to see where FGL ran into an error or where it's
spending time is one of the best tools for debugging FGL problems.</p>

<p>The stack is contained in a nested stobj inside the interpreter state, but
it can be dumped into a regular ACL2 object using the function
@('(fgl::interp-st-extract-stack fgl::interp-st)').  Usually when FGL encounters an error it will also save the stack into a state global @('(@ :fgl-interp-error-debug-stack)').  The FGL clause
processor is typically run on the live interp-st stobj, so if the clause processor is
interrupted during a proof the stack can be retrieved from that stobj, either afterward
from the ACL2 loop or within the raw Lisp break:</p>

@({
 ;; From within the ACL2 loop, save the stack into a constant (using std/util/defconsts.lisp):
 (defconsts *my-stack* (fgl::interp-st-extract-stack fgl::interp-st))
 ;; Or put it in a state global, accessed as (@ :my-stack):
 (f-put-global ':my-stack (fgl::interp-st-extract-stack fgl::interp-st) state)
 ;; The following macro does the same as the call above:
 (fgl::save-fgl-stack :to :my-stack)


 ;; From within a raw Lisp break, save the stack as a defparameter:
 (defparameter *my-stack* (fgl::interp-st-extract-stack (cdr (assoc 'fgl::interp-st *user-stobj-alist*)))
 })

<p>Note: be sure NOT to do the latter when in a raw Lisp break resulting from a
stack overflow! It may cause your Lisp to crash completely.</p>

<p>The stack object's type is @(see major-stack), which is documented under
@(see fgl-stack).  Essentially it is a nonempty list of @(see major-frame)
objects representing scopes such as function calls and rewrite rules.  Each
frame contains some variable bindings and debug info identifying what rule
application that frame represents, as well as a minor stack representing a
nesting of lambdas.</p>

<p>A useful tool for examining a stack object is
@('(fgl::major-stack->debugframes my-stack)'), which returns the debug info
from each of the major frames paired with its index.  Often you can find the
frames you're most interested in by looking at the debug info, and then examine
those frames closer by indexing into the stack with @('nth') etc.</p>

<p>It may be useful to set a lower recursion limit for the FGL interpreter.
The default is 10000, but it may help to catch runaway rule applications to
limit it to 1000 or less.  This can be adjusted by setting the state global
@(':fgl-reclimit').</p>

<h3>Tracing Rewrite Rules</h3>

<p>Most of the work of FGL is done by rewrite rules -- even the expansion of
function definitions is just treated as an application of a rewrite rule.
Tracing rewrites can help debug problems due to rule applications unexpectedly
failing or recurring out of control, etc.  See @(see fgl-rewrite-tracing).</p>

<h3>Profiling</h3>

<p>FGL provides <see topic='@(url acl2::accumulated-persistence)'>accumulated
persistence</see>-style profiling of rewrite rules, concrete executions, and
FGL primitive executions.  These may help debug performance problems by showing
which rules are invoked many times and which rules cause other rules to be
invoked many times.  As with ACL2's accumulated persistence, we count two
numbers for each rule: tries, which simply measures the number of times the
rule is attempted, and frames, which measures how many tries total, including
other rules, happen during a top-level attempted application of the rule.</p>

")


(defxdoc fgl-primitive-and-meta-rules
  :parents (fgl)
  :short "Adding fast-executing primitive routines to FGL."
  :long "

<p>FGL is geared toward doing most reasoning via rewrite rules.  But sometimes
rewrite rules aren't fast enough or are otherwise inadequate for something we
want to do.  For these cases, FGL supports two kinds of custom reasoning
procedures, \"metafunctions\" and \"primitives\".  Metafunctions are more
general than primitives and we will mostly discuss them here.  A metafunction
takes a function and argument list as input and produces a term and binding
alist as output.  A primitive is a specialization of a metafunction that
produces a symbolic object as output rather than a term and binding alist.
When applying a metafunction, the term returned is symbolically interpreted
under the returned bindings, whereas when applying a primitive the symbolic
object is returned directly.</p>

<p>A metafunction is a function that takes a function name @('f'), argument
list (symbolic objects), interpreter state, and state, and returns @('(mv
successp rhs-term bindings interp-st state)'), where successp is a flag
indicating whether the answer is valid.  If so, @('rhs-term') must evaluate
under the evaluation of @('bindings') to @('f') of the evaluations of the
arguments.  The returned @('interp-st') must satisfy several constraints
showing that it was not invalidly modified; usually, all a primitive should do
with the @('interp-st') is build new gates onto the @('aignet') of its
@('logicman') (see @(see fgl-interpreter-state)).  Primitives take the same inputs but
return @('(mv successp obj interp-st state)'), where the evaluation of @('obj')
must equal @('f') of the evaluations of the arguments.</p>

<p>New metafunctions can be defined with the form @('def-fgl-meta') and new
primitives with @('def-fgl-primitive').  However, before the newly defined
metafunctions/primitives may be used, they must be installed into the current
metafunction and primitive dispatcher function using @('install-fgl-metafns').
This creates a new function that wraps all existing metafunctions into a case
statement, and attaches it to the stub @('fgl-meta-fncall-stub').  It also
creates a similar dispatcher function for primitives and another one for binder
meta rules (see @(see binder)).</p>


<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The primitive for @('intcar'), which returns the least-significant bit of
@('(ifix x)') as a Boolean value, is defined in @('primitives.lisp') as
follows:</p>

@({
 (def-fgl-primitive intcar (x)
   (fgl-object-case x
     :g-concrete (mv t (and (integerp x.val)
                            (intcar x.val))
                     interp-st)
     :g-integer (mv t (mk-g-boolean (car x.bits)) interp-st)
     :g-boolean (mv t nil interp-st)
     :g-cons (mv t nil interp-st)
     :g-map (mv t (and (integerp x.alist)
                       (intcar x.alist))
                interp-st)
     :otherwise (mv nil nil interp-st)))
 })

<p>@('Def-fgl-primitive') sets up the correct signature and guards for the
primitive function, extracts the named formals (in this case @('x')) from the
argument list, and proves the necessary theorems to ensure it can be installed
as a primitive.  It stores the association between @('intcar') and the new
primitive function, named @('fgl-intcar-primitive'), in the table
@('fgl-primitives').</p>

<p>To install the primitives listed in @('fgl-primitives'), use
@('(install-fgl-metafns name)'), which defines a new function
@('name-primitive-fncall') that takes a function symbol, argument list,
interp-st, and state, and dispatches based on the function symbol to that
function's primitive, if any (if not, it returns unsuccessful).  This function
is then attached to @('fgl-primitive-fncall-stub'), which is called by the FGL
interpreter to run primitives.</p>

<h3>Formula Checks</h3>

<p>FGL requires that primitives return results that evaluate correctly with
respect to the FGL evaluator, @(see fgl-object-eval) -- that is, the result
object must evaluate to the same thing as the evaluation of the input function
symbol applied to the argument list.  However, @('fgl-object-eval') is based on
an ACL2 evaluator @('fgl-ev') which only understands a limited set of
function symbols.  Naively, this would prevent us from proving that the
primitives evaluate correctly.  However, we are allowed to assume the
correctness of facts we extract from the ACL2 state with respect to
@('fgl-ev') -- see <see topic='@(url acl2::meta-extract)'>meta-extract</see>
for details.  In many cases we can show that when some set of theorems are
stored in the state in the expected form, and the evaluator is assumed to
always evaluate these theorems to non-NIL values, the evaluator then correctly
understands some new function.</p>

<p>As a very simple example, @('(ifix x)') is not understood by @('fgl-ev'),
but it is defined as @('(if (integerp x) x 0)').  All of the functions in its
definition -- @('if'), @('integerp') -- are understood by @('fgl-ev').  So we
can show that @('fgl-ev') understands @('ifix') if we check that the
definition of @('ifix') stored in the state is the one we expect, and also
assume that facts stored in the state are correct with respect to
@('fgl-ev').</p>

<p>We can build up to arbitrarily complex functions, in this way, as long as
they are defined rather than constrained.  For example, if we check that the
definitional formulas for @('='), @('ZIP'), @('FIX'), and @('EXPT') are present
in the world, then we can show that @('fgl-ev') understands @('expt') terms.</p>

<p>In order to define primitives that need to check formulas in order to show
they are correct, we first define a \"formula check\" function, an executable
function that checks that a list of facts are correctly present in the state.
We show that if this formula check function returns true, then the primitive
evaluates correctly.  When installing a new set of primitives, we define a new
formula check function that checks all the facts checked by the formula check
functions depended on by the primitives, and show that it implies each of them.
Then, when running the FGL clause processor, we run that formula check function
to check that all the definitions that primitives depend on are present: doing
this once ahead of time is fast and allows primitives to proceed without
checking any of these facts.</p>

<p>We offer some automation for proving formula check theorems.  For example,
in @('bitops-primitives.lisp'), we use the form</p>
@({
 (def-formula-checks bitops-formula-checks
   (logapp
    acl2::logmask$inline
    acl2::logtail$inline
    acl2::loghead$inline
    logbitp
    integer-length))
 })

<p>This introduces a function @('bitops-formula-checks') which checks all of
the facts necessary to ensure that the listed functions operate as expected.
Then, when defining a primitive that depends on this, we simply add
@(':formula-check bitops-formula-checks') within the def-fgl-primitive form.
For example:</p>

@({
 (def-fgl-primitive acl2::logtail$inline (n x)
   (b* (((unless (fgl-object-case n :g-concrete))
         (mv nil nil interp-st))
        ((mv ok x) (gobj-syntactic-integer-fix x))
        ((unless ok) (mv nil nil interp-st))
        (x-bits (gobj-syntactic-integer->bits x)))
     (mv t (mk-g-integer (tail-bits (nfix (g-concrete->val n)) x-bits))
         interp-st))
   :formula-check bitops-formula-checks)
 })

<p>The @('def-formula-checks') automation currently only supports single
recursion and only uses the base definitions of functions.  However, it would
be possible to extend it to support custom definitions, thereby supporting
mutual recursion using definitions of those functions that equate them to calls
of a flag function.</p>

<p>Constrained functions, and functions that depend on constrained functions,
pose more of a challenge.  But recall that what we're trying to prove is that
if the primitive call succeeds, then its result is equivalent to the input
function call.  If we are to introduce a primitive for a constrained function,
or a function that depends on a constrained function, we must be able to prove
that equal to something in some cases.  It would then suffice to check formulas
that show that in the cases we care about, the evaluation of the function
reduces to some other form.</p>")

<p>While FGL can be used to symbolically simulate logical terms and bitblast
theorems, it can also be used as a programming platform for advanced algorithms
involving SAT checks and a mix of logical and extralogical code.</p>

<h3>Basic Example</h3> 

<p> Suppose we want to check whether several conditions are satisfiable,
summarize the results in an object and pretty-print that summary. </p>

@({
 ;; Suppose (my-test-condition n x) gives the nth condition to be tested.
 (defun my-test-condition (n x) ...)

 ;; Iterate from M-1 down to 0 testing each condition and collect a list of the
 ;; indices of all those that were invalid.
 (def-fgl-program test-my-conditions (m x)
   (if (zp m)
       nil
     (let* ((next-m (1- m))
            ;; Narrow the equivalence context from UNEQUIV to IFF to ensure
            ;; that an accurate result is produced for my-test-condition.
            (testcond (narrow-equiv '(iff) (my-test-condition next-m x)))
            (validity-check-result (fgl-validity-check
                                    (make-fgl-ipasir-config)
                                    testcond))
            ;; Note: validity-check-result is syntactically T if the validity
            ;; check was successful.  If not, it's some symbolic truth value
            ;; represented as a g-boolean object.
            (valid (syntax-interp (eq validity-check-result t))))
        (if valid
            (test-my-conditions next-m x)
          (cons next-m (test-my-conditions next-m x))))))

 ;; Summarize the list of non-valid condition indices.
 (defun my-print-test-condition-results (indices-list) ...)

 ;; Run a fake proof in which the conditions are tested.
 (fgl-thm
   :hyp t
   :concl (fgl-prog2 (let ((conds (test-my-conditions 100 x)))
                       (my-print-test-condition-results conds))
                     t))
 })

<p>In the @('fgl-thm') form, @('fgl-prog2') is used to enter an @('unequiv')
equivalence context, which allows the use of extralogical forms such as
@('syntax-interp').  (Since every pair of objects are @('unequiv'), an
@('unequiv') context allows any term to be rewritten to any other term, or
interpreted in any way that might be desired.  Thus @('syntax-interp'), which
logically just returns @('nil'), can be used to run an arbitrary computation
with no logical meaning and return its result.</p>

<p>The @('fgl-prog2') calls @('test-my-conditions'), which successively checks
the validity of 100 test conditions.  The use of @('narrow-equiv') inside
@('test-my-conditions') ensures that @('my-test-condition') is interpreted
under an @('iff') context instead of an @('unequiv') context.  We then use
@('fgl-validity-check') to check whether the resulting condition is always
non-nil.  If this is found to be true, then @('fgl-validity-check') will return
@('t'), that is, the constant-@('t') symbolic object; otherwise, it will return
some other symbolic Boolean object: either @('nil') or a non-constant
@('g-boolean') object.  To check whether the condition was found to be always
true, we check whether the object resulting from @('fgl-validity-check') is
syntactically @('t').  We collect the indices of those conditions that are not
constant-true.</p>

<p>Note that the body for @('test-my-conditions') above could not exist if
@('test-my-conditions') were to be interpreted under @('equal') rather than
@('unequiv'): it could produce different results on the same inputs depending
on the behavior of @('fgl-validity-check'), which could fail or succeed based
on (for example) the current contents of the interpreter state.  Thus,
logically speaking, @('test-my-conditions') isn't a function.  But under an
@('unequiv') context we can still interpret it as though it were.</p>

(defxdoc fgl-counterexamples
  :parents (fgl)
  :short "Generating counterexamples from SAT checks in FGL"
  :long "<p>When FGL calls a SAT solver and it returns a satisfying assignment,
what we actually have is an assignment for the Boolean variables associated
with various symbolic objects in the Boolean variable database.  Often what we
really want is an assignment to the original variables of the theorem, or to
certain objects within our local context.  This topic discusses FGL's method of
deriving a term-level counterexample from a Boolean-level counterexample.</p>

<p>Note that what we are trying to do is not always possible! The underlying
problem is undecidable, and it depends very much on the set of rules in use
whether there might be interdependencies among the Boolean variables such that
the satisfying assignment for the SAT problem can't be realized in terms of the
theorem variables.  For example, if one Boolean variable is associated with
@('(logbitp 0 x)') and assigned @('T') but another variable is associated with
@('(intcar x)') and assigned @('NIL'), that assignment can't be realized
because the two expressions are equal.  This topic as well as @(see
fgl-getting-bits-from-objects) offer advice for avoiding these
interdependencies and ensuring that term-level counterexamples may be easily
derived from Boolean satisfying assignments.</p>

<p>The input to our computation is essentially an assignment of Boolean values
to various FGL objects, namely the ones associated with Boolean variables in
the Boolean variable database.  More specifically, we have the @('bvar-db')
mapping Boolean variables to FGL objects and an @('env'), the satisfying
assignment for these Boolean variables; but we can view this as an assignment
of values to FGL objects instead, since the names of the Boolean variables are
interchangeable.</p>


<h3>Sketch of Algorithm</h3>

<p>We begin with an assignment @('a') of values to FGL objects, derived from the
@('bvar-db') and @('env').  We want to extend this assignment so that
eventually it includes values for all the theorem variables that are
consistent, i.e. the evaluations of all the objects in @('a') match their
associated values.</p>

<p>The primary way of extending @('a') with new assignment pairs is to apply
certain rules that say how we may derive new assignments from existing ones.
These rules may be added by users.  The following example rules illustrate two
common types:</p>

@({
 (def-ctrex-rule intcar-intcdr-ctrex-elim
   :match ((car (intcar x))
           (cdr (intcdr x)))
   :match-conds ((cdr-match cdr)
                 (car-match car))
   :assign (let ((cdr (if cdr-match cdr (intcdr x)))
                 (car (if car-match car (intcar x))))
             (intcons car cdr))
   :assigned-var x
   :ruletype :elim)

 (def-ctrex-rule assoc-equal-ctrex-rule
   :match ((pair (assoc-equal k x)))
   :assign (put-assoc-equal k (cdr pair) x)
   :assigned-var x
   :ruletype :property)
 })

<p>The first rule says that if we have an assignment of a value to some object
matching @('(intcar x)') (that is, a @(':g-apply') FGL object whose function
symbol is @('intcar')) and an assignment to some other object matching
@('(intcdr x)') (that is, a @(':g-apply') object whose function symbol is
@('intcdr') and whose argument is the same as that of the @('intcar') object),
then we can derive a value for @('x') (the shared argument of the two objects),
namely the @('intcons') of the two values.  If we only have an assignment to
one or the other, @('intcar') or @('intcdr'), then the other part is defaulted
to the @('intcar/intcdr') of any current value tentatively assigned to
@('x').</p>

<p>The second rule says that if we have an assignment of a value @('pair') to
@('(assoc-equal k x)'), then we can modify @('x') to accomodate that by setting
it to @('(put-assoc-equal k (cdr pair) x)').  The @(':property') ruletype, as
distinguished from the @(':elim') ruletype of the previous rule, implies that
this rule can be applied several times to update the assignment to a term
@('x'); i.e. we can build up an alist given the values assigned to several
different keys.</p>

<p>Generally, a value for one term-like object suggests a value for some
subterm object, as in the rules above. However, if an object is composed of
subterms that can be assigned values, then that parent object can be computed
directly from these subterm values.</p>

<p>More details on the implementation of the derivation of counterexamples can
be found under the @(see cgraph) topic.</p>

<p>Counterexamples can be derived and run from SAT calls during rewriting. The
following functions can be used inside a @(see syntaxp), @(see syntax-interp),
or @(see syntax-bind) form:</p>

<ul>

<li>@('interp-st-run-ctrex'): After a satisfiability call produces a SAT
result, fetch the satisfying assignment from the solver (for the given sat-config),
turn the satisfying assignment into a term-level counterexample and
evaluate the top-level goal on that counterexample.</li>

<li>@('interp-st-sat-counterexample'): Fetch the satisfying assignment from
the SAT solver (for the given sat-config) and store it in the FGL interpreter
state. This must be done before the deriving the counterexample using the
functions below; on the other hand, it is not a prerequisite for
@('interp-st-run-ctrex').</li>

<li>@('interp-st-counterex-bindings'): Derive a counterexample from the
latest satisfiable SAT check (if any), and evaluate the given symbolic object
bindings under that counterexample.  Additionally returns the counterexample's
assignment of top-level theorem variables.</li>

<li>@('interp-st-counterex-bindings/print-errors'): like
@('interp-st-counterex-bindings') but also summarizes any counterexample
derivation errors.</li>

<li>@('interp-st-counterex-stack-bindings/print-errors'): like
@('interp-st-counterex-bindings/print-errors') but uses the bindings of the top stack
frame (i.e. the rewrite rule from which this function is called).</li>

<li>@('interp-st-counterex-prev-stack-bindings/print-errors'): like
@('interp-st-counterex-stack-bindings/print-errors') but uses the bindings of
the next-to-top stack frame (i.e. the caller of the rewrite rule from which
this function is called).</li>

</ul>

<p>Counterexample derivation, as well as running the goal term after the
counterexample is derived, uses an evaluator function called
@('magitastic-ev'). This evaluator allows function definitions to be overridden
for the purpose of running counterexamples, by adding entries to a table. This
can be used to speed up counterexample generation or cheat to work around
abstractions that don't allow the production of top-level counterexamples.</p>
