<p>@('Def-fgl-thm') is the main macro used for proving a theorem using FGL.  It
produces a @(see defthm) form containing hints that cause the FGL clause
processor to be used to attempt the proof of the theorem.  Basic usage is as
follows:</p>

@({
 (def-fgl-thm <thmname>
    <theorem-body>
    <keyword-args>)
 })
<p>However, for backward compatibility with GL, the following usage is also supported:</p>
@({
 (def-fgl-thm <thmname>
   :hyp <hyp-term>
   :concl <concl-term>
   <keyword-args>)
 })

<p>The main keyword arguments supported include the fields of the @(see
fgl-config) object, and a few others listed below.  Each field of the
@('fgl-config') object is assigned as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The explicit value given in the @('def-fgl-thm') form, if there is one</li>
<li>Else if the table @('fgl::fgl-config-table') has an entry for the keyword field name, the value to which it is bound</li>
<li>Else if the keyword field name is bound as a state global, its global value</li>
<li>Else the default value defined by @(see make-fgl-config).</li>
</ul>

<p>The non-@('fgl-config') keywords recognized are:</p>
<ul>
<li>@(':hyp') and @(':concl'), used with the backward-compatible usage form above</li>
<li>@(':rule-classes'), giving the rule classes of the theorem proved</li>
<li>@(':hints'), a list of subgoal or computed hints that are listed before the
FGL clause processor hints.</li>
<li>@(':parents'), @(':short'), @(':long'), the usual xdoc documentation
arguments.  If any of these are provided, a @('defsection') containing the
theorem is created, rather than just the theorem.</li>
</ul>

<p>For now, other keyword arguments are accepted and ignored without complaint.
This probably will someday need to change.</p>

<p>@('Def-fgl-param-thm') is similar to @(see def-fgl-thm), but runs a clause
processor prior to FGL that splits the goal into several cases based on the
provided arguments.  It somewhat replicates the behavior of @(see
gl::def-gl-param-thm), but ignores the shape specifiers provided for the
various cases.</p>

<p>The usage of @('def-fgl-param-thm') is similar to that of @(see
def-fgl-thm), but it accepts several more keyword arguments:</p>

<ul>

<li>@(':param-bindings') is the same as in @(see gl::def-gl-param-thm), but
the shape specifier alist in each entry is ignored.</li>

<li>@(':param-hyp') is the same as in @(see gl::def-gl-param-thm).</li>

<li>@(':split-params') provides the @(see fgl-sat-check) parameters object for
proving that case split provided covers all cases.</li>

<li>@(':solve-params') provides the @(see fgl-sat-check) object for proving each case.</li>

<li>@(':repeat-concl-p') controls whether the conclusion is (if nil)
rewritten/symbolically executed once and then solved separately for each case,
or (if nonnil) rewritten/symbolically executed (and also solved) separately for
each case.</li>
