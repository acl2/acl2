arranges so that various list recognizers like @(see integer-listp), @(see
boolean-listp), etc., can be directly used with FTY.</p>

<p>Special note: even though @(see character-listp) and @(see string-listp)
aren't listed below, you will still be able to use them with FTY after
including the @('baselists') book.  For historical reasons these types are
defined in a special way in the @(see std/strings) library, see in particular
@(see str::equivalences).</p>")
