; Matt K. mod 5/2016 (type-set bit for {1}): the addition of a type-set bit for
; the set {1} sent the proof in a different direction with this rewrite rule.
; Monitoring this rule shows that (EQUAL (BINARY-+ '-1 SIZE) '0) rewrites to
; (EQUAL SIZE '1), so with the new type-set bit for {1}, it isn't surprising
; that the proof goes in a different direction than before.
