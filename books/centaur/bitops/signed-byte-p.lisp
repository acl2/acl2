; That concludes the positive/positive case.
; Recall that we want to show:
;
; -2^{n-1} <= a < 2^{n-1}
; -2^{n-1} <= b < 2^{n-1}
;   ===>
; -2^{ n+n-1 } <= ab < 2^{ n+n-1 }
;
; Now let's do the positive * negative case.  WLOG suppose A is positive and B
; is negative.  Now obviously AB is negative so we'll focus on the lower bound
; only.  That is, we want to show:
;
;   -2^{n-1} <= ab
;
; Let V be the -B.  Then obviously AB = -AV and we are trying to show:
;
;   -2^{n-1} <= -av
;
; Multiplying each side by negative 1 flips the inequality, so our goal is:
;
;   av <= 2^{n-1}
;
; Here is what we know:
;
;   0 <= a < 2^{n-1}
;   0 <  v <= 2^{n-1}
;
; This is now exactly the same as the positive case, except that the bound on v
; is only "<=" instead of "<".  The same argument as above still applies, but we
; have to modify it to accommodate the weaker bound.

; Unfortunately the asymmetry of signed-byte-p makes the signed-byte-p
; lemmas for truncate and floor ugly.
;
; You might normally think of division as decreasing the magnitude of the
; numerator.  But there is a bad case.  If we divide the minimum n-bit signed
; integer by -1, the asymmetry of 2's complement arithmetic means we get a
; result that is too large to represent.  For example, for N=32:
;
;   (defconst *int-min* (- (expt 2 31)))
;   (signed-byte-p 32 *int-min*)               ;; T
;   (signed-byte-p 32 (truncate *int-min* -1)) ;; NIL(!) -- it's 2^31
;   (signed-byte-p 32 (floor *int-min* -1))    ;; NIL -- 2^31
;
; As a result, our final theorems have to rule out this one special case.  The
; proof is a bit long/involved, but is essentially very simple and just boils
; down to cases about whether the numerator/denominator are positive/negative.
