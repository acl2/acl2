  :long "<p>Truncation warnings are really, really good to have, and have found
many bugs.  However, if we just issue a truncation warning about everything, we
find that there are way too many nitpicky warnings and it's hard to go through
them all.  So, we want to be clever and not warn in certain cases that we have
seen where the truncation really doesn't matter.  Efficiency is of no concern
because this is called so infrequently.</p>

<p>Probably the biggest source of spurious truncation warnings is from the use
of unsized numbers like 0 and 1.  It's a pretty good bet that any truncation
from 32-bits to some other number of bits is no big deal and is just being
caused by a unsized number.</p>

<p>At any rate, we now have a notion of expression that are okay to truncate.
We basically don't want to complain about things like</p>

@({
    assign foo[3:0] = 0;              // 32 bits, but who cares, it fits

    assign foo[3:0] = 5'd7;           // 5 bits, but who cares, it still fits

    assign foo[3:0] = x0 ? 5'h0 :     // each are 5 bits, but who cares, they
                      x1 ? 5'h1 :     // still fit.

many bugs.  However, we need to be pretty clever to avoid getting too many
trivial, nitpicky complaints about assignments that aren't really bugs.</p>

<p>This hook can be used with @(see defattach) to customize exactly how
extension warnings are filtered out and easily experiment with new heuristics.
See @(see vl-default-extension-warning-hook) for the arguments.  The task of
your function is to classify the type of warning to issue.  Typically the type
should be one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>@('nil') - do not issue any warnings about this extension,</li>
<li>@(':vl-warn-extension') - issue a default warning, or</li>
<li>@(':vl-warn-extension-minor') - issue a minor warning.</li>
</ul>

<p>However in principle you can return any warning type you like.</p>

<p>Note that your function will only be called when there is an extension
taking place, so it is generally fine to use a function that is relatively
expensive or inefficient here.</p>
