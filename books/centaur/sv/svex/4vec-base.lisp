  :short "The fundamental 4-valued vector representation used throughout SV
@(see expressions)."

  :long "<p>In hardware description languages like Verilog and SystemVerilog,
each bit can typically take one of four values, named 1, 0, X, or Z.  For some
background see for instance the @(see acl2::4v) library and in particular @(see
acl2::why-4v-logic).</p>

<p>A <b>4vec</b> represents a ``infinite width'' vector of 4-valued bits, i.e.,
each bit of a 4vec can be either 1, 0, X, or Z.  4vecs are fundamental to the
@(see sv) expression representation: the variables in each expression are
4vec-valued, and each expression produces a result that is a 4vec.</p>

<p>The concrete representation of a 4vec is either:</p>

<ul>
<li>an integer (for special cases where there are no X/Z bits), or</li>
<li>a pair of integers, say @('(upper . lower)').</li>
</ul>

<p>In the latter case, the value of each 4-valued bit is determined by the
corresponding bits in the two integers:</p>

<ul>

<li>If the corresponding bits are equal, the resulting bit is the shared
value (1 or 0).</li>

<li>Otherwise, if the <i>upper</i> bit is 1 and the <i>lower</i> 0, then the
resulting value is X.</li>

<li>Otherwise, the <i>upper</i> bit is 0 and the <i>lower</i> 1, then the
resulting value is Z.</li>

</ul>

<p>Examples:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Representation</th><th>Meaning (LSB first)</th></tr>
<tr><td>6</td>        <td>0,1,1,0,0,0,...infinitely many 0s...</td></tr>
<tr><td>-13</td>      <td>1,1,0,0,1,1,...infinitely many 1s...</td></tr>
<tr><td>(6 . -13)</td><td>Z,1,X,0,Z,Z,...infinitely many Zs...</td></tr>
</table>

<p>A 4vec should generally be @(see hons)ed if it is going to be used in an
expression, but it is better to avoid the expense of honsing ephemeral 4vecs,
e.g., those that arise during evaluation.  Accordingly we provide both @(see
make-4vec) and @(see make-honsed-4vec).</p>

<p>We provide a @('4vec') @(see b*) binder that allows you to access, e.g.,</p>

@({
      (b* (((4vec x)))          ==   (list :lower (4vec->lower x)
        (list :lower x.lower               :upper (4vec->upper x))
              :upper x.upper))
