; These are Jared's preferred settings for using ACL2.  He has put them into
; into this centaur/jared-customization.lsp file, instead of leaving them in
; his home directory, to make it easy to keep his settings shared across any
; machines that he wants to use (e.g., at work and at home).
;
; As a user that doesn't equal Jared, you probably want to use
; books/std/std-customization.lsp.  See that file more more instrutions.
;
; If you decide you still want to use this, the easiest option is to just add
; an acl2-customization.lsp file to your home directory that says:
;
;   (ld "centaur/jared-customization.lsp" :dir :system)
;
; You can, of course, put whatever additional customization you want in your
; own customization file, then.



; There's no in-package here, because it could screw up packages loaded by
; custom acl2-customization.lsp files.  Instead we use the #!ACL2 syntax to try
; to make sure this file can be read from any package.

; Rager is leaving it to Jared to decide whether Jared wants to uncomment the
; follownig ld and remove the redundant events, but he hopes that Jared will
; give him the approval to do so.  This would help avoid forking.

; XDOC SUPPORT
;
;   - Always load the xdoc package, which is pretty fast.
;
;   - Unless :SUPPRESS-PRELOAD-XDOC has been assigned, also get the xdoc
;     database preloaded so that :XDOC commands are very fast and never
;     leave any nonsense in your history.
;
; The second part is somewhat slow and makes ACL2 take noticeably longer to
; boot up.  However, for me, on the par, it seems worth it to make :xdoc much
; more useful.
;
; The suppress-preload-xdoc mechanism can be used to make sure that xdoc does
; NOT get preloaded.  Why would you want to do this?
;
; Well, a few libraries (e.g., str) have some files (package definitions,
; str::cat, etc.) that are included in the xdoc implementation code that gets
; loaded by (xdoc::colon-xdoc-init).  When you're hacking on these libraries,
; it's very easy to, e.g., change something that causes xdoc to be completely
; unloadable until you recertify everything.
;
; At any rate, if for this (or some other reason) you don't want to
; automatically do this xdoc initialization, you can just add:
;
;   (assign :suppress-preload-xdoc t)
;
; Before loading jared-customization.lsp.
