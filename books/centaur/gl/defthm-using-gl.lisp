  "<p>
   This macro generates
   (1) a local theorem proved via GL and
   (2) a non-local theorem proved trivially from the previous one.
   GL must be included at least locally
   in order for the first theorem to work,
   but GL may be included just locally,
   and the second theorem will work.
   This helps reduce dependencies among books.
