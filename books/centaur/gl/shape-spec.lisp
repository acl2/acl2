  :short "Simplified symbolic objects useful for coverage proofs in GL."

  :long "<p>Shape specifiers are a simplified format of GL symbolic objects,
capable of representing Booleans, numbers, conses, free variables, and function
calls.  While less expressive than full-fledged symbolic objects, shape spec
objects make it easier to prove coverage lemmas necessary for proving theorems
by symbolic simulation.  Here, we document common constructions of shape-spec
objects and what it means to prove coverage.</p>

<h3>Creating Shape Spec Objects</h3>

<p>Shape spec objects are analogues of <see topic=\"@(url
gl::symbolic-objects)\">symbolic objects</see>, but with several tweaks that make
it more straightforward to prove that a given concrete object is covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Symbolic objects contain arbitrary Boolean formulas (BDDs or AIGs), whereas
shape specifiers are restricted to contain only independent Boolean variables.
Therefore, every bit in a shape specifier is independent from every other
bit.</li>
<li>The @(':g-apply') symbolic object construct is replaced by the @(':g-call')
shape specifier construct.  The @(':g-call') object has an additional field that holds a
user-provided inverse function, which is useful for proving coverage; see @(see
g-call).</li>
</ul>

<p>Shape spec objects may be created using the following constructors
 (roughly in order of usefulness).  Additionally, a non-keyword atom is a shape
spec representing itself:</p>

<dl>

<dt>@('(G-BOOLEAN <num>)')</dt>

<dd>Represents a Boolean.  @('num') (a natural number) may not be repeated in
any other @(':G-BOOLEAN') or @(':G-NUMBER') construct in the shape-spec.</dd>

<dt>@('(G-INTEGER <list-of-nums>)')</dt>

<dd>Represents a two's-complement integer with bits corresponding to the list,
least significant bit first.  Rationals and complex rationals are also
available; see @(see SYMBOLIC-OBJECTS).  A :G-INTEGER construct with a list of
length @('N') represents integers @('X') where @('(<= (- (expt 2 (+ -1 n))) x)') and
@('(< x (expt 2 (+ -1 n)))').  The @('list-of-nums') must be natural numbers, may not
repeat, and may not occur in any other @(':G-BOOLEAN') or @(':G-INTEGER')/
@(':G-NUMBER') construct.</dd>

<dt>@('(G-NUMBER (list <list-of-nums>))')</dt>
<dd>Same as the @('G-INTEGER') form above, for backward compatibility.</dd>

<dt>@('(cons <Car> <Cdr>)')</dt>

<dd>Represents a cons; Car and Cdr should be well-formed shape specifiers.</dd>

<dt>@('(G-VAR <name>)')</dt>

<dd>A free variable that may represent any object.  This is primarily useful
when using GL's term-level capabilities; see @(see term-level-reasoning).</dd>

<dt>@('(G-CALL <fnname> <arglist> <inverse>)')</dt>

<dd>Represents a call of the named function applied to the given arguments.
The @('inverse') does not affect the symbolic object generated, which is
@('(:G-APPLY <fnname> . <arglist>)'), but is used in the coverage proof; see
@(see g-call). This construct is primarily useful when using GL's term-level
capabilities; see @(see term-level-reasoning).</dd>

<dt>@('(G-ITE <test> <then> <else>)')</dt>
<dd>Represents an if/then/else, where @('test'), @('then'), and @('else') are
shape specs.</dd>

</dl>


<h3>What is a Coverage Proof?</h3>

<p>In order to prove a theorem by symbolic simulation, one binds each variable
mentioned in the theorem to a symbolic object and then symbolically simulates
the conclusion of the theorem on these symbolic objects.  If the result is
true, what can we conclude?  It depends on the coverage of the symbolic inputs.
For example, one might symbolically simulate the term @('(< (+ A B) 7)') with
@('A') and @('B') bound to symbolic objects representing two-bit natural
numbers and recieve a result of @('T').  From this, it would be fallacious to
conclude @('(< (+ 6 8) 7)'), because the symbolic simulation didn't cover the
case where @('A') was 6 and @('B') 7.  In fact, it isn't certain that we can
conclude @('(< (+ 2 2) 7)') from our symbolic simulation, because the symbolic
object bindings for @('A') and @('B') might have interedependencies such that
@('A') and @('B') can't simultaneously represent 2.  (For example, the bindings
could be such that bit 0 of @('A') and @('B') are always opposite.)  In order
to prove a useful theorem from the result of such a symbolic simulation, we
must show that some set of concrete input vectors is covered by the symbolic
objects bound to @('A') and @('B').  But in general, it is a tough
computational problem to determine the set of concrete input vectors that are
covered by a given symbolic input vector.</p>

<p>To make these determinations easier, shape spec objects are somewhat
restricted.  Whereas symbolic objects generally use BDDs (or AIGs, depending on
the <see topic=\"@(url modes)\">mode</see>) to represent
individual Booleans or bits of numeric values (see @(see symbolic-objects)),
shape specs instead use natural numbers representing Boolean variables.
Additionally, shape specs are restricted such that no Boolean variable number may
be used more than once among the bindings for the variables of a theorem; this
prevents interdependencies among them.</p>

<p>While in general it is a difficult problem to determine whether a symbolic
object can evaluate to a given concrete object, a function
@('SHAPE-SPEC-OBJ-IN-RANGE') can make that determination about shape specs.
@('SHAPE-SPEC-OBJ-IN-RANGE') takes two arguments, a shape spec and some object,
and returns T if that object is in the coverage set of the shape spec, and NIL
otherwise.  Therefore, if we wish to conclude that shape specs bound to @('A')
and @('B') cover all two-bit natural numbers, we may prove the following
theorem:</p>

@({
 (implies (and (natp a) (< a 4)
               (natp b) (< b 4))
          (shape-spec-obj-in-range (list a-binding b-binding)
                                   (list a b)))
})

<p>When proving a theorem using the GL clause processor, variable bindings are
given as shape specs so that coverage obligations may be stated in terms of
@('SHAPE-SPEC-OBJ-IN-RANGE').  The shape specs are converted to symbolic
objects and may be parametrized based on some restrictions from the hypotheses,
restricting their range further.  Thus, in order to prove a theorem about
fixed-length natural numbers, for example, one may provide a shape specifier
that additionally covers negative integers of the given length; parametrization
can then restrict the symbolic inputs used in the simulation to only cover the
naturals, while the coverage proof may still be done using the simpler,
unparametrized shape spec.</p>")

  :parents (shape-specs term-level-reasoning)
  :short "A shape-spec representing a function call."
  :long
  "<p>Note: This is an advanced topic.  You should first read @(see
term-level-reasoning) to see whether this is of interest, then be familiar with
@(see shape-specs) before reading this.</p>

<p>@('G-CALL') is the constructor for a shape-spec representing a function
call.  Usage:</p>

@({
  (g-call <function name>
          <list of argument shape-specs>
          <inverse function>)
 })

<p>This yields a G-APPLY object (see @(see symbolic-objects)):</p>
@({
  (g-apply <function name>
           <list of argument symbolic objects>)
 })

<p>The inverse function field does not affect the symbolic object that is
generated from the g-call object, but it determines how we attempt to prove the
coverage obligation.</p>

<p>The basic coverage obligation for assigning some variable V a shape spec SS
is that for every possible value of V satisfying the hypotheses, there must be
an environment under which the symbolic object derived from SS evaluates to
that value.  The coverage proof must show that there exists such an
environment.</p>

<p>Providing an inverse function INV basically says:</p>

<p><box>
   \"If we need (FN ARGS) to evaluate to VAL, then ARGS should be (INV VAL).\"
</box></p>

<p>So to prove that (G-CALL FN ARGS INV) covers VAL, we first prove that ARGS
cover (INV VAL), then that (FN (INV VAL)) equals VAL.  The argument that this
works is:</p>

<ul>

<li>We first prove ARGS covers (INV VAL) -- that is, there exists some
environment E under which the symbolic objects derived from ARGS evaluate
to (INV VAL).</li>

<li>Since (FN (INV VAL)) equals VAL, this same environment E suffices to make
the symbolic object (FN ARGS) evaluate to VAL.</li>

</ul>

<p>We'll now show an example. We build on the memory example discussed in @(see
term-level-reasoning).  Suppose we want to initially assign a memory object
@('mem') a symbolic value under which address 1 has been assigned a 10-bit
integer.  That is, we want to be able to assume only the following about
@('mem'):</p>

@({
  (signed-byte-p 10 (access-mem 1 mem))
 })

<p>Assuming our memory follows the standard record rules, i.e.</p>

@({
  (update-mem addr (access-mem addr mem) mem) = mem,
})

<p>we can represent any such memory as</p>

@({
  (update-mem 1 <some 10-bit integer> <some memory>)
})

<p>Our shape-spec for this will therefore be:</p>

@({
 (g-call 'update-mem
         (list 1
               (g-integer (list 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)) ;; 10-bit integer
               (g-var 'mem)) ;; free variable
         <some inverse function>)
})

<p>What is an appropriate inverse?  The inverse needs to take any memory
satisfying our assumption and generate the list of necessary arguments to
update-mem that fit this template.  The following works:</p>

@({
   (lambda (m) (list 1 (access-mem 1 m) m))
})

<p>because for any value m satisfying our assumptions,</p>

<ul>

<li>the first argument returned is 1, which is covered by our shape-spec 1</li>

<li>the second argument returned will (by the assumption) be a 10-bit integer,
which is covered by our g-number shape-spec</li>

<li>the third argument returned matches our g-var shape-spec since anything at
all is covered by it</li>

<li>the final term we end up with is:
@({
        (update-mem 1 (access-mem 1 m) m)
})
    which (by the record rule above) equals m.</li>

</ul>

<p>GL tries to manage coverage proofs itself, and when using G-CALL constructs
some rules besides the ones it typically uses may be necessary -- for example,
the redundant record update rule used here.  You may add these rules to the
rulesets used for coverage proofs as follows:</p>

<p>This feature has not yet been widely used and the detailed mechanisms
