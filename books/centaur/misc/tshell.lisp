  :short "A fancy alternative to @(see sys-call) that features output streaming
and capture, exit-code capture, interruption, and better control over when
forking occurs."

  :long "<p><b>Tshell</b> is an ACL2 wrapper around the <a
href='https://github.com/jaredcdavis/shellpool/'>Shellpool</a> library for
Common Lisp, which is available via @(see quicklisp).  It allows you to run
external programs from within ACL2, and has many nice features for handling
output, etc.</p>

<p>Shellpool has its own <a
href='https://github.com/jaredcdavis/shellpool/blob/master/DOC.md'>API
documentation</a>, which you may find useful.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>Note that Tshell requires @(see trust-tag)s because its implementation
requires some raw Lisp code.  The book to load is:</p>

@({
    (include-book \"centaur/misc/tshell\" :dir :system)
})

<p>After loading this book, the first step is then to launch one or more
shells, e.g.,</p>

@({
    (value-triple (tshell-ensure))
})

<p>This is a thin wrapper around @('shellpool:ensure').  It launches the
subsidiary bash shells that tshell/shellpool will use to run programs.  This
step requires forking ACL2 itself, so you typically want to do this early in
your ACL2 session, before you have allocated tons of memory.</p>

<p>After that, you can start launching programs using @(see tshell-call) or
@(see tshell-run-background).  For instance,</p>

@({
    ACL2 !>(tshell-call \"echo hello\")
    (tshell-call \"echo hello\")
    hello             ;; <-- output from subprogram, streamed
    (0 (\"hello\"))   ;; <-- exit code 0, output lines
})")

  :long "<p>We usually instead use @(see tshell-ensure), which only starts up
new bash processes if they aren't already running.</p>

<p>If you want to use this in a book, you can wrap it in a @(see value-triple),
e.g.,</p>

@({ (value-triple (tshell-start)) })
