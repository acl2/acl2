  :long "<p>Verilog allows wires to be implicitly declared in certain
cases.</p>

<p>Historically, VL added explicit declarations for these wires as part of the
@(see loader), even before a proper @(see vl-module-p) structures were
generated.  This allowed all transforms to expect that every wire should have a
declaration.  It also allowed us to consider the order of module elements,
without having to rely on some technique such as the @(see vl-location-p)s
associated with module elements, which could be unreliable if a module spans
multiple files, e.g., because of includes.</p>

<p>When we added support for SystemVerilog @('import') statements, we found
this approach to be tricky.  In particular, to decide whether we need to add a
declaration for some particular wire @('foo'), we now need to consider whether
@('foo') is defined by any imported package.  For this, we really want to be
able to inspect the whole @(see vl-design) while making implicit wires.</p>

<p>We therefore decided to split making implicit wires out of the parser and
into a proper transform.  However, we generally expect to run this transform
very early, perhaps even as the first step after parsing.  Normally this should
be done as part of the @(see annotate) transform.</p>

<p>Note that this transform is somewhat unique.  It is the only transform that
considers the module elements in the order that they occur in the file.  It
reads this information from the @('loaditems') field of the @(see vl-module).
As part of this transform, the @('loaditems') field is <b>cleared</b>.  Other
transforms should never use @('loaditems').</p>


<h3>Implicit Wires in the Verilog-2005 Standard</h3>

<p>When a wire is implicitly declared, its type is controlled by the
@('`default_nettype') compiler directive (Section 19.2).  But VL's @(see
preprocessor) does not yet support this directive and will cause an error if it
is used, so for now we can safely assume any implicit wires should just have
type @('wire').  (We can probably add support @('default_nettype') without too
much work, since our new approach of going through the module elements
sequentially means that we have easy access to location information.)</p>

<p>We think wires need to be declared, explicitly or implicitly, before being
used.  The Verilog-2005 standard seems not to explicitly say whether or not
this is the case, and the language at the start of Section 4.5 is somewhat
vague: we are supposed to assume implicit nets <i>in the absence of an explicit
declaration</i> in certain situations.  But later in 4.5 we find some language
that pretty strongly suggests we are only to consider whether or not there is
an explicit declaration <i>before</i> the use of the net: \"<i>and that
identifier has not been <b>declared previously</b> in the scope...</i>.\"</p>

<p>Section 4.5 outlines the conditions under which an implicit wire declaration
is supposed to be made.  In each case, the implicit declaration is to be added
to the nearest scope, but it seems like this only matters in the case of
@('generate') blocks, which we don't currently support.  (You might think that
it would matter for functions, tasks, and named blocks as well, but it doesn't
seem possible to use implicit wires in these contexts, see bullet #4 below for
details).</p>

<p>Note: I think that throughout Section 4.5, the words <i>port expression
declaration</i> are a typo that should be <i>port declaration</i>; nowhere else
in the Verilog-2005 standard do the words <i>port expression declaration</i>
occur, at least according to Acrobat's find function.)</p>

<h4>Case 1</h4>

<p>If there is a port declaration like @('input [3:0] i;') that has no
corresponding wire declaration, then we are supposed to infer an implicit net
with the vector width of the \"port expression declaration,\" which I think
means the @('[3:0]') part.  This seems basically reasonable when you just read
it, but there are a lot of subtle issues that arise; see #7 below for some
experiments.</p>

<p>Note that per 12.3.3, a port declaration like @('input wire [3:0] i;') is
treated as both an input declaration and an explicit wire declaration.  We
don't have to do anything special to handle this, because the parser
automatically builds both a @(see vl-portdecl-p) and a @(see vl-vardecl-p) for
such declarations; see @(srclink vl-parse-port-declaration-noatts).</p>

<h4>Case 2</h4>

<p>If there is an undeclared identifier in the terminal list of a primitive or
module instance, or in the left-hand side of a continuous assignment statement,
then we are supposed to infer an implicit, scalar net.</p>

<p>I think a \"primitive instance\" is supposed to mean either a gate instance
or a user-defined primitive instance.  See for instance Section 7.1.6, which
talks about \"primitive instance connection lists\" in reference to gates, and
11.6.6 where primitive terminals are distinguished from module ports.  So, this
means we should infer implicit wires in the ports/terminals of any instance,
regardless of whether it's a gate/udp/module.</p>


<h3>Implicit Wires in Verilog Implementations</h3>

<p>We developed some tests (see @('test/test-implicit.v')) to see how
Verilog-XL and NCVerilog handle implicit wires.  Here are our findings.</p>

<p><b>#1</b>.  As expected, both allow implicit wires to be inferred from the
arguments of gate and module instances.  This seems to be the intent of Case
2.</p>

<p><b>#2</b>.  As expected, both complain about undeclared wires on the
right-hand side of an @('assign') statement.  This seems to agree with Case
2.</p>

<p><b>#3</b>.  As expected, NCVerilog allows us to infer implicit nets from the
left-hand sides of @('assign') elements.  Unfortunately, Verilog-XL complains
about such wires, which seems to contradict the Verilog-2005 standard.  As a
compromise, our approach is to mimick NCVerilog and infer the implicit net, but
warn that some other tools like Verilog-XL may not allow the construct.</p>

<p>A subtle case is, what if #2 and #3 overlap, i.e., an undeclared wire occurs
on both the left-hand and right-hand sides?  NCVerilog seems to process the
left-hand side first, and hence it allows us to infer an implicit wire for
@('w') when we give it an assignment like @('assign w = w').  This isn't
entirely contrived; someone might occasionally write things like @('assign {a,
abar} = {foo, ~a}').</p>

<p><b>#4</b>.  Mostly as expected, neither tool allows undeclared wires on
either side of an assignment in an always block.  The tools even reject
implicit wires in procedural continuous assignments, e.g., @('always @(b)
assign w = a;').  But this seems arguably incorrect: is not a procedural
continuous assignment also a continuous assignment, whose LHS should therefore
be able to contain implicit wires?</p>

<p>We mimick these tools and disallow the implicit net, even thought the spec
might perhaps be interpreted as allowing it, because it allows us to avoid
certain scoping issues.  In particular, suppose we see a procedural continuous
assignment statement, @('assign w = ...'), where @('w') is not declared.  If
this statement occurs in a task or a named block within an initial/always
statement, should the declaration for @('w') be added to the module or to this
more local scope?  I'm not sure.  So, the good thing about not inferring
implicit nets for these assignments is that I don't have to be able to answer
the question, because I'm not going to infer a net anyway.</p>

<p><b>#5</b>.  As expected, neither implementation tolerates undeclared wires
on either side of assignments in function bodies.  This seems perfectly
reasonable since functions aren't allowed to have procedural continuous
assignments (10.4.4 E).</p>

<p><b>#6</b> As expected, both Verilog-XL and NCVerilog require that all wires
be declared (either explicitly or implicitly) before they are used.  For
instance, they if @('a') is declared but @('w') is not, then they reject code
fragments such as:</p>

@({
assign a = w;   // error here, saying w is undeclared
wire w;
})

<p>And also for code like this:</p>

@({
not(a, w);
wire w;         // error here, saying w is implicitly declared above
})


<p><b>#7</b> The whole declare-before-use thing is pretty strange for ports.
Suppose @('c') is a port of the module.  Then, both NCVerilog and Verilog-XL
will complain if you try to write:</p>

@({
wire c2 = c;    // error here, saying c is not declared.
input c;
})

<p>Verilog-XL seems to require the port declaration to come before the wire
declaration, if any.  That is, it considers the following an error, whereas
NCVerilog allows it:</p>

@({
wire c;
input c;
})

<p>This seems to hold for implicit declarations, too.  For instance, Verilog-XL
rejects the following, but NCVerilog allows it:</p>

@({
buf(c, c2);     // implicit declaration of wire c here
input c;
})

<p>But both Verilog-XL and NCVerilog allow the following, even though you might
think the buf gate would introduce an implicit declaration of @('c') that would
conflict with the explicit declaration.</p>

@({
input c;
buf(c, c2);
wire c;
})

<p>We try to be permissive and mimick NCVerilog, but add a (non-fatal) warning
if a wire's net declaration comes before its port declaration to explain that
some other tools do not permit this.</p>


<h3>Other Notes</h3>

<p>In previous versions of VL, we allowed declarations to come in any order,
and inferred an implicit wire whenever a wire was used in a context that
permitted it.  We now try to be more faithful to other Verilog systems and
require that wires be declared before their first uses, since this seems like
the right way to interpret the Verilog-2005 standard.</p>

<p>With regard to Case 1, we add a net declaration for each port declaration
that is missing a corresponding wire declaration.  In the process, we make sure
that at least some declaration (be it a wire or port declaration) of each port
occurs before every use of the port.  If only a wire declaration occurs before
some use of the port wire, we issue a non-fatal warning saying that Verilog-XL
does not tolerate this ordering.</p>

<p>When we add implicit wires for ports, we use the range of the port
declaration, which seems to be correct with respect to the \"vector width of
the port declaration expression,\" described above.  We also keep the
signedness of the port, which isn't discussed above, but appears to be the
correct thing to do; see @(see portdecl-sign) for details.  We place the
implicit wire declaration at the same location as the corresponding port
declaration, which seems like the easiest place to put it.  We also mark each
implicit wire declaration with the @('VL_PORT_IMPLICIT') attribute.  This
attribute is used by the @(see printer) to avoid printing any net declarations
that were implicit.</p>

<p>With regard to Case 2, we add one-bit wire declarations for any undeclared
wires that occur within the port arguments of gate and module instances, and
which occur in the left-hand sides of continuous assignments.  For assignments,
we always issue a non-fatal warning that says Verilog-XL doesn't add implicit
nets here, and we always process the left-hand side first (like NCVerilog).  We
add the wire declarations at the locations in which they are implicitly
declared, and mark them with the @('VL_IMPLICIT') attribute, which is useful in
@(see typo-detection).</p>")

; FEATURE-CREEP WARNING.
;
; It is tempting to try to do a lot here, e.g., we might want to check for any
; illegally redefined wires, compatibility between port and net declarations,
; etc.  But after some false starts down this road, I think this is a mistake.
;
; We only need to care about the order of elements to (1) properly handle
; adding implicit wires, and (2) make sure things are defined before being
; used.  Other kinds of well-formedness checks, e.g., that make sure nothing is
; multiply defined, that the ports/netdecls agree, etc., really don't need to
; consider module element order, so keep them separate!
