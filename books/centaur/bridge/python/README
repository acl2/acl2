#+TITLE: ACL2 Bridge Python Bindings

* Demo

** Basics
This demo is a minimal ACL2 REPL using Python bindings for the ACL2 bridge.  It
will only accept one line of input and does no syntax checking.  ACL2 errors are
displayed without disrupting the REPL.

- ~acl2_bridge.Client~ :: Synchronous bindings
- ~acl2_bridge.AsyncClient~ :: Asynchronous bindings

** Setup
1. Start ACL2 in a shell
2. Run ~(ld "demo.lsp")~ in ACL2
3. Run ~python demo.py~ (or ~python async_demo.py~) in another shell
4. Use ~^D~ to exit

* Notes
- See the demo(s) and docstrings for usage.
- Only the Unix socket interface is implemented.  Adding security to the bridge
  protocol is a higher priority than adding a network interface for these Python
  bindings.
