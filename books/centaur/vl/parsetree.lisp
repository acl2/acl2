  :short "Internal representation of the syntax of Verilog and SystemVerilog."

  :long "<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>A core component of @(see VL) is its internal representation of Verilog's
syntactic structures.  For each kind of Verilog construct (expressions,
statements, declarations, instances, etc.) we introduce corresponding ``types''
with their own recognizer, constructor, and accessor functions.</p>

<p>These structures generally correspond fairly closely to parse trees in the
SystemVerilog grammar, except that:</p>

<ul>

<li>We sometimes make certain <b>simplifications</b> to present a more regular
view of the source code.  For instance, whereas in a normal Verilog module you
might write something like @('wire [3:0] a, b, c;') to simultaneously declare
several wires, our internal representation treats each wire declaration
separately, as if you had instead written @('wire [3:0] a; wire [3:0] b; wire
[3:0] c;').</li>

<li>We generally <b>separate</b> the various kinds of parsed elements (e.g.,
assignments, declarations, etc.) out into distinct lists, whereas in the source
code these elements may be all mixed together.  This is sometimes slightly
tricky; see also the @(see loader) and the @(see annotate) transform.</li>

<li>Many structures also contain various <b>additional fields</b> that are not
purely part of the syntax.  For instance, many structures include @(see
vl-location) annotations to say where they came from, expressions include
annotations about whether they have explicit parentheses, and high-level design
elements like modules have @(see warnings) attached to them.</li>

</ul>

<p>We introduce all of these structures using the @(see fty) library and
following the fixtype discipline.  This generally means that each type has an
associated fixing function, equivalence relation, etc.  If you aren't familiar
with fty, you may want to learn a bit about it before trying to understand
these structures.</p>

<h3>Quick Guide</h3>

<p>SystemVerilog is a huge language (the grammar is about 45 pages!) so it can
be easy to get lost in all of the different kinds of constructs.  Here is a
quick guide to the most major syntactic definitions:</p>

<ul>

<li>@(see vl-design) is our top-level representation of an <b>entire
design</b>, including all of the modules, interfaces, packages, programs, etc.,
typically spread out across many Verilog or SystemVerilog source files.  If you
start here and then drive down into the fields, you'll eventually explore all
of our syntactic constructs.</li>

<li>Many kinds of major <b>design elements</b> can occur in a design, e.g.,
modules, interfaces, packages, programs, configs, user defined primitives, etc.
We represent these with, e.g., @(see vl-module), @(see vl-interface), @(see
vl-package), @(see vl-program), @(see vl-config), @(see vl-udp), etc.</li>

<li><b>Modules</b> are the mainstay of most designs.  Most modules contain
things like assignments, gate and module instances, always blocks, initial
blocks, aliases, and so on.  We represent these module elements using, e.g.,
@(see vl-assign), @(see vl-gateinst), @(see vl-modinst), @(see vl-always),
@(see vl-initial), @(see vl-final), @(see vl-alias), etc.</li>

<li>Other widely used constructs include <b>declarations</b> of many kinds,
e.g., variables, ports, parameters, functions, tasks, types.  See for instance
@(see vl-vardecl), @(see vl-port) and @(see vl-portdecl), @(see vl-paramdecl),
@(see vl-fundecl), @(see vl-taskdecl), and @(see vl-typedef).</li>

<li>Underpinning all of the above are <b><see topic='@(url
expressions-and-datatypes)'>Expressions and Datatypes</see></b>.  These are
mutually recursive since expressions like casts can include types while many
datatypes use expressions for indexes and so forth.</li>

<li>Various constructs like always/initial/final blocks and functions and tasks
also make use of <b>procedural @(see statements)</b> like if/else, case
statements, and for loops.  Some notable statements include @(see
vl-assertstmt) and @(see vl-cassertstmt) for immediate and concurrent
SystemVerilog assertions.  Note that concurrent assertions also involve an
elaborate notion of @(see property-expressions).</li>

</ul>

<p>The above isn't entirely comprehensive; for instance a good deal of stuff is
needed to represent generate statements; see @(see vl-genelement).  There are
also various unfinished areas like support for SystemVerilog assertions.</p>")

<p>It is important to understand the difference between ports and port
declarations.  We represent ports as @('vl-port') structures, whereas port
declarations re represented as @(see vl-portdecl) structures.  It is easy to
see the difference between ports and port declarations when modules are
declared using the \"non-ANSI\" syntax.</p>

@({
module mod(a,b,c) ;  <-- ports

  input [3:0] a;     <-- port declarations (not ports)
  input b;
  output c;
endmodule
})

<p>It is less easy to see this difference when the more concise \"ANSI\" syntax
is used:</p>

@({
module mod(
  input [3:0] a;   <-- ports and port declarations, mixed together
  input b;
  output c;
) ;
   ...
endmodule
})

<p>Regardless of which syntax is used, VL internally creates both ports and
portdecls as separate structures.</p>

<p>In most designs, there is a single port corresponding to each port
declaration.  However, in general Verilog permits more complex ports.  Here is
an example of a module where the ports have external names that are distinct
from their internal wiring.</p>

@({
module mod (a, .b(w), c[3:0], .d(c[7:4])) ;
  input a;
  input w;
  input [7:0] c;
  ...
endmodule
})

<p>In this example, the @('name')s of these ports would be, respectively:
@('\"a\"'), @('\"b\"'), @('nil') (because the third port has no externally
visible name), and @('\"d\"').  Meanwhile, the first two ports are internally
wired to @('a') and @('w'), respectively, while the third and fourth ports
collectively specify the bits of @('c').</p>

<p>SystemVerilog-2012 extends ports in several ways, but most of these
extensions (e.g., support for fancy data types) are related to the port
declarations rather than the ports.  One place where the ports themselves
<i>are</i> extended is for interface ports.  See @(see vl-port).</p>")

(deftranssum vl-port
  (vl-regularport
   vl-interfaceport)
  :short "Representation of a single port."
  :long "<p>Most ports are regular ports, see @(see vl-regularport).  However,
SystemVerilog also adds interface ports, see @(see vl-interfaceport).</p>

<p>It is generally best to <b>avoid using port names</b> except perhaps for
things like error messages.  Why?  As shown above, some ports might not have
names, and even when a port does have a name, it does not necessarily
correspond to any wires in the module.  Since these cases are exotic, code that
is based on port names is likely to work for simple test cases, but then fail
later when more complex examples are encountered!</p>

<p>Usually you should not need to deal with port names.  The @(see argresolve)
transform converts module instances that use named arguments into their plain
equivalents, and once this has been done there really isn't much reason to have
port names anymore.  Instead, you can work directly with the port's
expression.</p>

<p>Our @('vl-port-p') structures do not restrict the kinds of expressions that
may be used as the internal wiring, but we generally expect that each such
expression should satisfy @(see vl-portexpr-p).</p>

<p>A \"blank\" port expression (represented by @('nil')) means the port is not
connected to any wires within the module.  Our @(see argresolve) transform will
issue non-fatal @(see warnings) if any non-blank arguments are connected to
blank ports, or if blank arguments are connected to non-blank ports.  It is
usually not hard to support blank ports in other transformations.</p>

<p>The direction of a port can most safely be obtained by @(see
vl-port-direction).  Note that directions are not particularly reliable in
Verilog: one can assign to a input or read from an output, and in simulators
like Cadence this can actually impact values on wires in the supermodule as if
the ports have no buffers.  We call this \"backflow.\" <b>BOZO</b> eventually
implement a comprehensive approach to detecting and dealing with backflow.</p>

<p>The width of a port can be determined after expression sizing has been
performed by examining the width of the port expression.  See @(see
expression-sizing) for details.</p>")

  wire w2;
  assign w2 = w1;       // <-- continuous assignment
endmodule

<p>Regardless of which form is used, the @(see parser) generates a
@('vl-assign-p') object.  Note that the following is also legal Verilog:</p>

@({
  assign foo = 1, bar = 2;
})

<p>But in such cases, the parser will create two @('vl-assign-p') objects, one
to represent the assignment to @('foo'), and the other to represent the
assignment to @('bar').  Hence, each @('vl-assign-p') represents only a single
assignment.</p>


<h4>Lvalue</h4>

<p>The @('lvalue') field must be an expression, and represents the location
being assigned to.  The formal syntax definition for Verilog only permits
lvalues to be:</p>

<ul>
 <li>identifiers,</li>
 <li>bit- or part-selects, and</li>
 <li>concatenations of the above.</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, from Table 6.1, (p. 68), we find that only @('net')
declarations are permitted in continuous assignments; @('reg')s, @('integer')s,
and other variables must be assigned only using procedural assignments.  We
have experimentally verified (see @('test-assign.v')) that Cadence enforces
these rules.</p>

<p>Our parser does impose these syntactic restrictions, but in @('vl-assign-p')
we are perhaps overly permissive, and we only require that the @('lvalue') is
an expression.  Even so, some transforms may cause fatal warnings if these
semantic restrictions are violated, so one must be careful when generating
assignments.</p>

<h4>Expr</h4>

<p>The @('expr') is the expression being assigned to this lvalue.  We do not in
any way restrict the expression, nor have we found any restrictions discussed
in the Verilog-2005 standard.  Even so, it seems there must be some limits.
For instance, what does it mean to assign, say, a minimum/typical/maximum delay
expression?  For these sorts of reasons, some transforms may wish to only
permit a subset of all expressions here.</p>


<h4>Delay</h4>

<p>The @('delay') for a continuous assignment is discussed in 6.1.3 (page 71),
and specifies how long it takes for a change in the value of the right-hand
side to be propagated into the lvalue.  We represent the delay using a @(see
vl-maybe-gatedelay-p); if the @('delay') is @('nil'), it means that no delay
was specified.</p>

<p>Note (6.1.3) that when delays are provided in the combined declaration and
assignment statement, e.g., </p>

@({
  wire #10 a = 1, b = 2;
})

<p>that the delay is to be associated with each assignment, and NOT with the
net declaration for @('a').  Net delays are different than assignment delays;
see @(see vl-vardecl) for additional discussion.</p>

<p><b>Warning:</b> Although the parser is careful to handle the delay
correctly, we are generally uninterested in delays and our transforms may not
properly preserve them.</p>

<p><b>BOZO</b> Presumably the default delay is zero?  Haven't seen that yet,
though.</p>

<h4>Strength</h4>

<p>Strengths on continuous assignments are discussed in 6.1.4.  We represent
the strength using a @(see vl-maybe-gatestrength-p).  If a strength is not
provided, the parser sets this to @('nil').</p>

correctly, we are generally uninterested in strengths and our transforms may not
properly preserve them.</p>")

         certain properties.  Some of these properties, like its dimension(s)
         and whether it is regarded as signed, are captured by the notion of a
         SystemVerilog <b>variable type</b> or <b>data type</b>.  We represent
         this information as an ordinary @(see vl-datatype), found in the
         @('type') field of the @('vl-vardecl').</p>

         <p>The main difference between nets and datatypes is that nets can be
         used with multiple drivers.  To support resolving multiple drivers in
         different ways, net declarations can include a <b>net type</b> such as
         @('wire') for plain wires, @('wor') for a wired or, @('supply0') for a
         <i>ground</i> wire, and similar.  Despite its name, the ``net type''
         has nothing to do with the ordinary notion of a data type!  (This
         terminology, unfortunately, comes from the Verilog/SystemVerilog
         standards; see for instance SystemVerilog-2012 section 6.5).</p>

         <p>Here are some examples of basic net declarations.</p>

         @({
             module m (a, b, c) ;
               wire [4:0] w ;       // <-- plain net declaration
               wire ab = a & b ;    // <-- net declaration with assignment
               ...
             endmodule
         })

         <p>Net declarations can also arise from using the combined form of
         port declarations.</p>

         @({
             module m (a, b, c) ;
               input wire a;    // <-- net declaration in a port declaration
               ...
             endmodule
         })

         <p>They can also arise from the more modern ANSI style ports, e.g.,</p>

         @({
             module m (input wire a, ...) ;
         })

         <p>You can also string together net declarations, e.g., by writing
         @('wire w1, w2;').  In all of these cases, our @(see parser) generates
         a separate @('vl-vardecl-p') object for each declared wire.  When an
         assignment is also present, the parser creates a corresponding,
         separate @(see vl-assign-p) object to contain the assignment.  Hence,
         each @('vl-vardecl-p') really and truly only represents a single
         declaration.  Similarly, combined variable declarations such as
         \"integer a, b\" are split apart into multiple, individual
         declarations.</p>")

  :long "<p>Both Verilog-2005 and SystemVerilog-2012 allow parameters to be
declared without any explicit type information, e.g., one can write:</p>

@({
    parameter size = 5;          <-- no explicit type, signedness, or range
    parameter signed foo = -1;   <-- explicitly signed, no explicit range
    parameter [3:0] bar = 2;     <-- explicitly 4 bits, no explicit signedness
})

<p>The ultimate, post-elaboration type and range of these parameters are
described in Verilog-2005 Section 12.2 and in SystemVerilog-2012 sections
6.20.2 and 23.10.  These rules are exotic.  When no explicit type/range is
given, the final type/range is taken from whatever value is ultimately assigned
to the parameter.  In other cases, i.e., there is only a signedness but no
explicit range, or vice versa, then some aspects of the final type/range are
determined by the value assigned to the parameter, and other aspects are
governed by the parameter declaration itself.</p>

<p>A consequence of these weird rules is that we cannot simply assign some
default type to plain parameter declarations.  Instead, we need to know that
the parameter doesn't have parts of its type specified.  To accommodate this,
we use @(see vl-implicitvalueparam) structures when the type of a parameter is
implicitly specified, or @(see vl-explicitvalueparam) structures for parameters
with explicitly specified types.</p>

<p>All of the above parameters are <b>value parameters</b>.  In Verilog-2005,
all parameters are value parameters.  However, in SystemVerilog-2012, it is
also possible to have type parameters (See Section 6.20.3), e.g.,</p>

@({
    parameter type bus_t = logic [31:0];
})

<p>Type parameters are quite different from value parameters.  We represent
their types as @(see vl-typeparam)s.</p>"

     :long "<p>Assignment statements are covered in Section 9.2.  There are two
            major types of assignment statements.</p>

            <h4>Procedural Assignments</h4>

            <p>Procedural assignment statements may only be used to assign to
            @('reg'), @('integer'), @('time'), @('realtime'), and memory data
            types, and cannot be used to assign to ordinary nets such as
            @('wire')s.  There are two kinds of procedural assignments: </p>

            @({
               foo = bar ;     // \"blocking\" -- do the assignment now
               foo <= bar ;    // \"nonblocking\" -- schedule the assignment to occur
            })

            <p>The difference between these two statements has to do with
            Verilog's timing model and simulation semantics.  In particular, a
            blocking assignment \"executes before the statements that follow
            it,\" whereas a non-blocking assignment only \"schedules\" an
            assignment to occur and can be thought of as executing in parallel
            with what follows it.</p>

            <h4>Continuous Procedural Assignments</h4>

            <p>Continuous procedural assignment statements may apparently be
            used to assign to either nets or variables.  There are two
            kinds:</p>

            @({
              assign foo = bar ;  // only for variables
              force foo = bar ;   // for variables or nets
            })

            <p>We represent all of these kinds of assignment statements
            uniformly as @('vl-assignstmt-p') objects.</p>

            <h4>SystemVerilog Extensions</h4>

            <p>SystemVerilog-2012 implements special additional assignment
            operators such as @('a += b').  Per Section 11.4 of
            SystemVerilog-2012, these operators are semantically equivalent to
            blocking assignment statements except that in the case of index
            expressions such as @('a[i] += b'), the index @('i') is only
            evaluated once.  VL's parser converts assignments such as @('a +=
            b') into blocking assignments such as @('a = a + b').  To note that
            this was a @('+=') style assignment, the parser adds a
            @('VL_FANCY_ASSIGNMENT_OPERATOR') attribute to the assignstmt.</p>

            <p>SystemVerilog also adds increment and decrement operators, i.e.,
            @('a++') and @('a--').  These operators, per Section 11.4.2 of
            SystemVerilog-2012, also \"behave as blocking assignments.\" We
            normally convert these operators into blocking assignments in the
            @(see increment-elim) transform.</p>")

            declarations even in unnamed blocks.</p>

            <p>SystemVerilog also allows the label to occur before the
            @('begin') or @('fork') keyword, and, more generally, allows labels
            to be added to other kinds of statements.  For instance, you can
            write:</p>

            @({
                 update_foo: foo = foo + bar;
            })

            <p>We turn labels like this into named begin/end blocks that
            surround their statement.</p>

            <p>Note that it's not legal to label a block both before and after
            the begin keyword.  See SystemVerilog-2012 Section 9.3.5, Statement
            Labels, on page 178.</p>

            <p>SystemVerilog also adds different kinds of @('join') keywords,
            which we now represent as part of the block's type.</p>")

<p>The reason we have these: Parsing ports is fairly ambiguous and there's a
lot that needs to be fleshed out after we have a fuller picture of the design.
The worst ambiguity is that there's no syntactic difference in an ANSI portlist

it doesn't have an explicit direction, nettype, or @('var') keyword).  The only
way to resolve these is to determine whether the interface/type name actually
refers to an interface or a type.</p>

<p>Another issue, with non-ANSI ports, is that a port declaration may have a
corresponding net/variable declaration that contains different information
about its type and nettype.  We resolve this later as well, cross-propagating
the type information between the variable and port declarations.</p>"

<p>This is probably mostly outdated.  It was originally intended for use in
@(see vl2014::primitives).  The Verilog definitions of these modules sometimes
make use of fancy Verilog constructs.  Normally our transforms would try to
remove these constructs, replacing them with instances of primitives.  This can
lead to funny sorts of problems if we try to transform the primitives
themselves.</p>

<p>For instance, consider the @(see vl2014::*vl-1-bit-delay-1*) module.  This
module has a delayed assignment, @('assign #1 out = in').  If we hit this
module with the @(see vl2014::delayredux) transform, we'll try to replace the
delay with an explicit instance of @('VL_1_BIT_DELAY_1').  But that's crazy:
now the module is trying to instantiate itself!</p>

<p>Similar issues can arise from trying to replace the @('always') statements
in a primitive flop/latch with instances of flop/latch primitives, etc.  So as
a general rule, we mark the primitives with @('VL_HANDS_OFF') and code our
transforms to not modules with this attribute.</p>"
