  :long "<p>Our initial approach to pretty-printing with comments was to store
all comments in a single comment map, then extract the relevant part of the
comment map when we wanted to print each module.  But profiling indicated that
we were spending 90% of the (considerable) pretty-printing time just gathering
the appropriate comments.</p>

<p>We then decided to attach the comments to each module, once and for all, so
that we never need to look them up during pretty printing.  An advantage of
this is that we can carry out the comment injection before unparameterization,
so that there are fewer lookups to begin with.  Another advantage is that we
can do the comment injection after loading each file, so that we never need to
build a massive comment map spanning all files, but only smaller ones on a
per-file basis.</p>

<p>Even so, individual files can be large.  For a half-million line file, we
obtained a big comment map, and our simple-minded comment gathering scheme was
taking around 20 seconds.  We developed a faster version that threw away
comments after assigning them to a module, but even this was taking 10 seconds
and allocating 1 GB of memory.</p>

<p>To correct for this, we developed a much faster comment gathering mechanism.
The basic idea is to partition the big comment map into an alist that maps each
line number to the subset of the comment map which is about that line.</p>

<p>That is, each entry in our commentmap-fal has the form:</p>

@({
 line --> comment-map
})

<p>where the @('comment-map') has only the comments for this line and, in
practice, is typically a singleton.</p>

<p>To extract all of the comments, we simply walk over the lines between min
and max, gathering their comments.</p>"

<p>This is especially common when modules are written in separate files, and
the comments describing the module are found at the top.  Unfortunately, our
basic approach to comment gathering&mdash;associating all comments between
@('module') and @('endmodule')&mdash;misses these comments.</p>

<p>To correct for this, we no longer use the actual @('minloc') for the module.
Instead, we (almost) choose the largest @('maxloc') of any <i>other</i> module
such that @('other-maxloc < minloc').  That sounds like gibberish but it makes
sense if you just draw what portion of the file you want:</p>

<p>Well, we don't <i>quite</i> use the maxloc of the previous module.  Instead,
we use <i>maxloc+1</i>.  The reason for this is that sometimes people put in
really stupid comments after @('end') keywords, such as:</p>

@({
    module foo (...);

        ;; Subtle.  We sort all the comments.  This sorting isn't useful for
        ;; the comment-injection algorithm, but is only meant to remove
        ;; duplicates.
        ;;
        ;; You might wonder: why in the world would there be duplicate entries
        ;; in the comment map?  After all, it's an alist that binds locations
        ;; to strings.  So wouldn't there only be duplicates if we've read the
        ;; same lines of code multiple times?  Yes.  So why would we be doing
        ;; that???
        ;;
        ;; The problem is that files can be `included in multiple places.
        ;;
        ;; Recall how `include works: when we encounter `include "foo_if.sv",
        ;; we are to grab the entire contents of foo_if.sv and essentially
        ;; paste them down into the superior file.  This is an extremely dumb
        ;; process that doesn't, e.g., remember what files it has already
        ;; loaded.  Because of this, a widely `included "header" file ends up
        ;; getting replicated every time it is used.
        ;;
        ;; Normally, such header files will have "include guards" to ensure
        ;; that the real contents of such a header are only really included
        ;; into the design once.  For instance, a typical header might look
        ;; like this:
        ;;
        ;;    // foo_if.sv
        ;;    // Copyright (C) 2014 Centaur Technology
        ;;    // ... more copyright information, authorship, etc ...
        ;;
        ;;    `ifndef INCLUDED_FOO_INTERFACE
        ;;    `define INCLUDED_FOO_INTERFACE
        ;;
        ;;    interface foo ...
        ;;      ...
        ;;    endinterface
        ;;
        ;;    `endif
        ;;
        ;; The `ifndef stuff ensures that the actual definition of "foo" will
        ;; not be replicated.  However, since the copyright comments here are
        ;; not put underneath the include guard, they are essentially going to
        ;; be replicated every time that this header is included!
        ;;
        ;; So, to deal with this kind of replication, we sort the comments to
        ;; remove the duplicates before attaching them to their associated
        ;; modules, etc.

; BOZO we currently leave some comments unaccounted for.  For instance,
; consider something like:
;
;    module foo ... endmodule
;
;    // comment about the import
;    import mypkg::name;
;
;    // comment about bar
;    module bar ... endmodule
;
; Here we'll get the comment about bar and associate it with bar.  However,
; since imports don't have comments, the comment about the import will be lost.
; Some day we might try to gather these comments and stick them in the design.
; For now, well, we used to skip ALL comments between modules, so we're still
; working pretty hard to do something reasonably sensible.
