(defxdoc preprocessor
  :parents (loader)
  :short "Limited preprocessor for Verilog."

  :long "<p>First, a warning.  In general, the Verilog specification does not
cover how preprocessing is to be done in a very complete way.  We are left with
many subtle questions about how the preprocessor should behave, and to resolve
these questions we have sometimes just given test cases to simulators such as
Verilog-XL, NCVerilog, and VCS.  This is not a very satisfying state of
affairs.</p>

<h4>Supported Directives</h4>

<p>Our preprocessor has pretty good support for the @('define')- and
@('ifdef')-related directives:</p>

<ul>
 <li>define</li>
 <li>ifdef</li>
 <li>ifndef</li>
 <li>elsif</li>
 <li>else</li>
 <li>undef</li>
</ul>

<p>We place some (reasonable) restrictions on the above macros.  For instance,
we do not allow definitions to include most compiler directives&mdash;we allow
the body of @('`foo') to include @('`bar'), but not @('`endif').  These
restrictions are intended to ensure that we do not \"mispreprocess\" anything.
See @(see preprocessor-ifdef-minutia) for some details and additional
discussion.</p>

<p>We also have pretty good support for @('`include') directives.  This is
quite underspecified, and we have basically tried to mimic the behavior of
Verilog-XL and NCVerilog.  See also @(see preprocessor-include-minutia).</p>

<p>We also support @('`__FILE__') and @('`__LINE__') directives.</p>

<h4>Ignored Directives</h4>

<p>We also \"support\" certain directives by <b>ignoring</b> them.</p>

<ul>
 <li>@('`celldefine')</li>
 <li>@('`endcelldefine')</li>
 <li>@('`resetall')</li>
 <li>@('`timescale')</li>
 <li>@('`protect')</li>
 <li>@('`endprotect')</li>
</ul>

<p>When we say we ignore these directives, we mean that the preprocessor
literally removes them from the source code that the lexer sees.  No record of
these directives is ever kept.  A consequence of this is, upon having loaded
some VL modules, there is not really any way to know whether these directives
were included anywhere in the source code.</p>

<p>In the case of @('celldefine') and @('endcelldefine'), this seems pretty
reasonable.  It seems that these directives only mark modules as \"cells\" for
certain PLI directives or other tools.  None of the tools we are developing
care about this, so for now we just ignore this directive.</p>

<p>The @('resetall') directive is tool dependent and it seems valid to ignore
it entirely.  We do not try to enforce the restriction that @('resetall') must
not occur within a module definition.</p>

<p>We also ignore @('timescale') directives.  This is not ideal, but is pretty
reasonable for things like ESIM where timing is irrelevant.  It is also fairly
reasonable even for something like a transistor analyzer that cares about unit
delays, as long as differnet timescales are not being mixed together.  (Mixing
timescales within a single design seems insane, and after all what is the
\"default\" timescale supposed to be?  BOZO maybe add a warning if more than
one kind of timescale is seen.</p>

<p>We also ignore @('`protect') and @('`endprotect'), which seem to be old
Verilog-XL directives for marking code that you want a tool to encrypt.  VL
doesn't implement any support for decrypting protected code, but it can at
least ignore these indications that you want to encrypt something.  Note that
these directives are not documented in the SystemVerilog-2012 standard and are
probably subsumed by the @('pragma') syntax described in Section 34, protected
envelopes.</p>

<p>As future work, there might be some benefit to somehow preserving these
directives so that they can be printed out again in the simplified Verilog we
produce.  That is, maybe it would make the simplified Verilog easier to use as
a \"drop-in replacement\" for the unsimplified Verilog.</p>


<h4>Unsupported Directives</h4>

<p>We currently make no attempt to support:</p>

<ul>
 <li>@('`begin_keywords')</li>
 <li>@('`default_nettype')</li>
 <li>@('`end_keywords')</li>
 <li>@('`line')</li>
 <li>@('`pragma')</li>
 <li>@('`nounconnected_drive')</li>
 <li>@('`unconnected_drive')</li>
</ul>

<p>It might be good to ignore @('`begin_keywords \"1364-2005\"') and just cause
an error if a different set of keywords is requested.  We could also ignore
@('`end_keywords').  But trying to add anything more sophisticated than this
seems very tricky and messy.</p>

<p>It would be good to add proper support for @('`line').  Failing that, it
would be quite easy to just ignore it, like the other ignored directives.  We
should probably also ignore @('`pragma') directives, and this should be easy to
do.</p>

<p>It would be somewhat difficult to support @('`default_nettype') and
@('`unconnected_drive').  Probably the thing to do would be build a table of
when the declarations are made, and then use some trick like comment injection
to mark modules appropriately.  We would then have to change the @(see
make-implicit-wires) transform to consider the @('`default_nettype') for the
module, and probably use a separate transform to handle @('`unconnected_drive')
stuff.</p>")

(defxdoc preprocessor-ifdef-minutia
  :short "Subtle notes about or @('`define') and @('`ifdef') handling."

  :long "<p>There are many subtleties related to @('`define') and @('`ifdef')
that make my head hurt.</p>

<p><b>BOZO</b> most of my testing was done on Verilog-XL before I really knew
much about NCVerilog.  It would be good to double-check all of these things on
NCVerilog and make sure it behaves the same.</p>


<h5>Define is Lazy</h5>

<p>An important thing to realize is that the text which follows \"@('`define
foo')\" is not preprocessed once when it is read.  Instead, it is separately
preprocessed each time `foo is encountered.  Hence, upon running</p>

@({
`define foo 3
`define bar `foo
`undef foo
`define foo 4
})

<p>the value of `bar will be 4.</p>


<h5>Includes are not followed if they are @('ifdef')ed away.</h5>

<p>On both Verilog-XL and NCVerilog, it appears that an @('`include')
directives within @('ifdef')-ed away blocks are NOT expanded.  An easy way to
test this is by writing a file called @('endif.v') which simply contains:</p>

@({
`endif
})

<p>Then we can do things like this:</p>

@({
`define foo
`ifdef foo
  `include \"endif.v\"
// the `ifdef has now ended
})

<p>And this:</p>

@({
// suppose bar is undefined
`ifdef bar
  `include \"endif.v\"
  // the `ifdef has not ended yet, so the include is not expanded
`endif
})

<p>We think this is pretty reasonable so we mimic this behavior.</p>


<h5>We Prohibit Certain Directives In Defines</h5>

<p>In Verilog-XL, @('`define') can interact with the @('`ifdef') tree in subtle
ways.  For instance, Verilog-XL accepts the following input:</p>

@({
`define condition 1
`define myendif `endif
`ifdef condition
   assign w1 = 1 ;
`myendif
})

<p>Yet when @('`foo') is used inside of an ifdef'd-away section, it is not
expanded.  And so, the above example becomes a parse error if you merely remove
the @('`define condition 1') line.</p>

<p>Another subtlety.  As expected, defines found within ifdefed-away parts of
the code have no effect.  For example, if not_defined is not defined, then upon
running</p>

@({
`define foo 3
`ifdef not_defined
   `define foo 4
`endif
})

<p>the value of @('`foo') will correctly be 3.  Similarly, writing @('`undef
foo') in the not_defined block does not actually undefine foo.  But the
preprocessor is not mindlessly skipping text until an `else or `elseif is
encountered.  For example, the following is well-formed and does not result in
a too-many-endifs warning.</p>

@({
`ifdef not_defined
   `define myendif `endif
`endif
})

<p>This is insane, so we prohibit things like @('`define myendif `endif') by
disallowing the use of built-in directives in macro text.  Note that we still
permit the use of @('`define foo `bar'), with the same lazy semantics that
Verilog-XL uses.</p>


<h5>We Prohibit Defining or Testing Built-in Directive Names</h5>

<p>We do not allow compiler directive names to be @('`define')d, or to be used
within @('ifdef'), @('ifndef'), or @('elsif') directives.  Why is this?</p>

<p>Note that macro names can be simple or escaped identifiers.  In Section
3.7.1, we are told that the leading backslash character and trailing whitespace
are not considered part of an escaped identifier, and that the escaped
identifier @('\\cpu3') is to be treated the same as @('cpu3').  Indeed, in
Verilog-XL we find that the following works as expected:</p>

@({
`define foo 3
`define \\bar 4

assign w1 = `foo ;
assign w2 = `\\foo ;
assign w3 = `bar ;
assign w4 = '\\bar ;
})

<p>In Section 19.3.1, we are told that all compiler directives shall be
considered predefined macro names, and it shall be illegal to redefine a
compiler directive as a macro name.  And Verilog-XL seems to rightfully complain
about things like:</p>

@({
`define define 5
`define ifdef 6
})

<p>And yet, Verilog-XL permits the following:</p>

@({
`define \\define 5
`define \\ifdef 6

assign w1 = `\\define ;
assign w2 = `\\ifdef ;
})

<p>While the following will be errors:</p>

@({
assign w3 = `define ;
assign w4 = `ifdef ;
})

<p>Should @('\\define') be treated differently from @('define')?  Maybe.  After
all, the point of escaped identifiers is probably to not clash with regular
keywords.  But on the other hand, if the predefined names are to be considered
predefined, then shouldn't things like this</p>

@({
`ifdef define
})

<p>always evaluate to true?  But in Verilog-XL this is false unless you have
done a @('`define \\define') like above.  Verilog-XL also does not complain
about @('`undef') define, which seems strange.</p>

<p>At any rate, to entirely avoid the question of what the right behavior is
here, we simply prohibit the use of compiler directives, whether escaped or
not, as names anywhere in @('defines'), @('undefs'), @('ifdefs'), @('ifndefs'),
and @('elsifs').  In practice this only prevents people from writing things
like @('`define define') and @('`ifdef undef'), anyway, so this should not be
too controversial.</p>


<h5>We make certain restrictions to disambiguate line continuations and
comments.</h5>

<p>From 19.3.1, the macro text for a define is:</p>

<ul>
 <li>any arbitrary text specified on the same line as the macro name,</li>

 <li>except that the sequence @('\\<newline>') may be used to extend the macro
     text across multiple lines,</li>

 <li>and single-line comments are not to become part of the substituted
     text.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the surface, this is straightforward enough.  But it is difficult to know
exactly how comments and these line continuations are supposed to interact.
And Verilog-XL, in particular, has some very strange and seemingly inconsistent
rules:</p>

@({
`define foo 5 \// comment             (accepted)
         'h4

`define foo 5 // comment \\           (rejected)
         'h4

`define foo 5 \\/* comment */         (rejected)
         'h4

`define foo 5 /* comment \\           (accepted)
      */ 'h4

`define foo 5 /* comment              (rejected)
      */ 'h4
})

<p>To prevent any amiguity, we prohibit any combination of comments and
continuations that seems difficult to understand.  In particular, we impose the
following \"cowardly\" restrictions on macro text:</p>

<ol>

<li>Single-line comments are not allowed to end with @('\\')</li>

<li>Block comments are not allowed to contain newlines</li>

<li>The sequences @('\\//') and @('\\/*') are not allowed except within
comments, string literals, and escaped identifiers</li>

</ol>

<p>These constriants make reading until the end of the macro text fairly
complicated since we cannot stupidly read the text without interpreting it;
rather we have to look for string literals, comments, escaped identifiers, etc.
The goal is for everything we support will be interpreted in the same way by
Verilog-XL and other tools.</p>")

   (some-thing-satisfiedp booleanp :rule-classes :type-prescription)
   (already-saw-elsep     booleanp :rule-classes :type-prescription))

  :long "<p>Iframes (\"ifdef frames\") are essential in our approach to
handling @('`ifdef') directives.  Our main preprocessing function, @(see
vl-preprocess-loop), takes three arguments that have to do with handling
ifdefs:</p>

<ul>

<li>@('defines') is the current @(see vl-defines-p) alist.  For now, just
assume that we are able to appropriately keep this list updated as we encounter
defines and undefs.</li>

<li>@('activep') is a boolean which is true whenever the characters are are now
reading from the file ought to be given to the lexer -- the idea is that when
we encounter an @('`ifdef') whose condition isn't satisfied, we turn off
@('activep') until the closing @('`endif') is encountered.</li>

<li>@('istack') is a stack of @('vl-iframe-p') objects which explain how to
manage @('activep') as we descend through a nest of @('`ifdef'), @('`ifndef'),
@('`elsif'), @('`else'), and @('`endif') directives.</li>

</ul>

<p>Let us temporarily ignore nested directives.  Then, our task would be to
decide when activep should be turned on during sequences like this:</p>

@({
    `if[n]def THING
      stuff1
    `elsif THING2
      stuff2
    `elsif THING3
      stuff3
    `else
      stuff4
    `endif
})

<p>The semantics of this (Section 19.4) are essentially: figure out the first
<i>THING</i> that is satisfied, include its stuff, and ignore the rest.  So for
instance, if <i>THING2</i> and <i>THING3</i> are both satisfied, we still only
want to include <i>stuff2</i> since it comes first.</p>

<p>To implement this, the basic idea is that when we encounter an @('`ifdef')
or @('`ifndef') directive, we construct an iframe that helps us set
@('activep') correctly.  The first two fields of the iframe are:</p>

<dl>

<dt>@('some-thing-satisfiedp')</dt>

<dd>which indicates if any of the <i>THING</i>s we have seen so far was
satisfied, and</dd>

<dt>@('already-saw-elsep')</dt>

<dd>which indicates whether we have seen an @('`else') and is used only as a
sanity check to prevent multiple @('`else') clauses.</dd>

</dl>

<p>And as we descend through the above sequences, we update the iframe and
ensure that @('activep') is set exactly when the current <i>THING</i> is
satisfied and no previous <i>THING</i> was satisfied.</p>

<p>But the story is not quite complete yet, because we also have to handle
nested ifdefs.  For example, imagine we have:</p>

@({
   `ifdef OUTER
     ...
     `ifdef INNER_THING1
       stuff1
     `elsif INNER2_THING2
       stuff2
     `else
       stuff3
     `endif
     ...
   `endif
})

<p>This is almost the same, except that now we only want to turn on
@('activep') when <i>OUTER</i> is also satisfied.  To keep track of this, we
add another field to our iframe objects:</p>

<dl>

<dt>@('initially-activep')</dt>

<dd>which indicates whether @('activep') was set when we encountered the
@('`ifdef') or @('ifndef') for this iframe.</dd>

</dl>

<p>Now, @('activep') should be enabled exactly when:</p>

<ul>

<li>(inner criteria): the current <i>THING</i> is satisfied and no previous
<i>THING</i> was sastified, and</li>

<li>(outer-criteria): @('initially-activep') was also set, i.e., this chunk of
code is not being blocked by some <i>THING</i> in an outer @('ifdef')
tree.</li>

</ul>")

; A line continuation.
;
; Ugh.  I found a stupid bug here on 2011-04-26 because I was recurring on (cdr
; echars) instead of (cddr echars).
;
; Then I did some more tests.  This is really horrible.  In particular, what
; should \<newline> expand to?  Some plausible answers would include at least:
; nothing, a newline, or a single space.
;
; Theory 1 (my first theory): the sequence \<newline> should just expand into a
; newline character.
;
; Experiment to try to disprove Theory 2 (cosims/pp3): Verilog-XL, NCV, and VCS
; say that `goo is 3 in the following:
;
;   |`define foo 1 \<newline>
;   |  + 2
;   |`define goo `foo
;
; After seeing this, I originally thought that it disproved Theory 1, because
; if \<newline> expanded to just a <newline>, then wouldn't that mean that
; after expanding `foo the above would be equivalent to:
;
;   |`define goo 1
;   |  + 2
;
; And wouldn't this mean that `goo would be defined as 1?  But I no longer
; think this is the case.  Instead, I think all we're seeing here is that
; `define expansion is lazy: `goo just expands to `foo, which then expands to 1
; [whatever \<newline> expands to] + 2.  So the experiment is just not very
; useful.  For further verification that `define is lazy, see cosims/pp5.
;
; New experiment (cosims/pp4) to try to rule out \<newline> expanding into
; nothing at all.  Notice the left column here.
;
;  |`define test module\<newline>
;  |mytest
;  |
;  |`test () ;
;  |endmodule
;
; NCVerilog and VCS both accept this, which suggests that \<newline> expands to
; at least a space or newline or some other kind of whitespace.  Verilog-XL
; said this was a syntax error, even when I added a space before the module's
; name, e.g.,
;
;  |`define `test module\<newline>
;  | test
;
; But it was happy when I put a space before the \<newline>.  So, it doesn't
; seem like Verilog-XL tolerates \ continuations without a space before them,
; meaning that whether it expands to a space or nothing is irrelevant.
;
; For many years, I had \<newline> expand into a space character and I thought
; that was the right story.  But later, when I relaxed VL's restrictions that
; `defines must not contain directives like `ifdef, `define, etc., I found that
; this did not seem to be correct.  In particular, consider:
;
; Experiment 3 (cosims/pp2):
;
;    |`define HORRIBLE \<newline>
;    |  `define FOO \<newline>
;    |  1'b1<newline>
;
; If \<newline> expands to a space, then this should be equivalent to:
;
;    |`define HORRIBLE `define FOO 1'b1
;
; But both NCV and VCS seem to interpret this differently.  In particular,
; constructs such as
;
;   generate
;     if (`HORRIBLE) ...
;   endgenerate
;
; Are tolerated, and afterward `FOO seems to be `define'd to be 1.  I think
; the most plausible explanation is that \<newline> expands to a newline
; character.

@({

     list_of_actual_arguments ::= actual_argument { ',' actual_argument }

     actual_argument ::= expression
})

<p>But this last part is clearly total bullshit.  For instance on page 643 we
are told:</p>

<blockquote>\"However, one can define an empty text macro, say @('`EMPTY'), and
use that as an actual argument.  This will be substituted in place of the
formal argument and will be replaced by empty text after expansion of the empty
text macro.\"</blockquote>

<p>It seems very clear that the empty string is not an expression.  Moreover,
all of this discussion of the preprocessor seems quite deeply rooted in a
notion of textual substitution.  Accordingly, the idea that
@('actual_argument ::= expression') seems to be very much confusing different
levels of representation (e.g., expressions versus text) and just cannot be
correct at all.</p>

<p>That's a bummer because we need to allow <i>something</i> to occur in these
actuals, and that something could be some rather complicated piece of text.
Interestingly, both NCVerilog and VCS permit uses of macros such as:</p>

@({
   `define identity(a) a
   module foo;
     `identity(reg foo;)
   endmodule
})

<p>However they complain about too many macro arguments on examples such as:</p>

@({
    `identity(reg bar, baz;)
})

<p>Meanwhile they happily accept syntax such as:</p>

@({
    `identity(2 + {1'b0, 1'b1})
})

<p>On Page 641 of the spec, we find some hints about what might be permitted
here:</p>

<blockquote>\"Actual arguments and defaults shall not contain comma or right
parenthesis characters outside matched pairs of left and right parentheses
@('()'), square brackets @('[]'), braces @('{}'), double quotes @('\"'), or an
escaped identifier.\"</blockquote>

<p>This paragraph seems to suggest a kind of algorithm for deciding where the
actual text ends, roughly: keep track of matched pairs of these special
characters, be smart enough to recognize strings and escaped identifiers, and
stop when you see a comma or right parenthesis.</p>

<p>I implement such an algorithm here, but of course there is a great deal of
room for ambiguity and confusion here, so this may well not be at all correct.
The system tests (centaur/vl/systest) do try to test some tricky cases, but
there may well be mismatches left.</p>"

  :long "<p>The Verilog spec is very vague about how @('include') directives
are to be processed.</p>

<p>It does nicely explain that we are to simply replace the @('`include
\"foo.v\"') directive with the entire contents of @('foo.b'), and explains some
things related to the syntax of the directive.  It also says that the included
file can itself contain @('include') directives, which of course seems
perfectly reasonable.</p>

<p>The spec explicitly says the filename can be an absolute or relative
pathname.  In the case of an absolute pathname, the intention seems pretty
clear.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the spec does <b>not</b> explain anything about what a
relative path is relative to.  Upon reading the spec, I thought, \"well,
<i>obviously</i> it means relative to whatever file is currently being
processed.\" But it turns out that this is not at all how Verilog-XL and
NCVerilog handle things.</p>

<p>Instead, both of these tools include a notion of <i>include directories</i>.
These directories are similar to, but distinct from, the <i>library
directories</i> which are used to load \"missing\" modules.  These directories
are configured with command-line options like:</p>

@({
 +incdir+/home/jared/dir1 +incdir+/home/jared/dir2 ...
})

<p>When these tools see @('`include \"foo.v\"'), they seem to search for
@('foo.v') in these include directories, and include the first file that is
found.</p>

<p>Because of this, it does <i>not</i> work to just try to write includes
relative to whatever file is being loaded, you just always write them relative
to whatever the include path is going to be.</p>")

<p>We are told that filename here can be a relative or absolute path, but there
is not any discussion of the actual syntax of the filename (e.g., as it relates
to escaping).  I believe it should be read as an ordinary string literal.  As
evidence for this belief:</p>

<ul>

<li>In Section 19.7 where @('`line') directives are covered, we are told that
the filename for @('`line') directives is a string constant, so if there is any
justice in the world the filenames for @('`includes') should be the same.</li>

<li>I tried using Verilog-XL and NCVerilog to @('`include
\"test\\055latch.v\"'), where 055 is the octal character code for the dash
character, and both systems were happy with this.  So, it seems like these
tools are treating it as an ordinary string constant.</li>

</ul>

appear on the same line as an @('`include') directive.  We don't currently try

;
;    //@VL FOO // comment goes here    , and
;    //@VL FOO /* comment starts here...
;
; And only read up to the start of the comment.  In other words, the above

;
;    (* FOO *) // comment goes here    , and
;    (* FOO *) /* comment start here...
