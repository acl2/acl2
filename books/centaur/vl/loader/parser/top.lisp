  :short "A parser for a subset of Verilog and SystemVerilog."

  :long "<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Our parser is responsible for processing a list of @(see tokens) into our
internal representation of Verilog @(see syntax).  Typically these tokens are
produced by the @(see lexer).  Note that before parsing begins, any whitespace
or comment tokens should be removed from the token list; see for instance @(see
vl-kill-whitespace-and-comments).</p>

<p>We use essentially a manual recursive-descent style parser.  Having the
entire token stream available gives us arbitrary lookahead, and we occasionally
make use of backtracking.</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>Verilog and SystemVerilog are huge languages, and we can parse only a subset
of these languages.</p>

<p>We can currently support most of the constructs in the Verilog 1364-2005
standard.  Notably, we do not yet support user-defined primitives, generate
statements, specify blocks, specparams, and genvars.  In some cases, the parser
will just skip over unrecognized constructs (adding @(see warnings) when it
does so.)  Depending on what you are doing, this behavior may be actually
appropriate, e.g., skipping specify blocks may be okay if you aren't trying to
deal with low-level timing issues.</p>

<p>We are beginning to work toward supporting SystemVerilog based on the
1800-2012 standard.  But this is preliminary work and you should not yet expect
VL to correctly handle any interesting fragment of SystemVerilog.</p>")
