meaningless if we want to consider the post synthesis/build behavior of the

<p>This transform can be run at any time.  Back in VL2014 it was important to
run it somewhere before the old @(see vl2014::always-top) transform, since some
always-block code was reluctant to process modules with @('initial')
statements.  That probably doesn't matter anymore.</p>")
