  :long "<p>Verilog allows wires to be implicitly declared in certain cases.
For instance, even if @('w') has not yet been declared, you can write things
like:</p>

@({
    assign w = &in;
})

<p>and we are to assume that @('w') is a one-bit wire.  This is mostly
straightforward but there are some subtleties; see @(see
implicit-wires-minutia) for more discussion.</p>

<p>Our general approach to handling these wires in VL is to add explicit
declarations for them.  Having explicit declarations seems like a generally
good idea.  For instance, it allows us to easily check for conflicting
declarations with the same name, and to generally assume that when we look
something up we should get a real declaration for it.</p>

<p>Historically, VL added explicit declarations for these wires as part of the
@(see loader), even before a proper @(see vl-module-p) structures were
generated, which allowed us to easily consider the order of module elements.
But when we added support for SystemVerilog @('import') statements, we found
this approach to be tricky.  In particular, to decide whether we need to add a
declaration for some particular wire @('foo'), we now need to consider whether
@('foo') is defined by any imported package.  For this to work, we really want
to be able to inspect the whole @(see vl-design) while making implicit wires.
We therefore decided to split making implicit wires out of the parser and into
a separate transform.</p>

<h3>Note: Special Transform!</h3>

<p>This transform is unique and we generally expect to run it as the first step
after parsing.  Normally it is invoked as part of @(see annotate).  It is also
closely related to @(see shadowcheck)&mdash;indeed, it invokes
shadowcheck&mdash; and the two should generally be regarded as a single,
unified transition from just-parsed modules to a more canonical form.</p>

<p>The special thing about @('make-implicit-wires') and @('shadowcheck') is
that these transforms we need to process module elements in parse order, i.e.,
the order that things occur in the source files.  In contrast, throughout the
rest of VL we pay no attention to the parse order and just treat modules as if
they contain various sets of elements (e.g., assignments, gates, etc.).</p>

<p>The elements are available in parse order in the special @('parse-temps')
field of the @(see vl-module).  Other transforms should never look at
@('parse-temps'), but should refer to these typed fields, instead.</p>")

  :short "Some details about implicit wires."
  :long "<p>Adding implicit wires turns out to be surprisingly subtle.  Here
are some notes about implicit wires in Verilog-2005.</p>

<p>When a wire is implicitly declared, its type is controlled by the
@('`default_nettype') compiler directive (Section 19.2).  But VL's @(see
preprocessor) does not yet support this directive and will cause an error if it
is used, so for now we can safely assume any implicit wires should just have
type @('wire').  (We can probably add support @('default_nettype') without too
much work, since our new approach of going through the module elements
sequentially means that we have easy access to location information.  On the
other hand, this is a really subtle directive to be using and we hope nobody
tries to use it.)</p>

<p>We think wires need to be declared, explicitly or implicitly, before being
used.  The Verilog-2005 standard seems not to explicitly say whether or not
this is the case, and the language at the start of Section 4.5 is somewhat
vague: we are supposed to assume implicit nets <i>in the absence of an explicit
declaration</i> in certain situations.  But later in 4.5 we find some language
that pretty strongly suggests we are only to consider whether or not there is
an explicit declaration <i>before</i> the use of the net: \"<i>and that
identifier has not been <b>declared previously</b> in the scope...</i>.\"</p>

<p>Section 4.5 outlines the conditions under which an implicit wire declaration
is supposed to be made.  In each case, the implicit declaration is to be added
to the nearest scope.  It seems like this mostly only matters in the case of
@('generate') blocks.  You might think that it would matter for functions,
tasks, and named blocks as well, but it doesn't seem possible to use implicit
wires in these contexts, see bullet #4 below for details.</p>

<p>Note: I think that throughout Section 4.5, the words <i>port expression
declaration</i> are a typo that should be <i>port declaration</i>; nowhere else
in the Verilog-2005 standard do the words <i>port expression declaration</i>
occur, at least according to Acrobat's find function.</p>

<h4>Case 1</h4>

<p>If there is a port declaration like @('input [3:0] i;') that has no
corresponding wire declaration, then we are supposed to infer an implicit net
with the vector width of the \"port expression declaration,\" which I think
means the @('[3:0]') part.  This seems basically reasonable when you just read
it, but there are a lot of subtle issues that arise; see #7 below for some
experiments.</p>

<p>Note that per 12.3.3, a port declaration like @('input wire [3:0] i;') is
treated as both an input declaration and an explicit wire declaration.  We
don't have to do anything special to handle this, because the parser
automatically builds both a @(see vl-portdecl-p) and a @(see vl-vardecl-p) for
such declarations; see @(srclink vl-parse-port-declaration-noatts).</p>

<h4>Case 2</h4>

<p>If there is an undeclared identifier in the terminal list of a primitive or
module instance, or in the left-hand side of a continuous assignment statement,
then we are supposed to infer an implicit, scalar net.</p>

<p>I think a \"primitive instance\" is supposed to mean either a gate instance
or a user-defined primitive instance.  See for instance Section 7.1.6, which
talks about \"primitive instance connection lists\" in reference to gates, and
11.6.6 where primitive terminals are distinguished from module ports.  So, this
means we should infer implicit wires in the ports/terminals of any instance,
regardless of whether it's a gate/udp/module.</p>


<h3>Implicit Wires in Verilog Tools</h3>

<p>We developed some tests (see @('test/test-implicit.v')) to see how
Verilog-XL and NCVerilog handle implicit wires.  Here are our findings.</p>

<p><b>#1</b>.  As expected, both allow implicit wires to be inferred from the
arguments of gate and module instances.  This seems to be the intent of Case
2.</p>

<p><b>#2</b>.  As expected, both complain about undeclared wires on the
right-hand side of an @('assign') statement.  This seems to agree with Case
2.</p>

<p><b>#3</b>.  As expected, NCVerilog allows us to infer implicit nets from the
left-hand sides of @('assign') elements.  Unfortunately, Verilog-XL complains
about such wires, which seems to contradict the Verilog-2005 standard.  We
choose to mimick NCVerilog and infer the implicit net.  Historically we also
issued warnings that other tools like Verilog-XL may not allow the construct,
but these warnings seemed to be noise and we eventually decided that it would
be better not to issue them.</p>

<p>A subtle case is, what if #2 and #3 overlap, i.e., an undeclared wire occurs
on both the left-hand and right-hand sides?  This isn't entirely contrived;
someone might occasionally write things like @('assign {a, abar} = {foo, ~a}').
NCVerilog seems to process the left-hand side first, and hence it allows us to
infer an implicit wire for @('w') when we give it an assignment like @('assign
w = w').</p>

<p><b>#4</b>.  Mostly as expected, neither tool allows undeclared wires on
either side of an assignment in an always block.  The tools even reject
implicit wires in procedural continuous assignments, e.g., @('always @(b)
assign w = a;').</p>

<p>This seems arguably incorrect: is not a procedural continuous assignment
also a continuous assignment, whose LHS should therefore be able to contain
implicit wires?  But we mimick these tools and disallow the implicit net, even
thought the spec might perhaps be interpreted as allowing it.</p>

<p>A nice consequence of disallowing implicit wires here is that it allows us
to avoid certain scoping questions.  In particular, suppose we see a procedural
continuous assignment statement, @('assign w = ...'), where @('w') is not
already declared.  If this statement occurs in a task or a named block within
an initial/always statement, should the declaration for @('w') be added to the
module or to this more local scope?  I'm not sure.  So, the good thing about
not inferring implicit nets for these assignments is that I don't have to be
able to answer the question, because I'm not going to infer a net anyway.</p>

<p><b>#5</b>.  As expected, neither implementation tolerates undeclared wires
on either side of assignments in function bodies.  This seems perfectly
reasonable since functions aren't allowed to have procedural continuous
assignments (10.4.4 E).</p>

<p><b>#6</b> As expected, both Verilog-XL and NCVerilog require that all wires
be declared (either explicitly or implicitly) before they are used.  For
instance, they if @('a') is declared but @('w') is not, then they reject code
fragments such as:</p>

@({
assign a = w;   // error here, saying w is undeclared
wire w;
})

<p>And also for code like this:</p>

@({
not(a, w);
wire w;         // error here, saying w is implicitly declared above
})


<p><b>#7</b> The whole declare-before-use thing is pretty strange for ports.
Suppose @('c') is a port of the module.  Then, both NCVerilog and Verilog-XL
will complain if you try to write:</p>

@({
wire c2 = c;    // error here, saying c is not declared.
input c;
})

<p>Verilog-XL seems to require the port declaration to come before the wire
declaration, if any.  That is, it considers the following an error, whereas
NCVerilog allows it:</p>

@({
wire c;
input c;
})

<p>This seems to hold for implicit declarations, too.  For instance, Verilog-XL
rejects the following, but NCVerilog allows it:</p>

@({
buf(c, c2);     // implicit declaration of wire c here
input c;
})

<p>But both Verilog-XL and NCVerilog allow the following, even though you might
think the buf gate would introduce an implicit declaration of @('c') that would
conflict with the explicit declaration.</p>

@({
input c;
buf(c, c2);
wire c;
})

<p>We try to be permissive and mimick NCVerilog, but add a (non-fatal) warning
if a wire's net declaration comes before its port declaration to explain that
some other tools do not permit this.</p>


<h3>Other Notes</h3>

<p>In previous versions of VL, we allowed declarations to come in any order,
and inferred an implicit wire whenever a wire was used in a context that
permitted it.  We now try to be more faithful to other Verilog systems and
require that wires be declared before their first uses, since this seems like
the right way to interpret the Verilog-2005 standard.</p>

<p>With regard to Case 1, we add a net declaration for each port declaration
that is missing a corresponding wire declaration.  In the process, we make sure
that at least some declaration (be it a wire or port declaration) of each port
occurs before every use of the port.  If only a wire declaration occurs before
some use of the port wire, we issue a non-fatal warning saying that Verilog-XL
does not tolerate this ordering.</p>

<p>When we add implicit wires for ports, we use the range of the port
declaration, which seems to be correct with respect to the \"vector width of
the port declaration expression,\" described above.  We also keep the
signedness of the port, which isn't discussed above, but appears to be the
correct thing to do; see @(see portdecl-sign) for details.  We place the
implicit wire declaration at the same location as the corresponding port
declaration, which seems like the easiest place to put it.  We also mark each
implicit wire declaration with the @('VL_PORT_IMPLICIT') attribute.  This
attribute is used by the @(see printer) to avoid printing any net declarations
that were implicit.</p>

<p>With regard to Case 2, we add one-bit wire declarations for any undeclared
wires that occur within the port arguments of gate and module instances, and
which occur in the left-hand sides of continuous assignments.  For assignments,
we always issue a non-fatal warning that says Verilog-XL doesn't add implicit
nets here, and we always process the left-hand side first (like NCVerilog).  We
add the wire declarations at the locations in which they are implicitly
declared, and mark them with the @('VL_IMPLICIT') attribute, which is useful in
@(see typo-detection).</p>")



; FEATURE-CREEP WARNING.
;
; It is tempting to try to do a lot here, e.g., we might want to check for any
; illegally redefined wires, compatibility between port and net declarations,
; etc.  But after some false starts down this road, I think this is a mistake.
;
; We only need to care about the order of elements to properly handle adding
; implicit wires.  Other kinds of well-formedness checks, e.g., that make sure
; nothing is multiply defined, that the ports/netdecls agree, etc., really
; don't need to consider module element order, so keep them separate!
;
; We used to check, here, that names are defined before being used.  That made
; some amount of sense since that's highly related to parse order.  But we now
; prefer to relegate this to shadowcheck, where we have full scopestacks and
; can generally look things up more reliably.

  :long "<p>Experimentation with NCVerilog and VCS reveals that only certain
names within expressions lead to implicit wires being declared.  See especially
the @('vl/linttest/implicit') tests for a test suite of sorts.  Here are some
findings:</p>

<ul>

<li>If we have a plain name on the left-hand side, like @('assign foo = 0'), then
we get an implicit wire.</li>

<li>If we instead have something like @('assign foo.bar = 0'), then we're
referencing something elsewhere and we don't want to create implicit wires
named @('foo') or @('bar').</li>

<li>When @('foo') is not previously declared, both NCVerilog and VCS reject
@('assign foo[0] = 0').  So I don't think we want to collect names that have
indexing or part-selects applied to them.  On the other hand, NCVerilog rejects
but VCS accepts (with warnings) gates such as @('buf mybuf(o, foo[0])'), and
seems to infer a wire for @('foo').  We will try to mimic NCVerilog's behavior
since it is more consistent, and <i>not</i> infer wires that are being indexed
into.</li>

<li>Suppose we explicitly declare @('wire [3:0] vec;').  Then both NCVerilog
and VCS reject @('assign vec[w] = 0') where @('w') is undeclared, instead of
inferring an implicit wire @('w').  So I think we do not want to collect names
from <i>within</i> the indices and part-selects.  However, distressingly, NCV
and VCS both accept @('buf myand2(o, vec[w]);'), so what is the rule?  I think
it seems most sensible to not infer implicit wires within the index
expressions.</li>

<li>Within gate connections, NCV and VCS allow implicit wires in many
expressions, e.g., @('w1 + w2'), @('myfun(w)'), both sides of @('inside')
expressions, etc.  (These kinds of expressions aren't allowed in the LHS of
assignments, so we don't worry about them there.)</li>

<li>In submodule connections, NCV allows implicit wires to be inferred inside
of assignment patterns like @('triple_t'{a:implicit_w1,b:implicit_w2,...}').
Our version of VCS says this isn't yet implemented.</li>
