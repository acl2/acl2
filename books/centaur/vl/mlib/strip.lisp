  :short "Functions for throwing away attributes, widths, locations, etc., so
that expressions and module elements can be compared using @(see equal)."

  :long "<p>In many basic kinds of @(see lint)ing and well-formedness checking,
it is useful to be able to compare module elements using @('equal').  But
@('equal') can report that elements are different because of, e.g., their
location information, widths and other annotations on expressions, and other
kinds of semantically irrelevant attributes.</p>

<p>These <b>stripping</b> functions attempt to strip away these kind of
semantically irrelevant components of module elements, so that they can be
compared with @('equal').  For instance, we replace all locations with @(see
*vl-fakeloc*), replace all attributes with @('nil'), etc.</p>

<p>Exactly what we throw away depends on the kind of module element.  In some
cases this may not be exactly what you want.  See the individual functions for
details.</p>")
