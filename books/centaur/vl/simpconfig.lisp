     allowed to assume that the cases are mutually exclusive and simplify the logic
     accordingly. For @('unique') they can assume that exactly one of the tests
     will be true.  This configuration flag is a natural number that sets the degree
     of conservativity, as follows: When 0 (the default), the logic we generate
     emulates a simulator, which always executes the first matching case.  When
     1, if uniqueness is violated, then we pretend that all tests that were 1 instead
     evaluated to X, or if all tests were 0 then we pretend all instead evaluated
     to X.  When 2 or greater, when the condition is violated we pretend all tests
     evaluated to X.  When 3 or greater, we additionally pretend that all assignments
     within the case statement write X instead of the given value.  The intention
     behind this is to make it likely that our logic is conservative with respect
     to anything a synthesis tool might produce.")

      Likely you do not want both this and @('uniquecase-conservative') to be set,

     flexibility in dealing with unique and unique0 case statements.  When this
     is set, we separately store a constraint saying that the cases are one-hot

     says that an enum field's value is one of the proper values of an enum type.
      If NIL (the default), these constraints are not generated. If T or any nonnil
