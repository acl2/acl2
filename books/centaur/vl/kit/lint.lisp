href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29'>linter</a> is a tool
that looks for possible bugs in a program.  We have used @(see VL) to implement
a linter for Verilog and SystemVerilog designs.  It can scan your Verilog
designs for potential bugs like size mismatches, unused wires, etc.</p>

<p>Note: Most of the documentation here is about the implementation of various
linter checks.  If you just want to run the linter on your own Verilog designs,
you should see the VL @(see kit).  After building the kit, you should be able
to run, e.g., @('vl lint --help') to see the @(see *vl-lint-help*)
message.</p>")

UNDERSTANDING THESE WARNINGS.

1. VL-WARN-TRUNCATION warnings are issued when the left-hand side of an
assignment statement is not as wide as the right-hand side.

False positives here can typically be suppressed by using part-selects to make
the intended truncations explicit.  For instance:

    wire [47:0] foo ;
    wire [63:0] bar ;

    assign foo = bar ;        // implicit truncation, causes warning
    assign foo = bar[47:0] ;  // explicit truncation, no warning

    assign foo = condition ? bar : 0 ;      // implicit truncation, causes warning
    assign foo = condition ? bar[47:0] : 0; // explicit truncation, no warning


2. VL-WARN-EXTENSION warnings are the opposite: they are issued when the
left-hand side is wider than the right-hand side would have been on its own.

False-positives can again typically be suppressed by explicitly concatenting in
zeroes, or by using part-selects to cut the left-hand side to the right size.
For instance:

    wire [47:0] foo ;
    wire [63:0] bar ;

    assign bar = foo ;             // implicit extension, causes warning
    assign bar = { 16'b0, foo } ;  // explicit extension, no warning
    assign bar[47:0] = foo;        // no extension, no warning


Note that we consider certain truncation and extension warnings to be \"minor\"
and do not report them here.  Such warnings are unlikely to be a problem, but
you can see \"vl-trunc-minor.txt\" to review them.")))

UNDERSTANDING THESE WARNINGS.

1.  VL-WARN-TRUNCATION-32 warnings are generated for any assignments that are
being truncated and whose right-hand sides are 32-bits wide.  This is a minor
warning because it typically arises from assignments where plain integers are
involved, e.g., if foo and bar are 10 bits wide, then a truncation-32 warning
will be generated for:

    assign foo = bar ^ 5;

This is because \"5\" has an implementation-dependent width (of at least 32
bits), and in VL-Lint we treat it as being 32-bits wide.  So, the above
describes a 32-bit XOR that is then truncated down to 10 bits.  Fixing these
warnings is usually easy: just explicitly specify the sizes of the numbers
involved, e.g., a \"corrected\" version might be:

    assign foo = bar ^ 10'd 5;

This is generally a good idea since it avoids any implementation-dependent
sizing (which can occasionally affect the results of expressions).


2.  VL-WARN-EXTENSION-MINOR warnings are generated for any assignments where
the width of the left-hand side is used to size the expression, and where the
right-hand side involves only addition operations.  For instance, given:

    wire [9:0] foo;
    wire [9:0] bar;
    wire [9:0] sum;
    wire carry;

Then an assignment like this:

    assign { carry, sum } = foo + bar;

would result in a minor extension warning.  These warnings are typically quite
minor since you frequently want to get the carry out of a sum.  But you could
suppress them by writing something like this:

    Variant 1: assign {carry, sum} = {1'b0,foo} + bar;
    Variant 2: assign {carry, sum} = foo + bar + 11'b0;

or similar, to make explicit on the right-hand side that you want an 11-bit
wide addition instead of a 10-bit wide addition.")))
