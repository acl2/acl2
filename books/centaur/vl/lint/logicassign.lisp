  :short "Basic check for declaration-time assignments to @('logic') variables."

  :long "<p>SystemVerilog encourages logic designers to use @('logic')
variables to avoid having to distinguish between nets and regs.  But a
fundamental problem with this is that declaration-time assignments to regs and
nets are very different.  For instance,</p>

@({
    wire [3:0] foo1 = a + b;   // Continuous assignment to foo1
    reg [3:0] foo2 = a + b;    // One-time, initial assignment to foo2
})

<p>Since @('logic') variables act like regs here, a logic designer who
writes</p>

@({
    logic [3:0] foo3 = a + b;
})

<p>gets a one-time, initial value assignment to @('foo3'), which is quite
possibly not at all what they meant if they've been led to believe that
@('logic') is a new, wonderful replacement for both @('wire') or @('reg').</p>

<p>Here we just implement a completely stupid check to look for
declaration-time assignments of variables.  If we see an assignment to a
@('reg') variable we don't complain, but if we see an assignment to something
else we issue a warning.</p>")
