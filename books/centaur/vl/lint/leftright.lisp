  :long "<p>This is a heuristic for generating warnings, inspired by PVS
Studio.  It has found a few pretty minor things that we were able to clean up,
and also found one interesting copy/paste bug.</p>

<p>We look for identical sub-expressions on the left and right of most binary
operations, for instance @('A | A') and @('A == A').  It is usually pretty
strange to write such an expression, and sometimes these indicate copy/paste
errors.  We do similar checking for the then- and else-branches of @('?:')
operators.</p>

<p>We also look for part-selects that use the same expressions for both
indices, e.g., @('foo[3:3]'), but these are somewhat more common and minor, and
sometimes result from macros or parameterized modules, so we generally think
these are pretty minor and uninteresting.</p>")

Out of 396,966 calls, 396,945 of them (99.99+%) had no duplicated members.
Furthermore, short lists are extremely common:</p>
