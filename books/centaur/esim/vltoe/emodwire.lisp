  :short "How we convert Verilog wires (which might be vectors) into E
wires (which are just bits)."

  :long "<p>A significant difference between E and Verilog is that there are no
vectors in E.  Whereas our Verilog module might have a vector like @('wire
[7:0] w'), our E module will instead have eight individual wires, whose names
are @('ACL2::|w[7]|') through @('ACL2::|w[0]|').</p>

<p>There is a fair bit of code geared towards making this bit-level conversion
safe and efficient.  As a quick summary:</p>

<ul>

<li>We represent each of these \"exploded\" wires like @('ACL2::|w[0]|') as an
@(see vl-emodwire-p).  This representation includes an encoding scheme that
usually produces readable names and avoids name clashes, even when escaped
identifiers are used.</li>

<li>The E wires for all of a module's net and register declarations can be
bundled into a @(see vl-wirealist-p).  A wire alist is generally constructed
with @(see vl-module-wirealist), which provides certain uniqueness
guarantees.</li>

<li>Certain \"simple\" expressions (similar to <see topic='@(url
expr-slicing)'>sliceable</see> expressions) can be converted into wires using
@(see vl-msb-expr-bitlist), which does lots of sanity checking to ensure that
the sizes and bounds of the expressions are correct and that only defined wires
are being used.</li>

</ul>

<p>BOZO much of this code predates the exprsesion slicing code.  We may wish to
eventually redo significant portions of the wirealist stuff to instead be based
on the expression-slicing code.</p>")

  :short "A simple encoding scheme to basenames that are free of certain
special characters."

  :long "<p>Usually Verilog wire names do not have special characters in them,
but with escaped identifiers it is possible to have names that include
brackets, dots, etc.</p>

<p>These special characters could pose certain problems.  The most obvious is
in a module such as this:</p>

@({
  wire [7:0] w ;
  wire \w[3] ;
})

<p>Here, the E wires corresponding to @('w') would be @('ACL2::|w[7]|') on down
to @('ACL2::|w[0]|').  But if we naively translate @('\w[3] ') into
@('ACL2::|w[3]|') then there could be a name clash.</p>

<p>To avoid this kind of problem, we use a simple encoding scheme that ensures
there are no brackets in the basename of a @(see vl-emodwire-p).  We originally
used the following, trivial encoding scheme:</p>

<ul>
<li>@('[ ---> {1')</li>
<li>@('] ---> {2')</li>
<li>@('{ ---> {3')</li>
</ul>

<p>But later we decided to slightly extend this scheme, to ensure that the
special characters @('.'), @('!'), and @('/') also do not occur.  Why?  We
think having @('.') in a name could be confusing to some tools since it is used
as a hierarchical identifier in Verilog.  Meanwhile, @('!') is used as a
hierarchical identifier in E (e.g., see @('mod-state')).  And we have
occasionally seen other Verilog tools that use @('/') as a hierarchical
separator.</p>

<p>To ensure these characters also do not occur, we extend our encoding scheme
in a simple way:</p>

<ul>
<li>@('. ---> {4')</li>
<li>@('! ---> {5')</li>
<li>@('/ ---> {6')</li>
</ul>

<p>This encoding is done automatically by the @(see vl-emodwire) constructor
and the appropriate decoding is done by the @(see vl-emodwire->basename)
accessor.  Usually no encoding is necessary, so these functions are optimized
for the case that there are no bracket or { characters.</p>

<p>Note that we actually implement the encoding and decoding functions in
raw-lisp for better performance.</p>"
