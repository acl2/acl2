<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The <i>Centaur Books</i> are
a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free</a> set of
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/">ACL2</a>
libraries for formal hardware verification including:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>VL</b> &mdash; a Verilog parser and simplification tool.</li>

<li><b>E</b> &mdash; a deeply embedded hardware description language with a
well-defined semantics.</li>

<li><b>ESIM</b> &mdash; a symbolic simulator for E modules.</li>

<li><b>GL</b> &mdash; a symbolic simulator for ACL2 functions and framework for
bit-blasting ACL2 theorems.</li>

<li>Many supporting libraries, e.g., for representing Boolean or four-valued
logic expressions, debugging ESIM runs with waveforms, reasoning about
arithmetic, and so forth.</li>

</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.centtech.com/">Centaur Technology</a> is a small company
in Austin, TX.  We
design <a href="http://www.via.com.tw/en/products/processors/">x86
processors</a> for our parent company, <a href="http://www.via.com.tw/">VIA
Technologies</a>.  We have used these books to prove correctness properties of
several execution units, and to develop other tools such as an equivalence
checker, a linter, etc.</p>

<p><b style="color: #ff0000;">Warning:</b> you are welcome to use these books,
but you should expect them to be much less stable than ordinary ACL2 books; we
are actively using them and often need to extend them.</p>


<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<dl>

<dt>Recommended Hardware</dt>

<dd>You will at least want a fast <b>dual-core</b> machine with <b>8 GB</b> of
memory.  Having additional cores is very useful for quickly re-certifying books
in parallel, but careful here: with more cores you'll need even more memory to
avoid swapping death.  A good target might be at least
<b>4 GB per core</b>.</dd>

<dd>We used to recommend even more memory than this.  Ample memory was
especially important when we carried out large proofs using BDDs, but these
days we often use SAT instead, and SAT is far less memory intensive.  Even so,
today many of our real hardware proofs are made faster (or possible) by having
32 or more GB of memory.  Also, many of our tools, e.g., our Verilog parser,
are written in a memory-hungry way because that's just the kind of environment
we work in.</dd>


<dt>Recommended Operating System</dt>

<dd>We use <b>64-bit Linux</b>.  Other unix derivatives like Darwin, FreeBSD,
etc., might work reasonably well, but Linux is our main platform.  Windows
probably won't work, although a Linux VM inside of Windows may be a fine
option.  You will need ordinary tools like perl, make, etc.</dd>


<dt>Clozure Common Lisp Configuration</dt>

<dd>We use 64-bit <a href="http://ccl.clozure.com/">Clozure Common Lisp</a>.
Other Lisps probably won't work.</dd>

<dd>We usually use a fairly recent SVN snapshot.</dd>

<dd><b style="color: #ff0000;">CCL Configuration before building ACL2:</b> We
use <a href="ccl-config.lsp">ccl-config.lsp</a> to do some extra configuration
that increases the stack sizes and tunes the garbage collector for better
performance.</dd>

<dd>We configure our <tt>PATH</tt> so that we can run CCL by
typing <tt>ccl</tt>.</dd>


<dt>ACL2 Configuration</dt>

<dd>We configure our <tt>PATH</tt> so that we can run ACL2(h) by
typing <tt>acl2</tt>.</dd>


<dt>cert.pl Configuration</dt>

<dd>We generally
use <a href='http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/manuals/current/manual/?topic=ACL2____CERT.PL'>cert.pl</a>
to certify books.  This script is located in the <tt>acl2/books/build</tt>
directory.</dd>

<dd>We configure our <tt>PATH</tt> so that we can run cert.pl by typing
<tt>cert.pl</tt>.  Note that other useful scripts like <tt>critpath.pl</tt> are
also in the <tt>acl2/books/build</tt> directory.</dd>

<dt>(Optional) GTKWave Configuration</dt>

<dd>You can skip this if you aren't doing hardware verification.</dd>

<dd>We often use <a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/">GTKWave</a> for
debugging waveforms.  Other VCD file viewers may also work.</dd>

<dd>We configure our <tt>PATH</tt> so that we can run GTKWave by
typing <tt>gtkwave</tt>.</dd>


<dt>(Optional) Sat Solver Configuration</dt>

<dd>We often use various SAT solvers in conjunction with GL.  See
<a href='http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/manuals/current/manual/?topic=SATLINK____SAT-SOLVER-OPTIONS'>SAT-SOLVER-OPTIONS</a>
for details about installing a suitable SAT solvers.</dd>

</dl>


<h3>Building the Books</h3>

<p>Once you have the above prerequisites, you will be ready to certify the ACL2
books.  We prefer to do this via:</p>

<pre>
$ # install prerequisites as explained above
$ cd [...]/acl2/books/
$ make USE_QUICKLISP=1 -j 4 centaur manual   # -j 4 for a quad-core processor
</pre>

<p>The USE_QUICKLISP=1 instructs <tt>make</tt> to enable support for
<a href='http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/manuals/current/manual/?topic=ACL2____QUICKLISP'>Quicklisp</a>,
which is necessary for certain books.</p>

<p>Depending on your hardware this may take ten minutes up to hours.  For
reference, it takes about an hour on an 8-core AMD-FX8350 with 32 GB of memory
running FreeBSD, using -j 8.</p>


<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>The <tt>make</tt> command above should produce the usual ACL2+Books manual
which covers the Centaur books and also has the regular documentation for ACL2
and other Community Books like arithmetic, std, etc.</p>

<p>To view the manual, point your web browser
at <a href="../doc/manual/index.html">acl2/books/doc/manual/index.html</a>&mdash;this
link will be broken until you generate the manual.</p>

<p>(Matt Kaufmann typically maintains a
 <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/manuals/current/manual/">fairly
recent version</a> of the manual at the UT web site, so you may usually not
need to build a local copy yourself.)</p>

<p>If you are specifically interested in hardware verification, there is also a
preliminary <b>tutorial</b> that walks through the verification of a trivial
ALU module.  To get started, see:</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<h3>Contact Information</h3>

<p>Unfortunately we can't offer any serious technical support.  We may be able
to answer some questions on an informal, "low bandwidth" basis, in our spare
time.</p>

<p>We ask that you send any technical questions, comments, or bug reports about
these books to
the <a href='https://utlists.utexas.edu/sympa/info/acl2-help'>acl2-help</a>
or <a href='https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/acl2-books'>acl2-books</a>
lists.</p>

<p>If for some reason that is not appropriate, you can send email directly to
Jared Davis and Sol Swords, <tt>{jared,sswords}@centtech.com</tt>.</p>
