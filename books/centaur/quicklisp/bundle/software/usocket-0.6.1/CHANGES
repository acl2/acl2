0.5.2:

* General: [SBCL] SOCKET-CONNECT's TIMEOUT argument was limited on non-Windows platforms.
* Bugfix: [CLISP] WAIT-FOR-INPUT now functions right (with/without READY-ONLY), this made Hunchentoot working on CLISP. (Thanks to Anton Vodonosov <avodonosov@yandex.ru>)
* Bugfix: [ABCL] Fix SOCKET-ACCEPT to follow the documented API so that when called without an :ELEMENT-TYPE argument. (Thanks to Mark Evenson, the ABCL developer)

* Enhancement: [CLISP] Better network error type detection based on OS error code.
* Enhancement: [LispWorks] Better network error type detection based on OS error code.
* Bugfix: Fixed wrong macro expansions of {IP|PORT}-{FROM|TO}-OCTET-BUFFER functions (since 0.4.0)
* Bugfix: SOCKET-CONNECT didn't set CONNECTED-P for datagram usockets on most backends.
* Bugfix: [SBCL] Fixes for "SBCL/Win32: finalizer problem, etc", by Anton Kovalenko <anton@sw4me.com>

* Bugfix: [CLISP] Fixed and confirmed UDP (Datagram) support (RAWSOCK version).

0.5.0:
