The files in this directory contain the solutions to the exercises.
Because adding and proving guards is an implicit exercise, all of the
functions (except for functions used only for proofs) have guards
(which are verified).  If you want to see the functions as they are
defined in the chapter, look at the files in the directory "../book".

Before you look at the files in this directory, note the following.

1.  We make heavy use of the "defung" macro.  Briefly, the defung
    macro is used to define a function and to describe the output type
    of a function.  There was no room in the article to describe the
    macro, so read "defung-intro.txt" before looking at the solutions.

2.  You can certify the books here using "cert.pl"

solutions.txt     - Solutions to exercises 20 and 24

The solutions to exercises are spread over all the files in this
directory.  The following table will allow you to find solutions
quickly.  Suppose that you are looking for the solution to Exercise 3,
part 5.  Start by finding the file which contains the solution, using
the table below.  Then, search for "; Exercise 3, part 5" in the file.
