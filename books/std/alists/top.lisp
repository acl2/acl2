  :parents (std alists)
  :short "A library for reasoning about association list (alist) operations
like @(see alist-keys), @(see alist-vals), @(see hons-get), etc."

  :long "<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>An association list is a fundamental data structure that
associates (\"binds\") some @('keys') to @('value')s.  In other programming
languages, alists may go by names like <i>dictionaries</i>, <i>maps</i>,
<i>hashes</i>, <i>associative arrays</i>, and the like.</p>

<p>The @('std/alists') library provides functions and lemmas about:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>\"traditional\" alist operations</b> like @(see alistp), @(see assoc),
and @(see strip-cars), which have long been built into ACL2.</li>

<li><b>\"modern\" alist operations</b> like @(see hons-assoc-equal), @(see
alist-keys), @(see make-fal), etc., which have better compatibility with
@(see fast-alists).</li>

</ul>

<p>In the \"traditional\" view, an alist is something recognized by @(see
alistp)&mdash;a @(see true-listp) of conses.  This @('alistp') recognizer
serves as a @(see guard) for functions like @(see assoc), @(see rassoc), @(see
strip-cars), and so forth.</p>

<p>In contrast, in the \"modern\" view, the @(see final-cdr) of an alist is not
expected to be @('nil'); instead it may be any atom.  (This can be used, e.g.,
to name @(see fast-alists) and to govern the sizes of their initial hash
tables; see @(see hons-acons) for details.)  Any traditional @(see alistp) is
still perfectly valid under this modern view, but these new kinds of alists,
with their weird final cdrs, are incompatible with traditional alist functions
like @(see assoc).</p>


<h3>The Non-Alist Convention</h3>

<p>Going further, in the modern view, we do not even expect that the elements
of an alist must necessarily be conses.  Instead, a modern alist function
simply skips past any atoms in its input.  We call this the <b>non-alist
convention</b>.</p>

<p>Following the non-alist convention means that functions like @(see
alist-keys) and @(see hons-assoc-equal) avoid needing any guard, which is
occasionally convenient.  More importantly, it means that when reasoning about
modern alist functions, we typically do not need any @(see alistp) style
hypotheses.  For instance, here is a typical, beautiful, hypothesis-free
theorem about @(see hons-assoc-equal):</p>

@({
    (equal (hons-assoc-equal key (append x y))
           (or (hons-assoc-equal key x)
               (hons-assoc-equal key y)))
})

<p>By comparison, the analogous theorem for the traditional @(see assoc)
function requires a hypothesis like @('(alistp a)') or @('(not (equal key
nil))').  Without such a hypothesis, we run into \"degenerate\" cases due to
taking the @(see car)s of arbitrary @(see atom)s.  For instance,</p>

@({
    let key = nil
    let x = (nil 1 2)
    let y = (a b c)

    then (assoc key x) --> nil
         (assoc key y) --> a

    (assoc nil (append x y))              --> nil   }
                                                    } different!
    (or (assoc key x)   -->  (or nil a)   --> a     }
        (assoc key y))
})

<p>This weird behavior for @('(assoc nil x)') leads to complications for many
theorems about traditional alist operations.  Following the non-alist
convention allows modern alist operations to avoid this problem.</p>


<h3>Loading the Library</h3>

<p>The recommended way to load the library, especially for beginning to
intermediate ACL2 users, is to simply include the top book, e.g.,</p>

@({ (include-book \"std/alists/top\" :dir :system) })

<p>This book loads quickly (typically in under a second), gives you everything
we have to offer, and sets up a \"recommended\" theory.</p>

<box><p>Note: Loading the @('std/alists/top') book will also result in loading
the @(see std/lists) library.  See the documentation for @('std/lists') for
important notes about its @(see equivalence) relations, the functions it will
@(see disable), etc.</p></box>


<h3>Things to Note</h3>

<p>When you include the @('top') book, several basic, built-in ACL2 alist
functions like @(see alistp), @(see strip-cars), @(see assoc), and so forth
will be @(see disable)d.  As a result, ACL2 will sometimes not automatically
try to induct as it did before.  You may find that you need to give explicit
@(':induct') @(see hints), or explicitly re-@(see enable) these basic functions
during certain theorems. (On the flip side, you may also find that you are
spending less time trying to prove theorems using incorrect induction
schemes.)</p>

<p>A very useful @(see equivalence) relation when working with association
lists is <b>@(see alist-equiv)</b>, which says whether alists agree on the
value of every key.  Many alist operations respect this equivalence relation.
It is generally a good idea to define appropriate @('alist-equiv') @(see
congruence) rules for new alist-processing functions.</p>")
