  :short "Discussion of the accessor/updater independence or <i>frame problem</i>,
          especially as it relates to the @(see def-updater-independence-thm) utility."
  :long "<p>Note: This is related to what is known as the frame problem in
philosophy/artificial intelligence/logic; for a broader discussion see <a
href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/frame-problem/\">this
article</a>.</p>

<p>When reasoning about structured data in ACL2, especially stobjs, one
commonly needs to know that a given updater has no effect on a given accessor.
During the development of any large program involving such a structured object,
the number and complexity of accessor and updater functions tends to grow until
the ad-hoc approach to the problem (proving each such theorem as it is needed)
becomes unworkable.</p>

<p>In the ad hoc approach, a given data structure might require a number of
theorems close to the product of the structure's accessor and updater count.
For many programs this isn't so large that it is impossible to generate and
prove all such theorems, but we propose a much more scalable approach here.</p>

<h3>Proposed Approach</h3>

<p>Broadly speaking, the approach requires the following two sorts of theorems:</p>

<p>The approach described here (and implemented by @(see
def-updater-independence-thm) relies on indexed accesses and updates of the
structure.  That is, there should be a single accessor and a single updater
function in terms of which all primitive accesses and updates can be logically
described, such as @('nth')/@('update-nth'), @('assoc')/@('acons'), or
@('g')/@('s').  If the data structure in question doesn't have such a single
accessor/updater, it is easy (though perhaps tedious) to define them.</p>

<p>The main idea is to prove two kinds of theorems that work together:</p>

<ul>
<li>For each accessor, a theorem stating sufficient conditions under which the
accessor applied to two different structures produces equal results.</li>

<li>For each updater, one or more theorems stating that the updater does not
change certain fields or accessor applications.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example 1</h4>
<p>The following theorem states that as long as element 3 of
two objects are equal, the @('access-3rd') of those two stobjs is equal:</p>
@({
 (implies (equal (nth 3 new) (nth 3 old))
          (equal (access-3rd new) (access-3rd old)))
 })

<p>Note that if we interpret this as a rewrite rule, the variable @('old') is
free, which would greatly limit is usefulness.  We use a @(see bind-free)
hypothesis to strategically bind @('old') to a good candidate; see below.</p>

<p>The following theorem states that for any element other than number 4,
@('update-4th') of an object preserves that element:</p>
@({
 (implies (not (equal (nfix n) 4))
          (equal (nth n (update-4th val x))
                 (nth n x)))
 })

<p>These two rules can be used with the bind-free strategy below to prove:</p>
 @({
  (equal (access-3rd (update-4th val x)) (access-3rd x))
  })

<h4>Example 2</h4>
<p>The following theorem states that as long as the first @('k') elements of
field 2 of two objects are equal, the non-primitive accessor @('sum-range-of-field2') of the two
objects is preserved:</p>
@({
  (implies (range-equal 0 k (nth 2 new) (nth 2 old))
           (equal (sum-range-of-field2 k new)
                  (sum-range-of-field2 k old)))
 })

<p>The following theorem states that the non-primitive updater @('clear-field2-from') only
affects elements k and above of field 2:</p>
@({
 (implies (< (nfix i) (nfix k))
          (equal (nth i (nth 2 (clear-field2-from k x)))
                 (nth i (nth 2 x))))
 })

<p>Given an appropriate reasoning strategy about @('range-equal') and the
bind-free strategy below, these two rules are sufficient to prove:</p>
 @({
 (implies (<= (nfix j) (nfix k))
          (equal (sum-range-of-field2 j (clear-field2-from k x))
                 (sum-range-of-field2 j x)))
 })

<h3>Free Variable Binding Strategy</h3>

<p>Accessor theorems of the form above contain a free variable @('old').  Our
approaches use two strategies to bind this variable:</p>

<ul>

<li>When trying to prove another such accessor rule, we bind @('old') to
@('old') whenever @('new') is bound to @('new') (and do not apply the rule
otherwise).  This strategy is effective as long as all such accessor rules are
phrased in terms of the same two variables.</li>

<li>In other contexts, we only apply the rule when @('new') is a function call.
In that case, we use the @('prev-stobj-binding') utility to bind @('old') to
one of the actuals of that function call, depending on the formals and
stobjs-out of the function in question.  For example, suppose @('foo') takes
formals @('(x val st$)') and has stobjs-out @('(nil st$)').  That is,
it (perhaps) modifies @('st$') and returns it as its second value.  Then if
@('new') is bound to @('(mv-nth 1 (foo k q bar))'), we will find @('(nth 1
stobjs-out) = st$'), find that @('st$') is the 3rd formal, and thus bind the
third actual, @('bar'), to @('old').</li>

</ul>")

(defthm range-equal-when-range-equal
  ;; Note!  This rule may look nonsensical but it can allow the rule
  ;; range-equal-badguy-upper-bound-when-not-equal, below, to fire when it otherwise couldn't.
  ;; An example below shows how this can happen.
  
  ;; To prove sum-range-of-update we want to apply trigger-range-equal,
  ;; and to prove that we need to relieve its hyp
  ;;    (range-equal (+ (nfix n) (nfix start)) num x y)
  ;; which when applied in this example becomes:
  ;;    (range-equal (+ (nfix 12) (nfix 5)) n (update-nth (+ 17 (nfix n)) 4 x) x)
  ;; When trying to relieve this hyp we first reduce the first argument to 17,
  ;; then try to prove range-equal using range-equal-by-badguy.
  ;; In the course of relieving its hyp
  ;;    (equal (nth badguy x) (nth badguy y))
  ;; (where badguy = (range-equal-badguy 17 n ...)
  ;; we need to show that badguy != (+ 17 (nfix n)).  So we try to apply
  ;; range-equal-badguy-not-equal-past-upper-bound, and thus have to relieve the hyp
  ;; (not (range-equal c num x y)) -- which is the negation of what we are
  ;; actually trying to prove.  So we should just be able to assume that.  But
  ;; ACL2's mechanism for assuming a hyp you're already trying to relieve
  ;; is the ancestor stack, and the relevant term
  ;; that is actually on the ancestor stack is not (range-equal 17 n ...)
  ;; but rather the original (range-equal (+ (nfix 12) (nfix 5)) n ...)

  ;; This rule solves that problem by triggering on the original hyp we are
  ;; trying to relive, effectively inserting the normalized form of the
  ;; range-equal hyp into the ancestor stack.

  ;; The rewrite failure cache can mess this up if this rule triggers after we
  ;; already try range-equal-by-badguy, so we situate this rule after that so
  ;; that it will be tried first.

  ;; One additional tweak we considered was to add a hyp
  ;;  (not (range-equal start num x y))

  ;; to range-equal-by-badguy, with backchain-limit 0.  That would have the
  ;; effect of preventing range-equal-by-badguy from being attempted when the
  ;; appropriate range-equal term was not in the ancestors stack.  Effectively,
  ;; we think that if range-equal-when-range-equal is tried first and the
  ;; application of range-equal-by-badguy fails, this would prevent trying the
  ;; same range-equal-by-badguy application again when it is even less likely
  ;; to work, because the appropriate ancestor isn't in the stack.  But we
  ;; don't think this is necessary because the rewrite failure cache will
  ;; presumably cause it to fail anyway.

  ;; An alternative to using this rule is to ensure that all range-equal hyps
