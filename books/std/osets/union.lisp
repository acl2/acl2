; Fast Union
;
; We want to show that fast union always produces a set, and has the expected
; membership property.


; PATCH (0.91): David Rager noticed that as of v0.9, fast-union was not tail
; recursive, and submitted an updated version.  The original fast-union has
; been renamed to fast-union-old, and the new fast-union replaces it.
