; quantify.lisp
;
; This is an optional extension of the sets library, and is not included by
; default when you run (include-book "top").
;
;
; Constructive Quantification over Sets and Lists.
;
; We create the macro, quantify-predicate, which introduces the following
; functions for any arbitrary predicate.
;
;     all<predicate>           all<not-predicate>
;     exists<predicate>        exists<not-predicate>
;     find<predicate>          find<not-predicate>
;     filter<predicate>        filter<not-predicate>
;
;     all-list<predicate>      all-list<not-predicate>
;     exists-list<predicate>   exists-list<not-predicate>
;     find-list<predicate>     find-list<not-predicate>
;     filter-list<predicate>   filter-list<not-predicate>
;
; In addition to introducing these functions, an entire rewriting strategy is
; introduced for reasoning about these functions with respect to sets and
; lists.
;
;
; Introductory Examples.
;
; Here are some of the most simple examples.  All of these predicates have only
; a single argument, and their guard is "t".
;
;     (SET::quantify-predicate (integerp x))
;     (SET::quantify-predicate (symbolp x))
;     (SET::quantify-predicate (rationalp x))
;     (SET::quantify-predicate (natp x))
;
; Notice that you cannot use macros here.  For example, the following is an
; error: (quantify-predicate (real/rationalp x)).  Once you have done the
; above, you can now run these functions, e.g.,
;
;     (SET::all<integerp> '(1 2 3)) = t
;     (SET::all<not-integerp> '(a b c)) = t
;     (SET::find<symbolp> '(1 2 3 a b c)) = a
;
;
; Controlling Packages.
;
; As you can see, all of these functions are introduced in the SET package by
; default.  If you'd like them to be in a different place instead, you can
; specify the :in-package-of argument and provide a symbol from some other
; package.  For example, since defthm is in the ACL2 package, we might write:
;
;     (SET::quantify-predicate (eqlablep x)
;       :in-package-of defthm)
;
; And then the functions all<integerp>, all<not-integerp>, and so forth will be
; in the ACL2 package instead of the SET package.
;
;
; Multi-Argument Predicates.
;
; You can also quantify over predicates with many arguments.  As an example, we
; introduce the function lessp as follows:
;
;     (defun lessp (a b)
;       (declare (xargs :guard t))
;       (< (rfix a) (rfix b)))
;
;     (quantify-predicate (lessp a b))
;
; We could now ask, is every element in a set less than some maximum value?
; For example:
;
;     (all<lessp> '(1 2 3) 6) = t
;     (all<lessp> '(1 2 3) 2) = nil
;
;
; Supporting Guards.
;
; If efficiency is important, our predicate may have guards and we may want to
; put guards on the introduced functions.  For example, we might write
; fast-lessp below:
;
;     (defun fast-lessp (a b)
;       (declare (xargs :guard (and (rationalp a)
;                                   (rationalp b))))
;       (< a b))
;
; Now we need to supply an extra :guard argument so that the guards of
; all<fast-lessp>, exists<fast-lessp>, and so forth can be verified.
;
; When writing this guard, the list which all-list<fast-lessp> and so forth are
; iterating over will be called ?list, and the set that all<fast-lessp> and so
; forth are iterating over will be called ?set.  The other arguments will all
; be named with whatever names you gave them when you ran quantify-predicate.
; For example, below we name fast-lessp's second argument "max", so it will be
; named "max" in our guards as well.
;
; Here's an example:
;
;     (in-package "ACL2")
;
;     (SET::quantify-predicate (rationalp x)
;       :in-package-of defthm)
;
;     (SET::quantify-predicate (fast-lessp x max)
;       :set-guard  ((all<rationalp> ?set))
;       :list-guard ((all-list<rationalp> ?list))
;       :arg-guard  ((rationalp max))
;       :in-package-of defthm)
;
;
;
; Disabling the theory.
;
; Calling quantify-predicate will result in a lot of theorems being introduced.
; You can disable all of these theorems by using the deftheory event
; theory<predicate>.  For example,
;
;     (in-theory (disable theory<integerp>))
;     (in-theory (disable theory<fast-lessp>))
;
; And so forth.

; the new functions.  Of course, we still have to generate the new names.
