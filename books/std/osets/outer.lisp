Q. Why do we need SUBSET enabled?

I think I understand what's going on here.  For a reproducible example, you can
just open up std/osets/outer.lisp and try to prove the first theorem with
subset disabled.  This leads to the goal below, which is perfectly fine, just
before the pick-a-point strategy kicks in:

   Subgoal 2.2
   (IMPLIES (IN A Y)
            (SUBSET (UNION Y (DELETE A X))
                    (UNION X Y))).

But after the hint applies, it produces a really weird goal, which ultimately
fails to prove and seems to be the real culprit:

   Subgoal 2.2.1
   (EQUAL (SUBSET SET-FOR-ALL-REDUCTION (UNION X Y))
          (COND ((EMPTY SET-FOR-ALL-REDUCTION) T)
                ((IN (HEAD SET-FOR-ALL-REDUCTION)
                     (UNION X Y))
                 (SUBSET (TAIL SET-FOR-ALL-REDUCTION)
                         (UNION X Y)))
                (T NIL))).

I don't like this goal at all.  It appears to be due to needing to prove that
(SUBSET X Y) is equivalent to (ALL X) when (PREDICATE A) == (IN A Y).  The goal
above basically corresponds to the recursive definition of ALL:

  (defun all (set-for-all-reduction)
    (declare (xargs :guard (setp set-for-all-reduction)))
    (if (empty set-for-all-reduction)
        t
      (and (predicate (head set-for-all-reduction))
           (all (tail set-for-all-reduction)))))

After tinkering around with several solutions, I think I found one that will
work well.  I'm doing a full regression with it now.  I'm not planning to
disable subset by default (which would be a bigger change), but with this rule
in place it does seem like the pick-a-point proofs in the osets library are
going through OK even with subset disabled, so I'm optimistic that the new
rule will work:

  (defthm pick-a-point-subset-constraint-helper
    ;; When we do a pick-a-point proof of subset, we need to show that (SUBSET X
    ;; Y) is just the same as (ALL X) with (PREDICATE A) = (IN A Y).  Since ALL
    ;; is defined recursively, the proof goals we get end up mentioning
    ;; HEAD/TAIL.  This doesn't always work well if the user's theory doesn't
    ;; have the right rules enabled.  This rule is intended to open up SUBSET in
    ;; only this very special case to solve such goals.
    (implies (syntaxp (equal set-for-all-reduction 'set-for-all-reduction))
             (equal (subset set-for-all-reduction rhs)
                    (cond ((empty set-for-all-reduction) t)
                          ((in (head set-for-all-reduction) rhs)
                           (subset (tail set-for-all-reduction) rhs))
                          (t nil)))))

Once the regressions pass I'll push it...

Cheers,
Jared
