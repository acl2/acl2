; top.lisp
;
; This is the top level file, which you should include to use the ordered set
; theory library.  Note that it does NOT include:
;
;   - The quantification extension for quantifying predicates over sets (i.e.,
;     for defining "typed" sets); see quantify.lisp instead, or
;
;   - The map extension for mapping/projecting a function across a set; see
;     map.lisp instead.
;
; The definitions in this file are redundant from the local include books.
; This approach has several advantages.
;
;  - it gives a better event order than simply including the books one by one
;
;  - this file is also faster to include than all of the local books below, and
;    allows the "ugliness" of auxilliary lemmas to be hidden away
;
;  - it makes clear that these theorems are public, and entirely prevents the
;    use of "internal" lemmas and theorems.

  :short "A finite set theory implementation for ACL2 based on fully ordered
lists.  Some major features of this approach are that set equality is just
@(see equal), and set operations like @(see union), @(see intersect), and so
forth have O(n) implementations."

  :long "<p>Osets mostly hides the fact that sets are represented as ordered
lists.  You should not have to reason about the set order unless you are trying
to exploit it to make some function faster.  Instead, we generally try to
reason about sets with a membership-based approach, via @(see in) and @(see
subset).</p>

<p>The osets library offers some automation for pick-a-point style reasoning,
see for instance @(see all-by-membership), @(see pick-a-point-subset-strategy),
and @(see double-containment).</p>

<p>You can load the library with:</p>
@({
 (include-book \"std/osets/top\" :dir :system)
})

<p>The definitions of the main set-manipulation functions are disabled, but are
in a ruleset and may be enabled using:</p>
@({
 (in-theory (acl2::enable* set::definitions))
})

<p>Some potentially useful (but potentially expensive) rules are also left
disabled and may be enabled using:</p>
@({
 (in-theory (acl2::enable* set::expensive-rules))
})

<p>Besides this @(see xdoc::xdoc) documentation, you may be interested in the
2004 ACL2 workshop paper, <a
href='https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-2004/contrib/davis/set-theory.pdf'>Finite
