; into an abstract argument which will form the basis for quantification, and
; especially for pick-a-point and double containment proofs.

; At the end of this file, we will disable all of the theorems that pertain to

  :long "<p>The logical definition of @('in') makes no mention of the set
order, except implicitly by the use of the set @(see primitives) like @(see
head) and @(see tail).</p>

<p>The :exec version just inlines the set primitives and does one level of loop
unrolling.  On CCL, it seems to run about 2.6x faster on the following
loop:</p>

@({
 ;; 4.703 sec logic, 1.811 sec exec
 (let ((big-set (loop for i from 1 to 100000 collect i)))
   (gc$)
   (time (loop for i fixnum from 1 to 30000 do (set::in i big-set))))
})

<p>There are other ways we could optimize @('in').  Since the set is ordered,
we could try to use the set order @(see <<) to stop early when we ran into an
element that is larger than the one we are looking for.  For instance, when
looking for 1 in the set '(2 3 4), we know that since @('1 << 2') that @('1')
cannot be a member of this set.</p>

<p>The simplest way to do this is to use @('<<') at every element.  But set
order comparisons can be very expensive, especially when sets contain large
cons structures.  So while it is easy to contrive situations where exploiting
the order would be advantageous, like</p>

@({
 (in 1 '(2 3 4 .... 100000))
})

<p>where we could return instantly, there are also times where it would be
slower.  For instance, on</p>

@({
 (in 100001 '(1 2 3 4 ... 100000))
})

<p>we would incur the extra cost of 100,000 calls to @('<<').</p>

<p>For this reason, we do not currently implement any short-circuiting.  The
reasoning is:</p>

<ul>

<li>it is not clear which would be faster in all cases,</li>

<li>it is not clear what the typical usage behavior of @('in') is, so even if
we wanted to benchmark alternate implementations, it may be hard to come up
with the right benchmarking suite</li>

<li>both solutions are O(n) anyway, and @('in') isn't a function that should
probably be used in any kind of loop so its performance shouldn't be especially
critical to anything</li>

<li>the current method is arguably no less efficient than an unordered
implementation.</li>

</ul>

<p>Future note.  In principle membership in an ordered list might be done in
@('O(log_2 n)').  We are considering using a <i>galloping</i> membership check
in the future to obtain something along these lines.</p>"

(defsection all-by-membership
  :parents (std/osets)
  :short "A way to quantify over sets."

  :long "<p>@('all-by-membership') is a generic theorem that can be used to
prove that a property holds of a set by showing that a related property holds
of the set elements.</p>

<p>The most important role of @('all-by-membership') is to allow for
pick-a-point proofs of @(see subset).  That is, it allows us to show that
@('(subset X Y)') holds by showing that every element of X satisfies @('(in a
Y)').</p>

<p>More generally, we could show that a set satisfies a predicate like
@('integer-setp') because each of its elements satisfies @('integerp').</p>


<h3>Pick-a-Point Proofs in ACL2</h3>

<p>We begin by explaining how pick-a-point proofs of subset can be carried out.
In traditional mathematics, @(see subset) is defined using quantification over
members, e.g., as follows:</p>

@({
  (equal (subset X Y)
         (forall a (implies (in a X) (in a Y))))
})

<p>This definition is very useful for <b>pick-a-point</b> proofs that some set
@('X') is a subset of @('Y').  Such a proof begins by picking an arbitrary
point @('a') that is a member of @('X').  Then, if we can show that @('a') must
be a member of @('Y'), we have established @('(subset X Y)').</p>

<p>These kinds of arguments are extremely useful, and we would like to be able
to carry them out in ACL2 about osets.  But since ACL2 does not have explicit
quantifiers, we cannot even write a theorem like this:</p>

@({
 (implies (forall a (implies (in a X) (in a Y)))
          (subset X Y))
})

<p>But consider the contrapositive of this theorem:</p>

@({
 (implies (not (subset X Y))
          (exists a (and (in a X) (not (in a Y)))))
})

<p>We <i>can</i> prove something like this, by writing an explicit function to
search for an element of @('X') that is not an element of @('Y').  That is, we
can prove:</p>

@({
 (implies (not (subset X Y))
          (let ((a (find-witness X Y)))
            (and (in a X)
                 (not (in a Y)))))
})

<p>Once we prove the above, we still need to be able to \"reduce\" a proof of
@('(subset X Y)') to a proof of @('(implies (in a X) (in a Y))').  While we
can't do this with a direct rewrite rule, we can sort of fake it using
functional instantiation.  As groundwork:</p>

<ul>

<li>Using @(see encapsulate), we introduce functions @('sub') and @('super')
with the constraint that @({
 (implies (in a (sub))
          (in a (super)))
})</li>

<li>Using this constraint, we prove the generic theorem:
@({
 (subset (sub) (super))
})</li>

</ul>

<p>Then, when we want to prove @('(subset X Y)') for some particular @('X') and
@('Y'), we can functionally instantiate the generic theorem with</p>

@({
   sub   <-- (lambda () X)
   super <-- (lambda () Y)
})

<p>And this allows us to prove @('(subset X Y)') as long as we can relieve the
constraint, i.e., @('(implies (in a X) (in a Y))').</p>


<h3>Generalizing Pick-a-Point Proofs</h3>

<p>In earlier versions of the osets library, we used an explicit argument to
reduce subset proofs to pick-a-point style membership arguments.  But we later
generalized the approach to arbitrary predicates instead.</p>

<p>First, notice that if you let the predicate @('(P a)') be defined as @('(in
a Y)'), then @('(subset X Y)') is just</p>

@({
 (forall a (implies (in a X) (P a)))
})

<p>Our generalization basically lets you reduce a proof of @('(P-setp X)') to a
proof of @('(implies (in a X) (P a))'), for an arbitrary predicate @('P').
This can be used to prove subset by just chooisng @('P') as described above,
but it can also be used for many other ideas by just changing the meaning of
@('P').  For instance, if @('P') is @(see integerp), then we can show that
@('X') is an @('integer-setp') or similar.</p>

<p>The mechanism is just an adaptation of that described in the previous
section.</p>

<ul>

<li>We begin by introducing a completely arbitrary @('predicate').</li>

<li>Based on @('predicate'), we introduce a new function, @('all'), which
checks to see if every member in a set satisfies @('predicate').</li>

<li>We set up an encapsulate which allows us to assume that some hypotheses are
true and that any member of some set satisfies @('predicate').</li>

</ul>

<p>Finally, we prove @('all-by-membership'), which shows that under these
assumptions, the set satisfies @('all').  This theorem can be functionally
instantiated to reduce a proof of @('(all X)') to a proof of</p>

@({
  (implies (in a X) (P a))
})"

  :long "<p>Double containment can be a good way to prove that two sets are
equal to one another.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, because this rule targets @('equal') it can get quite
expensive.  You may sometimes wish to disable it to speed up your proofs, as
directed by @(see accumulated-persistence).  In fact, this rule is disabled
when importing @('[books]/std/osets/top.lisp'). To reduce its cost when enabled,
this rule has a backchain limit.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are cases in which this rule works well, and where
the backchain limit is detrimental.  For this reason, we also provide a version
of the rule that has no backchain limit.  This version can be enabled
as needed.</p>"

; The general argument is the following:
;
; Suppose that we have two sets which are subsets of one another, i.e. (subset
; X Y) and (subset Y X) are true.  First, we will show that (head X) = (head
; Y).  Next we will show that (in a (tail X)) implies that (in a (tail Y)).
; This fact is then used for a subset by membership argument to show that
; (tail X) = (tail Y).  Now, (head X) = (head Y) and (tail X) = (tail Y) can be
; used together to show that X = Y (see primitives.lisp, head-tail-same) so we
; are done.

; Here are the details.  First we show that the heads are the same:

  (local (defthmd double-containment-lemma-head
	   (implies (and (subset X Y)
			 (subset Y X))
		    (equal (head X) (head Y)))
	   :hints(("Goal" :in-theory (enable (:ruleset order-rules))))))


; Next we show that (tail X) is a subset of (tail Y), using a subset by
; membership argument:

  (local (defthmd in-tail-expand
	   (equal (in a (tail X))
		  (and (in a X)
		       (not (equal a (head X)))))))

  (local (defthmd double-containment-lemma-in-tail
	   (implies (and (subset X Y)

			     (in a (tail Y)))) ; but that makes loops.

			 (subset Y X))
		    (subset (tail X) (tail Y)))
	   :hints(("Goal" :in-theory (enable double-containment-lemma-in-tail)))))

; Finally, we are ready to show that double containment is equality.  To do
; this, we need to induct in such a way that we consider the tails of X and Y.
; Then, we will use our fact that about the tails being subsets of one another
; in the inductive case.
