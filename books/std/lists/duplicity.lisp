(defsection duplicity
  :parents (std/lists count no-duplicatesp)
  :short "@(call duplicity) counts how many times the element @('a') occurs
within the list @('x')."

  :long "<p>This function is much nicer to reason about than ACL2's built-in
@(see count) function because it is much more limited:</p>

<ul>

<li>@('count') can operate on either strings or lists; @('duplicity') only
works on lists.</li>

<li>@('count') can consider only some particular sub-range of its input;
@('duplicity') always considers the whole list.</li>

</ul>

<p>Reasoning about duplicity is useful when trying to show two lists are
permutations of one another (sometimes called multiset- or bag-equivalence).  A
classic exercise for new ACL2 users is to prove that a permutation function is
symmetric.  Hint: a duplicity-based argument may compare quite favorably to
induction on the definition of permutation.</p>

<p>This function can also be useful when trying to establish @(see
no-duplicatesp), e.g., see @(see no-duplicatesp-equal-same-by-duplicity).</p>"
