  :short "Alternative to @(see concatenate) that has a shorter name and may in
some cases be more efficient."

  :long "<p>Concatenating strings is a fundamentally slow operation in Common
Lisp; see @(see concatenation).</p>

<p>In some Lisps, using @('(concatenate 'string ...)') can be even worse than
the necessary cost of creating and initializing a new array.  This is because
the @(see concatenate) function is quite flexible and can handle many types of
input (e.g., lists and vectors).  This flexibility can cause some overhead if
the Lisp does not optimize for the @(''string') case.</p>

<p>If you are willing to accept a trust tag, then you may <b>optionally</b>
load the book:</p>

@({
  (include-book \"str/fast-cat\" :dir :system)
})

<p>which may improve the performance of @('str::cat').  How does this work?
Basically @('str::cat') calls one of @('fast-string-append') or
@('fast-string-append-lst'), depending on how many arguments it is given.  By
default, these functions are aliases for ACL2's @(see string-append) and
@('string-append-lst') functions.  But if you load the @('fast-cat') book,
these functions will be redefined to use raw Lisp array operations, and the
result may be faster.</p>"

  :short "Possibly optimized way to reverse a character list and coerce it to a
string."

  :long "<p>@(call rchars-to-string) is logically equal to</p>

@({
   (reverse (implode rchars))
})

<p>We leave it enabled and would not expect to ever reason about it.  This
operation is useful as the final step in a string-building strategy where
characters are accumulated onto a list in reverse order; see for instance @(see
revappend-chars).</p>

<p>When you just load books like @('str/top') or @('str/cat'), this logical
definition is exactly what gets executed.  This definition is not too bad, and
doing the @(see coerce) first means that the @(see reverse) is done on a
string (i.e., an array) instead of a list, which is generally efficient.</p>

<p>But if you are willing to accept a trust tag, then you may <b>optionally</b>
load the book:</p>

@({
  (include-book \"str/fast-cat\" :dir :system)
})

<p>This may improve the performance of @('rchars-to-string') by replacing the
@(see reverse) call with a call of @('nreverse').  We can \"obviously\" see
that this is safe since the string produced by the @('coerce') is not visible
to any other part of the program.</p>"

(defsection revappend-chars
  :parents (concatenation)
  :short "Append a string's characters onto a list, in reverse order."

  :long "<p>@(call revappend-chars) takes the characters from the string
@('x'), reverses them, and appends the result onto @('y').</p>

<p>Its logical definition is nothing more than @('(revappend (explode x) y)').</p>

<p>In the execution, we traverse the string @('x') using @(see char) to avoid
the overhead of @(see coerce)-ing it into a character list before performing
the @(see revappend).  This reduces the overhead from @('2n') conses to @('n')
conses, where @('n') is the length of @('x').</p>

<p>This function may seem strange at first glance, but it provides a convenient
way to efficiently, incrementally build a string out of small parts.  For
instance, a sequence such as:</p>

@({
 (let* ((acc nil)
        (acc (str::revappend-chars \"Hello, \" acc))
        (acc (str::revappend-chars \"World!\" acc))
        (acc ...))
    (reverse (implode acc)))
})

<p>Is essentially the same as:</p>

@({
 (let* ((acc \"\")
        (acc (str::cat acc \"Hello, \"))
        (acc (str::cat acc \"World!\"))
        (acc ...))
   acc)
})

<p>But it is comparably much more efficient because it avoids the creation of
the intermediate strings.  See the performance discussion in @(see str::cat)
for more details.  Also see @(see rchars-to-string), which is a potentially
more efficient way to do the final @(see reverse)/@(see coerce) steps.</p>"
