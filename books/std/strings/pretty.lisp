much of ACL2's built-in pretty-printing capabilities."

  :long "<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This is a two pass, linear time, \"exact\" pretty printer for ACL2 objects.
My implementation is substantially based on the pretty-printing algorithm from
ACL2 6.4, and offers many similar features.</p>

<p>Why not just use ACL2's built-in pretty-printer?  As of ACL2 6.4, the
built-in pretty-printer is a program-mode function that makes heavy use of
@(see state); it gets its configuration settings (margins, arithmetic base,
etc.) out of state globals and does its printing via functions like @(see
princ$) which write to an output channel.  This can be inconvenient:</p>

<ul>

<li>You can't use ACL2's pretty-printer from logic-mode functions.</li>

<li>You need @(see state) available any time you want to create a string using
the printing functions.</li>

<li>The printing routines are generally not thread-safe.</li>

<li>Functions like @(see fmt-to-string) aren't usable outside of the ACL2
read-eval-print loop.</li>

</ul>

<p>My new pretty-printer has none of these problems.  Instead of incrementally
printing to an output stream, it builds up a character list in reverse order,
then reverses it with @(see rchars-to-string).  This uses more memory than
ACL2's pretty printer, but the overhead is linear in the size of the output.
Moreover, it appears to perform well---I measured it at about <b>5.5x
faster</b> than ACL2's pretty printer on one <i>possibly</i> realistic
benchmark; see @('std/strings/pretty-tests.lisp') for details.</p>


<h3>Quick Start</h3>

<p>The most convenient, high-level functions to use are:</p>

<ul>
<li>@(see pretty) - convert any ACL2 object into a string.</li>

<li>@(see revappend-pretty) - pretty print onto an accumulator, in reverse
order, which is useful for building strings as described in @(see
revappend-chars).</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many available settings that you can tune to customize the way
that objects are printed; see @(see printconfig-p) for details.  The defaults
are sensible and are mostly compatible with the way that ACL2 normally prints
things.</p>


<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>I do not reimplement the format-string style functions such as @(see fmt)
and @(see cw), although something like this is available as part of the @(see
vl::printer).  Instead, my focus here is on ACL2's @('ppr') functionality that
is at the heart of ACL2's s-expression printing.  In other words, this is an
implementation of something like the @('~x') @(see fmt) directive.</p>

<p>Even with respect to @('ppr'), there is some @(see missing-functionality).
I don't implement @(see acl2::iprinting) or include any infix printing support.
Various complex and unhelpful printer-control variables are also omitted.</p>


<h3>Implementation Details</h3>

<p>More details about the algorithm and implementation can be found in @(see
pretty-printing-implementation).</p>")

  :parents (pretty-printing)
  :short "Implementation details of our @(see pretty-printing) support."

  :long "<p>My implementation is very much based on ACL2's pretty printer.  The
pretty printer operates in two linear passes: the first pass builds a data
structure that tells the second pass how to print.  The basic algorithm dates
from about 1971 and was used in the earliest Edinburgh Pure Lisp Theorem
Prover.  It is described in:</p>

<box><p>Robert S. Boyer.  <a
href='http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~boyer/pretty-print.pdf'>Pretty-Print.</a> Memo
number 64.  Department of Computational Logic, School of Artificial
Intelligence, University of Edinburgh.  1973.</p></box>

<p>Some general principles of pretty-printer are:</p>

<ul>

<li>Print flat whenever possible, unless argument lists of length over (say)
40; since they become hard to parse.</li>

<li>Atoms and eviscerated things (which print like atoms, e.g., @('<world>'))
may be printed on a single line.</li>

<li>Parenthesized expressions should not be printed on a line with any other
argument (unless the whole form fits on the line).</li>

</ul>

<p>For instance:</p>

@({
          'GOOD'                            'BAD'

     (foo (bar a) b c d)   |            (foo (bar a) b |
                                             c d)      |
     (foo a b  |
          c d) |                          ^^ we think it's too easy to
                                             miss 'b' when reading this
     (foo (bar a)   |
          b c d)    |
})")

<p>We actually probably support evisceration in the printer, but the actual
evisceration step needs to be done separately.  I haven't looked at ACL2's
functions for this, yet.</p>

<h5>@('print-escape') and @('print-readably')</h5>

<p>ACL2's take on print-readably:</p>
<ul>
 <li>it binds print-readably to nil by default</li>
 <li>it offers set-print-readably</li>
 <li>it binds it to nil in princ$</li>
 <li>it consults it in needs-slashes -- along with print-escape</li>
 <li>it formerly marked it as untouchable</li>
</ul>

<p>ACL2's take on print-escape</p>
<ul>
<li>PROVE binds it to T when #+write-arithmetic-goals... er, wtf?</li>
<li>bound to t by default</li>
<li>controllable with set-print-escape</li>
<li>potentially important for princ$ that it be bound to nil</li>
<li>consulted by needs-slashes -- along with print-readably</li>
<li>bound in prin1$ to put |s on symbols</li>
</ul>

<p>CLHS regarding print-escape:</p>
<ul>
<li>If false, escape characters and package prefixes are not
    output when expressions are printed</li>
<li>if true, an attempt is made to print an expression in such a way
    that it can be read back in to produce an equal expression.
    but this is only a guideline.</li>
</ul>

<p>CLHS regarding print-readably:</p>
<ul>
<li>when true, special rules go into effect:
    <ul>
    <li>printing any object O1 produces a printed representation that,
        when seen by the Lisp reader with the standard readtable in
        effect, will produce an object O2 that is SIMILAR to O1.</li>
    <li>printing proceeds as if *print-escape*, *print-array* and
        *print-gensym* are true and as if *print-length*, *print-level*,
        and *print-lines* are false.</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

<p>After a lot of investigation and consideration, I don't think any of this is
anything we should care about.  I can't imagine why someone would want to hide
the package names for symbols from other packages.  The two options seem
perhaps entirely redundant in the context of ACL2 where there aren't arrays and
gensyms, so I don't know why ACL2 provides both.  At any rate, it seems much
better to just drop this complicated nonsense and have the printer do something
reasonable by default.</p>


<h5>write-for-read</h5>

<p>ACL2 also has another parameter named @('write-for-read'), which is somewhat
similar to @('print-readably') but affects different things.</p>

<p>It is used in @('fmt-tilde-s1') to decide whether to split up symbols after
the soft margin.  This can be nice for keeping the proof long word wrapped in a
nice style.  However, it can be troublesome for trying to copy/paste rule
names.  It's also consulted in maybe-newline, which is used in @(see fmt) code.
Functions like fmt1! and fmt!  and fms! bind it to true.</p>

<p>None of that matters yet because, at least at the moment, I am only
implementing PPR, not FMT, and all of that is FMT-level stuff.</p>

<p>@('write-for-read') also influences ACL2's @('spaces1') function.  When
@('write-for-read') is disabled, it prints @('\<newline>') sequences and then
continues printing spaces on the next line.  I don't think this is a
\"feature\" that I will miss, so I am not going to implement it.</p>")

;                          Basic Printing of Atoms
;
; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

; Summary of ACL2's atom-printing routines:
;
;   explode-atom -- convert any atom into a character list
;     for numbers, assumes print-radix is nil but knows about print bases
;     for symbols, prints just the symbol name, no packages, no escaping
;     for strings, just prints the contents, no escaping
;     for chars, just prints the character itself, no escaping/translation
;
;   explode-atom+ -- unless print radix, identical to explode-atom
;     for numbers, adds radix stuff around what explode-atom does
;     for strings/symbols/chars, identical to explode-atom
;
;   princ$ -- most basic way to print an atom to a stream
;     very complex: streams, wormholes, live states, printer controls
;     for symbols -- if downcasing, prints (string-downcase (symbol-name x))
;     for anything else, idental to explode-atom+: no packages/escaping
;
;   prin1$ -- for printing out things that can be read in
;     numbers: identical to princ$
;     characters: prints #\c for most characters, but also #\Newline, etc
;     strings: prints "foo", escaping as necessary
;     symbols: prints [pkg::]foo, escaping as necessary; printing package
;              depends on current package; prints lowercase if print-case
;              :downcase
;
; We now implement:
;
;    print-atom -- similar to princ$
;    print-escaped-atom - similar to prin1$
;
; Except that our versions don't deal with channels/state, they just accumulate
; characters in reverse order.

; Notes about CONS-PPR from ACL2:
;
; We want to build a tuple to print a given list form, like a function call.
; We basically get the tuple for the car and a list of tuples for the cdr and
; then use cons-ppr1 to combine them.  The resulting list of tuples will be
; embedded in either a WIDE or an indent tuple.  Thus, this list of tuples we
; will create describes a column of forms.  The number of items in that column
; is not necessarily the same as the number of arguments of the function call.
; For example, the term (f a b c) might be pretty-printed as
; (f a
;    b c)
; where b and c are printed flat on a single line.  Thus, the three arguments
; of f end up being described by a list of two tuples, one for a and another
; for b and c.

; To form lists of tuples we just use cons-ppr1 to combine the tuples we get
; for each element.

; Let x and lst be, respectively, a ppr tuple for an element and a list of
; tuples for list of elements.  Think of lst as describing a column of forms.
; Either x can become another item that column, or else x can be incorporated
; into the first item in that column.  For example, suppose x will print as X
; and lst will print as a column containing y1, y2, etc.  Then we have this
; choice for printing x and lst:

; lengthened column          lengthened first row
; x                          x y1
; y1                         y2
; ...                        ...

; We get the `lengthened column' behavior if we just cons x onto lst.  We get
; the `lengthened row' behavior if we merge the tuples for x and y1.  But we
; only merge if they both print flat.

; Essay on the Printing of Dotted Pairs and

; It is instructive to realize that we print a dotted pair as though it were a
; list of length 3 and the dot was just a normal argument.

; In the little table below I show, for various values of d, two things: the
; characters output by

; (ppr2 (ppr1 `(xx . yy) (print-base) (print-radix) d 0 state nil)
;       0 *standard-co* state nil)

; and the ppr tuple produced by the ppr1 call.
;
; d         output                 ppr tuple

;        |<-  9  ->|

; 9       (XX . YY)              (FLAT 9 (XX . YY))

; 8       (XX                    (3 8 (FLAT 2 XX) (FLAT 5 . YY))
;            . YY)

; 7       (XX                    (2 7 (FLAT 2 XX) (FLAT 5 . YY))
;           . YY)

; 6       (XX                    (1 6 (FLAT 2 XX) (FLAT 5 . YY))
;          . YY)

; 5       (XX                    (2 5 (FLAT 2 XX) (DOT 1) (FLAT 3 YY))
;           .

;          .
;          YY)

; The fact that the dot is not necessarily connected to (on the same line as)
; the atom following it is the reason we have the (DOT 1) tuple.  We have to
; represent the dot so that its placement is first class.  So when we're
; assembling the tuple for a list, we cdr down the list using cons-ppr1 to put
; together the tuple for the car with the tuple for the cdr.  If we reach a
; non-nil cdr, atm, we call cons-ppr1 on the dot tuple and the tuple
; representing the atm.  Depending on the width we have, this may produce (FLAT
; n . atm) which attaches the dot to the atm, or ((DOT 1) (FLAT n atm)) which
; leaves the dot on a line by itself.

; We want keywords to appear on new lines.  That means if the first element of
; lst is a keyword, don't merge (unless x is one too).
