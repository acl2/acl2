; Matt K. mod:
; The documentation formerly said:

;   BOZO it's too bad that the failure situations are handled so differently.
;   It would probably be nicer to never cause a hard error, and instead return
;   some explanation of why opening the file failed.

; In fact open-input-channel should never cause a hard error; this is ensured
; by the use of safe-open in its source code, which in turn invokes
; ignore-errors.  Perhaps it's possible to add some explanation, but it's not
; clear (to me, at this time) how to get that information from Lisp.  Even if
; we had that information, it would be a major change to open-input-channel to
; return a non-nil first value in the failure case.

<p>This is a @(see logic)-mode function, but its logical definition is tricky;

<p>Under the hood, we use Lisp's file operations to try to open the file.  On

Under the hood, this symbol will be associated with a raw Lisp file stream.
Note that to avoid resource leaks, you should eventually use @(see

from the Lisp input stream that is associated with @('channel').  If we reach

<h3>Character versus Byte Input</h3>

<p>In some sense, it is redundant for ACL2 to have separate kinds of input
channels for characters and bytes.  After all, ACL2 has exactly 256 @(see
characters) corresponding to bytes 0-255, and provides functions like @(see
char-code) and @(see code-char) for converting between these characters and
bytes.  So, one could easily define @('read-char$') as a wrapper that calls
@('code-char') on @('read-byte$'), or could define @('read-byte$') as a wrapper
for @('read-char$') that calls @('char-code').</p>

<p>That being said, we generally prefer to use byte input.  Common Lisp
implementations have some freedom in how they implement characters.  Because of
this, and because different Lisps might try to use different encodings when
reading files, ACL2's @('read-char$') has some extra checks to make sure that
the characters being read in are legal.  At any rate, for a basic timing test
on CCL, we measured @('read-char$') at 12.5% slower than @('read-byte$') with
@('code-char').</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is no equivalent of @('peek-char$') for @(':byte')
input streams.  So, that might be worth considering.</p>"

<ul>

<li>@('channel') is a symbol that must refer to an open @(':object') input
channel; see @(see open-input-channel).</li>

<li>@('state') is the ACL2 @(see state).</li>

</ul>

<p>This is a @(see logic)-mode function, but its logical definition is tricky;
see @(see logical-story-of-io).  The main logical consequence is the updating
of state.</p>

<p>Under the hood, we use the Lisp reader to try to read an object from the
Lisp input stream that is associated with @('channel').</p>

<p>Ideally, the input stream contains well-formed S-expressions that are free
of \"bad\" objects like @('0.75'), symbols from packages that ACL2 doesn't know
about, etc; see @(see ACL2::|About Types|).  In this case, @('read-object')
reads the first S-expression in the file and returns it as @('obj'), setting
@('eofp') to @('nil').  If there are no more S-expressions in the file,
@('eofp') is @('t') and @('obj') is @('nil').</p>

<p>But the input stream can also be malformed.  For instance, we might
encounter malformed S-expressions without enough closing parens, or bad objects
like @('0.75').  These sorts of problems will cause hard errors or raw Lisp
errors!</p>

<p>Note that if the input contains plain symbols without explicit package name
prefixes, e.g., @('foo') instead of @('acl2::foo'), then these symbols will be
treated as coming from the current package.  If that isn't what you want, you
can explicily call @(see in-package) to switch into whatever package you want
to be the default.  For example, if the file @('temp') contains exactly:</p>

@({
foo
})

<p>Then the following book:</p>

@({
 (in-package \"ACL2\")
 (include-book \"std/util/bstar\" :dir :system)
 (include-book \"centaur/vl/portcullis\" :dir :system)
