  :long "<p>Deflist lets you to quickly introduce recognizers for typed lists
like @(see nat-listp).  It defines the new recognizer function, sets up a basic
theory with rules about @(see len), @(see append), @(see member), etc., and

<h4>General Form</h4>

@({
 (deflist name formals
   element
   [keyword options]
   [/// other events]
   )

 Options                  Defaults
   :negatedp                nil
   :true-listp              nil
   :elementp-of-nil         :unknown
   :guard                   t
   :verify-guards           t
   :guard-hints             nil
   :guard-debug             nil
   :non-emptyp              nil
   :mode                    current defun-mode
   :cheap                   nil
   :verbosep                nil
   :parents                 nil
   :short                   nil
   :long                    nil
   :prepwork                nil
})

<h4>Basic Examples</h4>

<p>The following introduces a new function, @('my-integer-listp'), which
recognizes lists whose every element satisfies @('integerp'), and also
introduces many theorems about this new function.</p>

@({
 (deflist my-integer-listp (x)
   (integerp x))
})

<p><b><color rgb='#ff0000'>Note</color></b>: @('x') is treated in a special
way.  It refers to the whole list in formals and guards, but refers to
individual elements of the list in the @('element') portion.  This is similar
to how other macros like @(see defalist), @(see defprojection), and @(see
defmapappend) handle @('x').</p>

<p>Here is a recognizer for lists with no natural numbers:</p>

@({
 (deflist nat-free-listp (x)
   (natp x)
   :negatedp t)
})

<p>Here is a recognizer for lists whose elements must exceed some minimum:</p>

@({
 (deflist all-greaterp (min x)
   (> x min)
   :guard (and (natp min)
               (nat-listp x)))
})

<h3>Usage and Optional Arguments</h3>

<p>Let @('pkg') be the package of @('name').  All functions, theorems, and
variables are created in this package.  One of the formals must be @('pkg::x'),
and this argument represents the list to check.  Otherwise, the only
restriction on the formals is that you may not use the names @('pkg::a'),
@('pkg::n'), or @('pkg::y'), because we use these variables in the theorems we
generate.</p>

<p>The optional @(':negatedp') keyword can be used to recognize a list whose
every element does not satisfy elementp.</p>

<p>The optional @(':true-listp') keyword can be used to require that the new
recognizer is \"strict\" and will only accept lists that are
@('nil')-terminated; by default the recognizer will be \"loose\" and will not
pay attention to the final @('cdr').  There are various reasons to prefer one
behavior or another; see @(see strict-list-recognizers) for details.</p>

<p>The optional @(':elementp-of-nil') keyword can be used when @('(elementp nil
...)') is always known to be @('t') or @('nil').  When it is provided,
@('deflist') can generate slightly better theorems.</p>

<p>The optional @(':guard'), @(':verify-guards'), @(':guard-debug'), and
@(':guard-hints') are options for the @(see defun) we introduce.  These are for
the guards of the new list recognizer, not the element recognizer.</p>

<p>The optional @(':mode') keyword can be set to @(':logic') or @(':program')
to introduce the recognizer in logic or program mode.  The default is whatever
the current default defun-mode is for ACL2, i.e., if you are already in program
mode, it will default to program mode, etc.</p>

<p>The optional @(':verbosep') flag can be set to @('t') if you want deflist to
print everything it's doing.  This may be useful if you run into any failures,
or if you are simply curious about what is being introduced.</p>

<p>The optional @(':cheap') flag can be set to @('t') to produce cheaper, less
effective rule-classes for some rules; this may be convenient when the element
type is a very common function such as @('consp'), in which case adding
stronger rules might significantly slow down proofs.</p>

<p>The optional @(':parents'), @(':short'), and @(':long') keywords are as in
@(see defxdoc).  Typically you only need to specify @(':parents'), perhaps
implicitly with @(see xdoc::set-default-parents), and suitable documentation
will be automatically generated for @(':short') and @(':long').  If you don't
like this documentation, you can supply your own @(':short') and/or @(':long')
to override it.</p>

<p>The optional @(':prepwork') may provide a list of event forms that are
submitted just before the generated events.  These are preparatory events,
e.g. local lemmas to help prove @(':elementp-of-nil').</p>

<h3>Pluggable Architecture</h3>

<p>Beginning in ACL2 6.5, deflist no longer hard-codes the set of theorems to
be produced about every list recognizer.  Instead, @('def-listp-rule') forms
pertaining to a generic list recognizer called @('element-list-p') are used as
templates and instantiated for each deflist invocation.  These forms may be
scattered throughout various libraries, so the set of books you have loaded
determines the set of rules produced by a deflist invocation.  See @(see
acl2::std/lists/abstract) for more information about these rules and how to
control what theorems are produced by deflist.</p>

<p>\"std/util/deflist.lisp\" includes books that compose a set of rules to
instantiate that should be more or less backward compatible with the theorems
produced by deflist in ACL2 6.4 and previous.  \"std/util/deflist-base.lisp\"
includes a much more basic set of rules.</p>

<h3>Support for Other Events</h3>

<p>Deflist implements the same @('///') syntax as other macros like @(see
define).  This allows you to put related events near the definition and have
them included in the automatic documentation.  As with define, the new
recognizer is enabled during the @('///') section.  Here is an example:</p>

@({
 (deflist even-integer-list-p (x)
   (even-integer-p x)
   :true-listp t
   ///
   (defthm integer-listp-when-even-integer-list-p
     (implies (even-integer-list-p x)
              (integer-listp x))))
})

<p>Deprecated.  The optional @(':rest') keyword was a precursor to @('///').
It is still implemented, but its use is now discouraged.  If both @(':rest')
and @('///') events are used, we arbitrarily put the @(':rest') events
first.</p>

<p>Deprecated.  The optional @(':already-definedp') keyword can be set if you
have already defined the function.  This was previously useful when you wanted
to generate the ordinary @('deflist') theorems without generating a @('defund')
event, e.g., because you are dealing with mutually recursive recognizers.  We
still accept this option for backwards compatibility but it is useless, because
@('deflist') is now smart enough to notice that the function is already
defined.</p>")

(defxdoc strict-list-recognizers
  :parents (deflist)
  :short "Should your list recognizers require @('nil')-terminated lists?"

  :long "<p>Here are two ways that you could write a list recognizer:</p>

<p>The \"strict\" way:</p>

@({
   (defun foo-listp (x)
     (if (atom x)
         (not x)
       (and (foop (car x))
            (foo-listp (cdr x)))))
})

<p>The \"loose\" way:</p>

@({
   (defun foo-listp (x)
     (if (atom x)
         t
       (and (foop (car x))
            (foo-listp (cdr x)))))
})

<p>The only difference is that in the base case, the strict recognizer requires
X to be NIL, whereas the loose recognizer allows X to be any atom.</p>

<p>By default, the recognizers introduced by @(see deflist) follow the loose
approach.  You can use the @(':true-listp') option to change this behavior, and
instead introduce a strict recognizer.</p>

<p>Why in the world would we use a loose recognizer?  Well, there are
advantages to either approach.</p>

<p>The strict approach is certainly more clear and less weird.  It is nice that
a strict recognizer always implies @(see true-listp).  And it makes EQUAL more
meaningful when applied to FOO-LISTP objects.</p>

<p>That is, when FOO-LISTP is strict, there is only one FOO-LISTP that has
length 3 and whose first three elements are (A B C).  However, when FOO-LISTP
is loose, there are infinitely many lists like this, and the only difference
between them is their final cdr.</p>

<p>This nicer equality behavior makes the strict approach especially appealing
when you are building new data types that include FOO-LISTP components, and
you'd like to just reuse EQUAL instead of having new equivalence relations for
each structure.</p>

<p>But the loose approach more nicely follows the @(see list-fix) convention:
\"a function that takes a list as an argument should coerce the final-cdr to
NIL, and produce the same result regardless of the final cdr.\" More formally,
you might say that F respects the list-fix convention when you can prove</p>

@({
   (defcong list-equiv equal (f ... x ...) n)
})

<p>Where list-equiv is equality up to the final cdr, e.g.,</p>

@({
   (list-equiv x y) = (equal (list-fix x) (list-fix y))
})

<p>Many functions follow this convention or something similar to it, and
because of this there are sometimes nicer theorems about loose list recognizers
than about strict list recognizers.  For instance, consider @(see append).  In
the loose style, we can prove:</p>

@({
   (equal (foo-listp (append x y))
          (and (foo-listp x)
               (foo-listp y)))
})

<p>In the strict style, we have to prove something uglier, e.g.,</p>

@({
   (equal (foo-listp (append x y))
          (and (foo-listp (list-fix x))
               (foo-listp y)))
})

<p>There are many other nice theorems, but just as a few examples, each of
these theorems are very nice in the loose style, and are uglier in the strict
style:</p>

@({
   (equal (foo-listp (list-fix x))
          (foo-listp x))

   (equal (foo-listp (rev x))
          (foo-listp x))

   (equal (foo-listp (mergesort x))
          (foo-listp x))

   (implies (and (subsetp-equal x y)
                 (foo-listp y))
            (foo-listp x))
})

<p>@(see deflist) originally came out of @(see acl2::milawa), where I
universally applied the loose approach, and in that context I think it is very
nice.  It's not entirely clear that loose recognizers are a good fit for ACL2.
Really one of the main objections to the loose style is: ACL2's built-in list
recognizers use the strict approach, and it can become irritating to keep track
of which recognizers require true-listp and which don't.</p>")
