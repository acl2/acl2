  :parents (std/util)
  :short "Introduce a record structure, like a @('struct') in C."

  :long "<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Defaggregate introduces a recognizer, constructor, and accessors for a new
record-like structure.  It is similar to @('struct') in C or @('defstruct') in
Lisp.</p>

<p>Basic example:</p>

@({
 (defaggregate employee     ;; structure name
   (name salary position)   ;; fields
   :tag :employee           ;; options
   )
})

<p>This example would produce:</p>

<ul>
 <li>A recognizer, @('(employee-p x)'),</li>
 <li>A constructor, @('(employee name salary position)'),</li>
 <li>An accessor for each field, e.g., @('(employee->name x)'),</li>
 <li>An extension of @(see b*) to easily destructure these aggregates,</li>
 <li>Macros for making and changing aggregates,
   <ul>
    <li>@('(make-employee :name ... :salary ...)')</li>
    <li>@('(change-employee x :salary ...)')</li>
   </ul></li>
 <li>Basic theorems relating these new functions.</li>
</ul>

<p>General form:</p>

@({
 (defaggregate name
   Fields
   [Option]*              ;; i.e., :keyword value
   [/// other-events])    ;; optional, starts with the symbol ///
})

<p>The @('name') acts like a prefix the function and theorem names we generate
will be based on this name.</p>

<p>The @('Fields') describe what fields each instance of the structure will
have.  The example above shows only the very simplest syntax, but fields can
also have well-formedness requirements, documentation, etc.; see below.</p>

<p>The @('Option')s control various settings on the structure, and many options
are described below.  Options can actually come before or after the fields (or
both).</p>

<p>The @('other-events') is just a place for arbitrary other events to be put,
as in @(see define).  This is mainly intended as a book structuring device, to
allow you to keep related theorems near your aggregate.</p>


<h3>Structure Tags</h3>

<p>The @(':tag') of every aggregate must either be:</p>

<ul>

<li>A keyword symbol that typically shares its name with the name of the
aggregate, e.g., in the \"employee\" aggregate the tag is @(':employee');
or</li>

<li><tt>nil</tt>, to indicate that you want a <b>tagless</b> aggregate.</li>

</ul>

<p>How are tags used?  Each instance of a tagged aggregate will be a cons tree
whose car is the tag.  This requires some overhead&mdash;one cons for every
instance of the aggregate&mdash;but allows us to compare tags to differentiate
between different kinds of aggregates.  A tagless aggregate avoids this
overhead, but you give up the ability to easily distinguish different kinds of
tagless aggregates from one another.</p>

<p>To avoid introducing many theorems about @('car'), we use an alias named
@(see tag).  Each tagged @('defaggregate') results in three tag-related
theorems:</p>

<ol>
<li>Tag of constructor:
@({
 (defthm tag-of-example
   (equal (tag (example field1 ... fieldN))
          :example))
})</li>

<li>Tag when recognized:
@({
 (defthm tag-when-example-p
   (implies (example-p x)
            (equal (tag x) :example))
   :rule-classes ((:rewrite :backchain-limit-lst 0)
                  (:forward-chaining)))
})</li>

<li>Not recognized when tag is wrong:
@({
 (defthm example-p-when-wrong-tag
   (implies (not (equal (tag x) :example))
            (equal (example-p x)
                   nil))
   :rule-classes ((:rewrite :backchain-limit-lst 1)))
})</li>
</ol>

<p>These theorems seem to perform well and settle most questions regarding the
disjointness of different kinds of aggregates.  In case the latter rules become
expensive, we always add them to the @('tag-ruleset'), so you can disable this
<see topic='@(url acl2::rulesets)'>ruleset</see> to turn off almost all
tag-related reasoning.</p>


<h3>Syntax of Fields</h3>

<p>To describe the aggregate's fields, you can make use of @(see
extended-formals) syntax.  This syntax means that fields can be optional and
use keyword/value options.  One can also use this syntax to describe a
particular field of an aggregate -- by providing documentation or specifying a
predicate that the field must satisfy.  Here is an example:</p>

@({
 (defaggregate employee

   ((name   \"Should be in Lastname, Firstname format\"
            stringp :rule-classes :type-prescription)

    (salary \"Annual salary in dollars, nil for hourly employees\"
            (or (not salary) (natp salary))
            :rule-classes :type-prescription)

    (rank \"Employee rank.  Can be empty.\"
          (implies rank (and (characterp rank)
                             (alpha-char-p rank))))

    (position (and (position-p position)
                   (salary-in-range-for-position-p salary position))
              :default :peon))

   :tag :employee)
})

<p>The \"guard\" for each field plays three roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a guard on the constructor</li>
<li>It is a well-formedness requirement enforced by the recognizer</li>
<li>It is a theorem about the return type of the accessor.</li>
</ul>

<p>The return-type theorem requires some special attention.  By default, the
return-type theorem is an ordinary @(see acl2::rewrite) rule.  When this is not
appropriate, e.g., for @('name') above, you may wish to use a different
@(':rule-classes') option.</p>

<p>The embedded @(see xdoc) documentation gets incorporated into the
documentation for the aggregate in a sensible way.</p>

<p>The @(':default') value only affects the Make macro (see below).</p>

<h3>Options</h3>

<h4>Legibility</h4>

<p>By default, an aggregate is represented in a <i>legible</i> way, which means
the fields of each instance are laid out in an alist.  When such an object is
printed, it is easy to see what the value of each field is.</p>

<p>However, the structure can be made <i>illegible</i>, which means it will be
packed into a cons tree of minimum depth.  For instance, a structure whose
fields are @('(foo bar baz)') might be laid out as @('((tag . foo) . (bar
. baz))').  This can be more efficient because the structure has fewer
conses.</p>

<p>We prefer to use legible structures because they can be easier to understand
when they arise in debugging and proofs.  For instance, compare:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Legible: @('(:point3d (x . 5) (y . 6) (z . 7))')</li>
 <li>Illegible: @('(:point3d 5 6 . 7)')</li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, illegible structures have a more consistent structure,
which can occasionally be useful.  It's usually best to avoid reasoning about
the underlying structure of an aggregate.  But, sometimes there are exceptions
to this rule.  With illegible structures, you know exactly how each object will
be laid out, and for instance you can prove that two @('point3d') structures
will be equal exactly when their components are equal (which is not a theorem
for legible structures.)</p>

<p>A middle ground between legibility and illegibility is to use @(':legiblep
:ordered'), which still uses an alist representation for readability, but
requires a strict ordering and that no other keys be present.  Such structures
provide the same regularity benefits as illegible structures, and performance
between that of ordinary legible and illegible structures.</p>

<h4>Honsed Aggregates</h4>

<p>By default, @(':hons') is nil and the constructor for an aggregate will
build the object using ordinary conses.  However, when @(':hons') is set to
@('t'), we instead always use @(see hons) when building these aggregates.</p>

<p>Honsing is only appropriate for some structures.  It is a bit slower than
consing, and should typically not be used for aggregates that will be
constructed and used in an ephemeral manner.</p>

<p>Because honsing is somewhat at odds with the memory-inefficiency of legible
structures, @(':hons t') implies @(':legiblep nil').</p>

<h4>Other Options</h4>

<dl>

<dt>:mode</dt>

<dd>Mode for the introduced functions -- must be either @(':program') or
@(':logic').  Defaults to the current @(see acl2::defun-mode).</dd>

<dt>:already-definedp</dt>

<dd>Advanced option that may be useful for mutually-recursive recognizers.
This means: generate all ordinary @('defaggregate') functions and theorems
<i>except</i> for the recognizer.  For this to work, you have to have already
defined a \"compatible\" recognizer.</dd>

<dt>:parents, :short, :long</dt>

<dd>These options are as in @(see xdoc).  Whatever you supply for @(':long')
will follow some automatically generated documentation that describes the
fields of the aggregate.</dd>

<dt>:extra-field-keywords</dt>

<dd>Advanced option for people who are writing extensions of @('defaggregate').
This tells defaggregate to tolerate (and ignore) certain additional keywords in
its fields.  The very advanced user can then inspect these fields after
submitting the aggregate, and perhaps use them to generate additional
events.</dd>

<dt>:verbosep</dt>

<dd>You can use @(':verbosep t') to turn off output hiding.  This option is
generally meant for debugging failures in defaggregate.</dd>

<dt>:rest</dt>

<dd>This option is deprecated.  Please use the new @('///') syntax, instead.</dd>

</dl>


<h3>Dependent Requirements</h3>

<p>The embedded \"guard\" in each extended formal allows you to naturally
express simple requirements, e.g., @('arity') should be a natural and @('args')
should be an @('true-listp').  But what if you need something more like <a
href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type'>dependent types</a>, e.g.,
say that @('arity') is supposed to always match the length of args?</p>

<p>It's valid to refer to other fields within the guards of an embedded formal,
so one way we could write this would be, e.g.,:</p>

@({
    (defaggregate mytype
       ((arity natp :rule-classes :type-prescription)
        (args  (and (true-listp args)
                    (equal (len args) arity)))))
})

<p>This is perfectly valid, but you may sometimes prefer not to embed these
dependent requirements directly in the fields.  For instance, in the example
above, the result-type theorem about @('args') becomes two @(see acl2::rewrite)
rules.  It would probably be better for the @('true-listp') part to be a @(see
acl2::type-prescription) rule.  But the @('len') requirement doesn't make sense
as a @(':type-prescription').</p>

<p>To work around this, you could use an explicit, compound @(':rule-classes')
form with separate @(':corollary') theorems.  This gets very ugly, because you
have to write out each corollary in full, e.g.,:</p>

@({
    (defaggregate mytype
      ((arity natp :rule-classes :type-prescription)
       (args  (and (true-listp args)
                   (equal (len args) arity))
              :rule-classes
              ((:type-prescription :corollary
                                   (implies (force (mytype-p x))
                                            (true-listp (mytype->args x))))
               (:rewrite :corollary
                         (implies (force (mytype-p x))
                                  (equal (len (mytype->args x))
                                         (mytype->arity x))))))))
})

<p>So you may instead prefer to use the alternate @(':require') syntax.
In this case, we would have:</p>

@({
     (defaggregate mytype
       ((arity natp :rule-classes :type-prescription)
        (args  true-listp :rule-classes :type-prescription))
       :require
       ((len-of-mytype->args (equal (len args) arity))))
})

<p>This would result in an ordinary @(see acl2::type-prescription) return-type
theorems for both @('arity') and @('args'), and a separate rewrite rule to deal
with the length dependency:</p>

@({
     (defthm len-of-mytype->args
       (implies (force (mytype-p x))
                (equal (len (mytype->args x))
                       (mytype->arity x))))
})

<p>The general form of each @(':require') form is:</p>

@({   (theorem-name conclusion [:rule-classes ...])  })

<p>Where @('conclusion') may mention any of the fields of the aggregate.  Each
requirement becomes a guard for the constructor, a well-formedness requirement
in the recognizer, and a theorem about the accessors of your structure, exactly
like the simple requirements on each field.</p>


<h3>Make and Change Macros</h3>

<p>Direct use of the constructor is discouraged.  Instead, we introduce two
macros with every aggregate.  The @('make') macro constructs a fresh aggregate
when given values for its fields:</p>

@({
 (make-example :field1 val1 :field2 val2 ...)
    -->
 (example val1 val2 ...)
})

<p>The @('change') macro is similar, but is given an existing object as a
starting point.  It may be thought of as:</p>

@({
 (change-example x :field2 val2)
    -->
 (make-example :field1 (example->field1 x)
               :field2 val2
               :field3 (example->field3 x)
               ...)
})

<p>There are some strong advantages to using these macros instead of calling
the constructor directly.</p>

<ul>

<li>The person writing the code does not need to remember the order of the
fields</li>

<li>The person reading the code can see what values are being given to which
fields.</li>

<li>Fields whose value should be @('nil') (or some other @(':default')) may be
omitted from the <i>make</i> macro.</li>

<li>Fields whose value should be left alone can be omitted from the
<i>change</i> macro.</li>

</ul>

<p>These features make it easier to add new fields to the aggregate later on,
or to rearrange fields, etc.</p>


<h3>Integration with @(see b*)</h3>

<p>Defaggregate automatically introduces a pattern binder that integrates into
@('b*').  This provides a concise syntax for destructuring aggregates.  For
instance:</p>

@({
 (b* ((bonus-percent 1/10)
      ((employee x)  (find-employee name db))
      (bonus         (+ (* x.salary bonus-percent)
                        (if (equal x.position :sysadmin)
                            ;; early christmas for me, har har...
                            (* x.salary 2)
                          0))))
   bonus)
})

<p>Can loosely be thought of as:</p>

@({
 (b* ((bonus-percent 1/10)
      (temp          (find-employee name db))
      (x.name        (employee->name temp))
      (x.salary      (employee->salary temp))
      (x.position    (employee->position temp))
      (bonus         (+ (* x.salary bonus-percent)
                        (if (equal x.position :sysadmin)
                            ;; early christmas for me, har har...
                            (* x.salary 2)
                          0))))
   bonus)
})

<p>For greater efficiency in the resulting code, we avoid binding components
which do not appear to be used, e.g., we will not actually bind @('x.name')
above.</p>

<p>Detecting whether a variable is needed at macro-expansion time is inherently
broken because we can't truly distinguish between function names, macro names,
variable names, and so forth.  It is possible to trick the binder into
including extra, unneeded variables, or into optimizing away bindings that are
necessary.  In such cases, the ACL2 user will be presented with either \"unused
variable\" or \"unbound variable\" error.  If you can come up with a
non-contrived example where this is really a problem, we might consider
developing some workaround, perhaps extended syntax that lets you suppress the
optimization altogether.</p>

<h5>Extra Binder Names</h5>

<p>You can instruct the @(see b*) binder to understand additional, \"derived\"
fields for certain structures.</p>

<p>Example.  Suppose we are dealing with @('student') structures that have
separate @('firstname') and @('lastname') fields.  We might find that we often
want to use the student's full name.  We can explain to the @(see b*) binder
that we want it to understand the syntax @('x.fullname') by giving the
@(':extra-binder-names') argument.</p>

@({
   (defaggregate student
     ((firstname stringp)
      (lastname  stringp)
      (grade     natp))
    :extra-binder-names (fullname))
})

<p>When we do this, the @(see b*) binder will look for occurrences of
@('x.fullname') and, if any are found, it will bind them to
@('(student->fullname x)').  For this to be work at all, we have to define this
function ourselves, e.g.,:</p>

@({
   (define student->fullname ((x student-p))
     :returns (fullname stringp :rule-classes :type-prescription)
     (str::cat (student->firstname x)
               \" \"
               (student->lastname x)))
})

<p>Once we do this, we can freely write @('x.fullname') wherever we previously
would have had to call @('(student->fullname x)').  For instance:</p>

@({
    (b* ((fred (make-student :firstname \"Fredrick\"
                             :lastname \"Flintstone\"
                             :grade 7))
        ((student fred)))
      (str::cat \"Fred's full name is \" fred.fullname \".\"))
})

<p>Nicely produces @('\"Fred's full name is Fredrick Flintstone\"').</p>")

;; <h4>Debug-mode (@(':debugp') parameter)</h4>

;; <p>When set, adds calls of @('cw') that print the aggregate's data members that
;; fail the predicate test.  This can be used to help debug executions whose
;; guards were defined using predicates defined with defaggregate.  Note that the
;; defined predicate can be called many times, even during proofs, so the use of
;; @(':debugp') can result in a large amount of extra output.</p>

;; The remainder of this file just introduces the defaggregate macro.  We never
;; care about reasoning about these functions, so we go ahead and implement
;; them in program mode.
