(defxdoc defval
  :parents (std/util defconst)
  :short "An replacement for @(see defconst) with @(see xdoc) integration."

  :long "<h5>Basic Example</h5>

@({
    (defval *defval-example-number*
      :parents (defval)
      :short \"Example of a constant for @(see defval).\"
      :long \"<p>This number is not very important.</p>\"
      (fib 5))
})

<p>This is equivalent to just doing a @(see defxdoc) followed by a @(see
defconst), except that the @(':long') string will be automatically extended
with the defining event for @('*defval-example-number*').</p>

<h5>General Form</h5>

@({
    (defval *name*
      [keyword options]
      body                 ;; defining expression
      [/// other events])

    Option          Default
      :parents        nil
      :short          nil
      :long           nil
      :showdef        t
      :showval        nil
      :prepwork       nil
})

<p>The @(':parents'), @(':short'), and @(':long') options are as in @(see
defxdoc).  Typically you should specify at least @(':parents'), perhaps
implicitly with @(see xdoc::set-default-parents), to get bare-bones
documentation put into your manual in the right place.</p>

<p>The @(':showdef') and @(':showval') options control what kind of
documentation will be added to your @(':long') section, if any.  These options
are independent, i.e., you can say that you want either, both, or neither kinds
of automatic documentation.</p>

<p>When @(':showdef') is enabled, which is the default, @('defval') will
automatically extend your @(':long') string with a the <i>definition</i> of the
constant.  For instance, here's what this looks like for
@('*defval-example-number*'):</p>

<box>
@(def *defval-example-number*)
</box>

<p>In contrast, when @(':showval') is enabled, @('defval') will extend
@(':long') with the <i>value</i> of your constant, e.g.,</p>

<box>
<p><b>Value:</b></p>
@(`(:code *defval-example-number*)`)
</box>

<p>The optional @(':prepwork') argument can be used to put arbitrary events
before the constant.  This could be used, for instance, to define functions
that are going to be used in the definition of the constant.  These events will
be documented as in the usual @(see defsection) style.</p>

<p>The optional @('///') syntax is like that of @(see define).  After the
@('///') you can put related events that should come after the definition.
These events will be included in the documentation, as in @(see
defsection).</p>

<h5>Warning about Large Constants</h5>

<p>Either @(':showdef') or @(':showval') <b>can cause problems</b> when the
printed representation of your constant's definition or value is very large.
Trying to put huge values into the documentation could cause performance
problems when generating or viewing the manual.</p>

<p>This is much more likely to be a problem with @(':showval'), since even very
small definitions like @('(make-list 100000)') can produce large values.
Because of this, @('defval') disables @(':showval') disabled by default.</p>

<p>This is unlikely to be a problem for @(':showdef') when you are writing your
own @('defval') forms.  However, if you are using @(see make-event) or other
macros to generate @('defval') forms, you will need to be careful.</p>")
