(defsection tag
  :parents (defaggregate)
  :short "Get the tag from a tagged object."

  :long "<p>The @('tag') function is simply an alias for @('car') that is
especially meant to be used for accessing the <i>tag</i> of a <i>tagged
object</i>.</p>

<p>When new types are introduced by macros such as @(see defaggregate), @(see
fty::defprod), @(see fty::deftagsum), etc., they may be tagged.  When a type is
tagged, its objects have the form @('(tag . data)'), where the @('tag') says
what kind of object is being represented (e.g., ``employee'', ``student'',
etc.) and @('data') contains the actual information for this kind of
structure (e.g., name, age, ...).  Tagging objects has some runtime/memory
cost (an extra cons for each object), but makes it easy to tell different kinds
of objects apart by inspecting their tags.</p>

<p>We could (of course) just get the tag with @(see car), but @('car') is a
widely used function and we do not want to slow down reasoning about it.
Instead, we introduce @('tag') as an alias for @('car') and keep it disabled so
that reasoning about the tags of objects does not slow down reasoning about
@('car') in general.</p>

<p>Even so, tag reasoning can occasionally get expensive.  Macros like
@('defaggregate'), @(see fty::defprod), etc., generally add their tag-related
rules to the @('tag-reasoning') ruleset; see @(see acl2::rulesets).  You may
generally want to keep this ruleset disabled, and only enable it when you
really want to use tags to distinguish between objects.</p>

<p>Note: if you are using the @(see fty::fty) framework, it is generally best
to avoid using @('tag') to distinguish between members of the same sum of
products type.  Instead, consider using the custom @('-kind') macros that are
introduced by macros such as @(see fty::deftagsum) and @(see
fty::deftranssum).</p>"

; FIELDS MAPS.
;
; Supported layouts:
;
;   :alist      -- alist-based recognizer (any order permitted)
;   :ordered    -- ordered alist-based recognizer (but still with names)
;   :tree       -- tree-based recognizer (using prod-cons)
;   :fulltree   -- tree based recognizer (using ordinary cons)
;
; A "fields map" is an alist that binds each field name to an s-expression that
; describes how to access it.  For instance, suppose the fields are (A B C).
; For an alist layout structure, the fields map will be:
;
;   ((A . (cdr (assoc 'a <body>)))
;    (B . (cdr (assoc 'b <body>)))
;    (C . (cdr (assoc 'c <body>))))
;
; Where <body> is either X or (cdr X), depending on whether the structure is
; tagless or not.
;
; For structures of other layouts, the (cdr (assoc ...)) terms just get
; replaced with something else, e.g., for a :fulltree structure we might have
; something like (CAR (CDR (CAR <body>))).  For a :tree structure instead of
; CAR/CDR we'll have PROD-CAR/PROD-CDR.  For a :list structure, we'll have
; something essentially like (first <body>), (second <body>), etc., except
; that they'll be the CAR/CDR expansions of that.

;;   works out well, to the actual object being changed.  I.e., if someone
;;   writes (change-foo (blah x y) :a 5 ...), then we will bind
;;
;;      (change-foo (blah x y))
;;
;;   This can't clash with the accessor names we're binding above, because the
;;   change macro can't have the same name as an accessor.  Also LET semantics
;;   ensures that X and Y are not inadvertently bound to foo->a or anything
;;   like that.
;;
;;   3. After the above bindings, invoke the constructor on the "obvious"
