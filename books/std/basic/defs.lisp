<p>Why would you want this?  When you defining a function whose @(see guard)
assumes @('(natp n)'), it is often a good idea to write the function so that it
logically treats non-naturals as 0.  You might generally accomplish this by
rewriting, e.g.,:</p>

@({
    (defun my-function (n ...)
      (declare (xargs :guard (natp n)))
      <body>)

    --->

    (defun my-function (n ...)
      (declare (xargs :guard (natp n)))
      (let ((n (nfix n)))
        <body>))
})

<p>This leads to a nice @(see nat-equiv) @(see congruence) rule.  But since
@(see nfix) has to check whether its argument is a natural number, and that
has some performance cost.</p>

<p>By using @(see lnfix) in place of @('nfix') here, you can get the same
logical definition without this overhead.</p>"

also be @(':baz'), then the guard verification will fail and remind us that we
need to extend @('f') to handle @(':baz') types as well.</p>

<p>If somehow @('(impossible)') is ever executed (e.g., due to program mode
