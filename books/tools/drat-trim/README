This directory used to contain a copy of the DRAT-trim program, by
Marijn J. H. Heule, Warren A. Hunt, Jr., and Nathan Wetzler.

DRAT-trim is often used in conjunction with the SATLINK library, so it
was placed here as a convenience for the user, but it was never
directly integrated into the ACL2 build system, so we decided to
remove it from the repository to prevent bitrot.

If you are looking for DRAT-trim, please go to the official DRAT-trim
website, which is here:
