;;; General comments:

;;; Lisp commenting conventions generally expect ";;;" at the start of a line,
;;; ";;" for indented comments, and ";" at the end of a line after code.  But J
;;; and I typically use ";" instead of ";;;" for the beginning of a line.
;;; Actually ";;" is kind of important to use instead of ";", in order for
;;; control-meta-q and <TAB> to work as expected in Emacs.  But I won't change
;;; any of these, since that would make your diff or (meta-x compare-windows)
;;; more awkward.

  :short "Macro for defining a theorem with a minimal set of hypotheses"
  :long "<p>Suppose E is an admissible event of the form @('(defthm
  name (implies hyps ...))').  Then submitting instead the form @('(remove-hyps
  E)') results in storing a modified version of E, in which @('hyps') has been
  reduced to a minimal set of hypotheses.</p>

 <p>By default, @('remove-hyps') evaluates silently.  To see output from proof
 attempts, add a non-nil optional argument.  For example, for event @('E'), use
 @('(remove-hyps E t)').</p>

 <p>This tool is available in @('tools/remove-hyps.lisp').</p>")

; Possible enhancements include:

; - Printing the final event if hypotheses were eliminated

; - Hiding the output (optionally)

; - Supporting a mode where the new event isn't actually submitted

; - Taking advantage of the :OR feature of make-event to avoid repeated
;   evaluation in some cases

; - Using the :DO-PROOFS feature of make-event to ensure proper operation event
;   when skipping proofs (e.g., calling rebuild)

; - Using the :EXPANSION? feature of make-event to avoid storing the make-event
;   expansion in the certificate, in the common case where no hypotheses are
;   eliminated

; - Further develop documentation, e.g., moving example into it.

; - Moving event destructuring out of remove-hyps to a separate function
;   (in analogy to event construction using make-defthm)

; - Support for other forms besides defthm, such as defrule

; - Consider somehow reporting the correct prover-steps for the final defthm,
;   but still reporting the total prover-steps for the entire remove-hyps
;   invocation (as might be done now -- maybe figure that out and document
;   it).


;; ===================================================================

;; We will be programming with state.
(set-state-ok t)
;; This is a utility and we do not wish to reason about termination.  Moreover,
;; if we were to put all the functions into :logic mode, then either we would
;; need to verify their guards or we would get slower performance (because of
;; the use of executable-counterpart functions).
(program)


;; ============================ HEURISTIC ============================

;; This function provides a limit on the number of steps for any derivative of
;; the original theorem.  We want to avoid a situation where removing some
;; hypothesis places the prover in a state where it is "out to lunch".  This
;; puts an upper bound on the number of prover steps (and hopefully time) the
;; remove-hyps tool will use.  The limit is rather arbitrary and there might
;; well be better limits to use.
(defun remove-hyps-formula-steps (steps)
  (+ 1000 (* 3 steps)))


;; ======================= DEFTHM CONSTRUCTION =======================

;; The dumb-implicate function constructs an "implication" based on a list of
;; hypotheses.  If there are no hypotheses, the result is simply the
;; conclusion.  If there is exactly one hypothesis, we don't need to splice in
;; an "and".  Finally, if there is more than one hypothesis, an "and" is used
;; to conjoin the hypotheses.

;; ======================== DEFTHM EXECUTION =========================

;; The event-steps function performs two tasks.  The first is testing a defthm
;; form for success/failure.  The second is calculating the number of prover
;; steps used in a successful event.  This function returns an error triple (mv
;; erp val state).  In the typical case, erp is nil; then if val is nil then
;; the event failed, and otherwise the event succeeded with val prover steps.
;; If erp is not nil, then all bets are off (but this should be rare).
