; Tau Interval Functions for Basic Arithmetic
; and Proofs of Their Correctness

; J Strother Moore
; Edinburgh, December, 2012

; Abstract

; Consider (+ x y) and suppose we know that the inputs, x and y, are contained
; in two intervals, int1 and int2.  We wish to compute from int1 and int2 an
; interval containing (+ x y).  For example, if x is known to be an INTEGERP
; such that 1 <= x <= 16 and y is a RATIONALP such that 0 < y (with no known
; upper bound), then (+ x y) is known to be in the RATIONALP interval such that
; 1 < (+ x y) (with no known upper bound).  I call the function that takes two
; intervals containing x and y respectively and that returns an interval
; containing (fn x y) a ``bounder'' for fn.
;
; I have developed a book that defines bounders for +, *, /, FLOOR, MOD,
; LOGAND, LOGNOT, LOGIOR, LOGORC1, LOGEQV, LOGXOR, EXPT2, and ASH.  The book
; proves the correctness of each bounder.  In future work I hope to extend ACL2
; so that users can define and verify bounders to improve the tau system.  The
; present work is an exploration of the shape and content of such bounder
; theorems.  Ideally, the present book would just become part of an arithmetic
; package and not be built into ACL2.

; Our bounder definitions (and hence their correctness proofs) fall into one of
; two different styles.  The first definitional style is just straightforward
; case analysis and arithmetic and so the proof follows the usual ACL2 style of
; definitional expansion and use of the arithmetic-5 library.  This first style
; of proof can generate a lot of cases.  For example, the proof that the
; bounder for products is correct generates over 40,000 subgoals.  This is due
; to a variety of issues including the myriad combinations of choices for the
; intervals containing the inputs x and y (e.g., are they open or closed,
; finite or not, over what domains?), as well as the case analysis necessary to
; compute the bounds.  See the definition of tau-bounder-* below.

; In the second style, the bounders are defined in terms of previously verified
; bounders.  For example,

; (LOGIOR X Y) = (LOGNOT (LOGAND (LOGNOT X) (LOGNOT Y)))

; Thus, we can bound LOGIOR by composing already verified bounders and we can
; verify the LOGIOR bounder by exploiting the proved properties of those
; earlier bounders.  However, making this second proof style work imposes
; additional constraints on the correctness theorems and how they are stored as
; rules.

; The book concludes with an essay On the Accuracy of the LOGAND Bounder.

; Some Technical Details

; In this work, an interval is a data structure, constructed by make-tau-interval,
; containing five fields that are named the ``domain,'' the ``lower bound
; relation,'' the ``lower bound,'' the ``upper bound relation,'' and the
; ``upper bound.''  These fields are accessed by interval-dom, interval-lo-rel,
; interval-lo, interval-hi-rel, and interval-hi.  The actual shape of the data
; structure is the same as for a tau-interval in the ACL2 source code:

; (defrec tau-interval (domain (lo-rel . lo) . (hi-rel . hi)) t).

; However, in the source code tau-intervals are constructed by the macro make
; and accessed by the macro access, which expand to raw conses, cars, and cdrs
; for efficiency.  I chose to introduce a named constructor and accessors to
; make it easier to hang lemmas on them during correctness proofs for bounders.
; But the named functions work on exactly the same data structures and can be
; applied to build and access ACL2's tau-intervals.

; An interval domain must be one of INTEGERP, RATIONALP, ACL2-NUMBERP, or nil,
; the last indicating that there is no restriction.  An interval relation is a
; Boolean, where nil means the relation is ``<='' and t means the relation is
; ``<.''  That is, nil means ``weak inequality'' and t means ``strong
; inequality.''  The upper and lower bounds are either nil, meaning no such
; bound is known, or an explicit rational.  Symbolic bounds are not allowed.
; For example,

; (make-tau-interval 'RATIONALP  t -1/2 nil 1)

; denotes the interval containing x such that

; (rationalp x) & -1/2 < x <= 1.

; There are two other constraints on well-formed interval.  First, if the two
; bounds, lo and hi, of an interval are non-nil, then lo <= hi.  Second, if the
; domain of an interval is INTEGERP then the relations must be weak and the
; bounds must be integers.  That is, if x is known to be an INTEGERP such that
; 1/2 < x < 11/2 then instead of creating the (illegal) interval

; (make-tau-interval 'INTEGERP T 1/2 T 11/2)

; one must create

; (make-tau-interval 'INTEGERP NIL 1 NIL 5)

; Of course, (make-tau-interval 'RATIONALP T 1/2 T 11/2) is a perfectly legal
; interval.

; These constraints are formalized in the predicate intervalp below.

; To say that x is ``in'' an interval, int, is (in-tau-intervalp x int), formalized
; below.

; The correctness theorem for the bounder function for addition, which is
; called tau-bounder-+, is given below and suggests the shape of all bounder
; correctness theorems here.

; (implies (and (tau-intervalp int1)
;               (tau-intervalp int2)
;               (or (equal (tau-interval-dom int1) 'integerp)
;                   (equal (tau-interval-dom int1) 'rationalp))
;               (or (equal (tau-interval-dom int2) 'integerp)
;                   (equal (tau-interval-dom int2) 'rationalp))
;               (in-tau-intervalp x int1)
;               (in-tau-intervalp y int2))
;          (and (tau-intervalp (tau-bounder-+ int1 int2))
;               (in-tau-intervalp (+ x y) (tau-bounder-+ int1 int2))
;               ))

; We envision this being used as follows: when ACL2 is asked to compute the tau
; of (+ x y) it first computes the tau of x and the tau of y.  These tau will
; include (possibly trivially unrestrictive) intervals, say int1 and int2.  An
; invariant of the ACL2 code is that the computed int1 and int2 are well-formed
; intervals that contain the values of x and y respectively.  Thus, the first
; two and last two hypotheses of the correctness theorem are assured.  Next,
; ACL2 should check that the domains of the two computed intervals are each
; either INTEGERP or RATIONALP, which if true satisfies the middle two
; hypotheses.  Thus, ACL2 can then run (tau-bounder-+ int1 int2) and know that
; it returns a well-formed interval that contains the value of (+ x y).  This
; allows it to include that newly computed interval into the tau being computed
; for (+ x y).

; In order to use such correctness theorems in the proofs of other such correctness
; theorems, it is necessary (a) to code the theorems (mainly) as :forward-chaining
; rules, and (b) include in the correctness theorem one additional conclusion, namely

;               (implies (not (equal (tau-interval-dom (tau-bounder-+ int1 int2)) 'integerp))
;                        (equal (tau-interval-dom (tau-bounder-+ int1 int2)) 'rationalp)).

; This additional conclusion, which is not necessary for the imagined use of
; TAU-BOUNDER-+, allows the facts proved about TAU-BOUNDER-+ to be sufficient
; to relieve the hypotheses of other correctness results.

; The reason we code these correctness results mainly as :forward-chaining
; rules has to do with free variables.  The bounder for LOGIOR is
; a composition of the bounders for LOGNOT and LOGAND because:

; (LOGIOR X Y) = (LOGNOT (LOGAND (LOGNOT X) (LOGNOT Y)))

; The correctness of the LOGIOR bounder will introduce:

; (TAU-BOUNDER-LOGNOT
;   (TAU-BOUNDER-LOGAND
;    (TAU-BOUNDER-LOGNOT INT1)
;    (TAU-BOUNDER-LOGNOT INT2)))

; and all we will know is that X is in INT1 and Y is INT2.  By forward chaining
; from those two facts, triggered by the presence in the goal of the trigger
; terms (TAU-BOUNDER-LOGNOT INT2) and (TAU-BOUNDER-LOGAND ...) we can infer:

; (IN-TAU-INTERVALP (LOGNOT X) (TAU-BOUNDER-LOGNOT INT1))

; (IN-TAU-INTERVALP (LOGNOT Y) (TAU-BOUNDER-LOGNOT INT2))

; from one round of forward chaining, and then:

; (IN-TAU-INTERVALP (LOGAND (LOGNOT X) (LOGNOT Y))
;               (TAU-BOUNDER-LOGAND
;                   (TAU-BOUNDER-LOGNOT INT1)
;                   (TAU-BOUNDER-LOGNOT INT2)))

; from a second and then

; (IN-TAU-INTERVALP (LOGNOT (LOGAND (LOGNOT X) (LOGNOT Y)))
;               (TAU-BOUNDER-LOGNOT
;                  (TAU-BOUNDER-LOGAND
;                      (TAU-BOUNDER-LOGNOT INT1)
;                      (TAU-BOUNDER-LOGNOT INT2))))

; from a third.  We discuss the decision to use forward-chaining further in the
; proof of tau-bounder-floor-correct.

; recall our convention that when the bound is infinite, we use the weak
; relation (rel = nil) by default.

; I now implement ``the bounds of the product are the products of the bounds.''

; are negative), then the product of their lower bounds is the upper bound of
; their product, and vice versa.  And if one of the intervals is negative and
; the other is positive, the product of the positive upper bound and the
; negative lower bound is the lower bound of the product, and vice versa.
; After working out a few cases, we asked Robert Krug for an exhaustive case

; Warning: This function uses nil and t respectively to represent negative and

; Given the different representations of the infinities, assume that lo1 <? x
; <? hi1 and lo2 <? y <? hi2, where the ``<?'' relations are controlled,
; respectively, by lo-rel1, hi-rel1, lo-rel2, and hi-rel2.  We wish to
; determine bounds on (* x y).  We return (mv lo-rel lo hi-rel hi).

; If you replace bounds-of-product-<, bounds-of-product-<=, and
; bounds-of-product-* by <, <=, and * respectively below, you get a version of
; this function that works when all the bounds are finite.  Inspection shows
; that this is still a very messy function!  Trying to handle the infinities by
; case splitting is daunting.  (Abstractly, one could specialize the code below
; for each of the 2^8 cases -- each bound is either a finite rational or is
; infinite and each relation is either strict or not -- although one can cut it
; in half by exploiting the commutativity of multiplication.)  That's why we
; extended the basic operations to handle infinities.

; The intellectual bulk of the following definition was derived by Robert
; Krug's, who worked out and verified an exhaustive case analysis.  The proof
; of correctness of his original involved only about 5,000 subgoals whereas the
; proof of correctness of the full-fledged interval-based version involves
; about 40,000.  But the case analysis and bounds is due to Robert.  Thank you
; Robert!

; Here is a theorem (and proof hint) establishing the correctness of the
; bounds-of-product function.  The version of this theorem in which all bounds
; are finite is due to Robert Krug although we have changed some function names
; and introduced our conventional rel flag (of opposite parity than Robert's
; closedp).

; This theorem is a good application for ACL2(p).  If you are running ACL2(p) the
; following two commands are helpful (and are no-ops in ordinary ACL2).

; (set-waterfall-printing :limited)

; We break the usual theorem into two parts: one theorem about the domain and
; the other about the bounds.  The reason is that the bounds theorem breaks in
; the special cases that x and/or y is INTEGERP instead of just RATIONALP.
; This is because of some idiosyncracies of arithmetic-5's handling of
; non-linear.

; / -- the reciprocal operator

; The reason we care about this case is that we wish to bound (floor x y).  We
; know (floor x y) <= x/y which is (* x (/ y)), and we know how to bound a
; product.  So what remains is how to bound the reciprocal of y given the
; bounds on y.

; If x occupies a finite rational interval that lies STRICTLY above or below 0,
; e.g.,
;                     0 < lo <? x <? hi
; or
;     lo <? x <? hi < 0

; then we can bound (/ x) by inverting and switching the bounds of x:

;  (/ hi) <? (/ x) <? (/ lo)

; However, things are more complicated if x can take on the value 0, either
; because it is bounded weakly above or below 0 or because the interval spans
; 0.  If a rational interval includes 0 then (/ x) cannot be bounded in either
; direction: as x approaches 0 from above, (/ x) becomes infinitely positive;
; as x approaches 0 from below, (/ x) becomes infinitely negative.  (These
; observations depend on x being allowed to take on any rational value.)  What
; happens if one of the endpoints of the interval is 0?  For example what is
; the range of (/ x) if 0 <= x <= 7?  One might think it is 1/7 <= (/ x) <=
; infinity.  But in fact it is 0 <= (/ x) <= infinity because when x = 0, (/ x)
; is (unfortunately) 0 rather than infinity.

; If x is limited to the integers, the situation is more interesting:
; -1 <= (/ x) <= 1 for integral values of x.

; This is the first of our proofs in the ``second style.''  The idea is not to
; re-expose the (horrendous) details of tau-bounder-* or any of the other
; pre-verified bounders.  We want the proof to appeal to their correctness
; proofs.  With that in mind, we disable the functions concerned (see the e/d
; below).  We disable the executable-counterpart of make-tau-interval so that
; constant intervals, like (make-tau-interval 'integerp nil nil nil nil) which
; arises in one case above), don't block our use of the intervalp-make-tau-interval
; and in-tau-intervalp-make-tau-interval rules.

; The idea in these second style proofs is that the new bounder,
; tau-bounder-floor expands to expose a composition of old bounders and/or
; make-tau-intervals.  Then the previously proved results apply to the resulting
; intervalp, in-tau-intervalp, and interval-dom expressions which are now applied
; to previously verified bounders.

; However, there is a problem.  The (in-tau-intervalp (make-tau-interval ...))
; exposed by the expansion of tau-bounder-floor below will lead us to the
; goal (among others):

; (FLOOR X Y) <= (TAU-INTERVAL-LO (TAU-BOUNDER-* INT1 (TAU-BOUNDER-/ INT2))).

; This particular goal is a bit tricky because it involves an ``extra step,'' namely
; knowing that (floor x y) <= (* x (/ y)), which is known to arithmetic-5.  So let's
; simplify the discussion by assuming that step is taken care of.  How do we prove
; the resulting:

; (* X (/ Y)) <= (TAU-INTERVAL-LO (TAU-BOUNDER-* INT1 (TAU-BOUNDER-/ INT2))).

; where we know that X is in INT1 and Y is in INT2.

; The relevant lemma about tau-bounder-* concludes with:

; (in-tau-intervalp (* x y) (tau-bounder-* int1 int2))

; From this fact we could conclude

; (IN-TAU-INTERVALP (* X (/ Y)) (TAU-BOUNDER-* INT1 (TAU-BOUNDER-/ INT2))) [1]

; and from there we could get an inequality relating (* X (/ Y)) to the
; INTERVAL-LO of the TAU-BOUNDER-*.  But since [1] isn't in the theorem
; and isn't a subgoal, we have to somehow create it and the only way I can
; think of to do that is forward-chain triggered by a term that will be in
; the problem, namely:

; (TAU-BOUNDER-* INT1 (TAU-BOUNDER-/ INT2)).

; But that requires finding choices for the free variables x and y.

; So the general strategy of the ``second style'' of proof is to do everything
; by forward chaining.  From the presence of (TAU-BOUNDER-/ INT2) we forward
; chain to (IN-TAU-INTERVALP (/ Y) (TAU-BOUNDER-/ INT2)), guessing Y by the presence
; of (IN-TAU-INTERVALP Y INT2) given in the problem.  From the presence of
; (TAU-BOUNDER-* INT1 (TAU-BOUNDER-/ INT2)) we forward chain to
; (IN-TAU-INTERVALP (* X (/ Y)) INT1 (TAU-BOUNDER-/ INT2)), guessing X from

; K is either NIL (the appopriate infinity) or a rational.  Consider some

; upper-boundp  rel   meaning    squeezed        k'
; t             t     (<  x k)   (<= x k')       (- (ceiling k 1) 1)

; nil           nil   (<= k x)   (<= k' x)       (ceiling k 1)

; Programming Note: When k is a non-integer rational,
; (- (ceiling k 1) 1) = (floor k 1), and thus
; (+ (floor k 1) 1)   = (ceiling k 1)
; so the table would be:

; Table B: Non-Integer Rational k:

; nil           nil   (<= k x)   (<= k' x)       (ceiling k 1)

; But when k is an integer, the table is:

; Table C: Integer k:
; upper-boundp  rel   meaning    squeezed        k'
; t             t     (<  x k)   (<= x k')       (- k 1)

; nil           nil   (<= k x)   (<= k' x)       k

; We actually code Tables B and C and test which to use with (integerp k),

; Note that (mod x y) can return a complex-rational when its arguments are
; complex-rationals.  The conclusion of the theorem would compare that
; complex-rational to two rationals.  But I don't want to think about that!
; So, we restrict our attention to intervals over the rationals (or integers).
; As a result of this restriction, the domain returned by the general purpose
; bounds-of-mod is the same as that computed by domain-of-sum-or-product, as
; noted in our theorem below.

; -----------------------------------------------------------------
; The Arithmetic-Logical Functions

; The logical functions always take and return integers.  Our theorems require
; this.  We thus know that the relations, e.g., ``lo-rel'' and ``hi-rel'',
; bounding the various quantities are always weak.  Hence, our functions for
; computing bounds and our theorems about those functions don't traffic in
; relations.  For example, ``bounds-of-logand'' takes four argument, the bounds
; on x and y, not eight; it returns two results, not four.  (However, the
; theorems still use (<? nil lo ...), for example, rather than (<= lo ...)
; because lo might be a nil representing negative infinity.)

; To help us keep track of these reduced signatures, we add an ``i'' for
; ``integer'' to the bounds functions and theorem names, e.g.,
; ibounds-for-logand and logand-tau-bounder-ibounds.  The functions concerned
; are:

; LOGAND
; LOGNOT
; LOGIOR
; LOGORC1
; LOGEQV
; LOGXOR
; EXPT2
; ASH

; If others are added, make sure they traffic only in integers!

; -----------------------------------------------------------------
; LOGAND

; We first prove a variety of lemmas to handle special cases.  Some of these
; lemmas restrict the domains of x and y to INTEGERP and some don't.  But our
; main result will apply only to INTEGERP domains, INTEGERP bounds, and weak
; relations.

; By the way, it is known that INTEGERP (logand x y), no matter what x and y
; are.

; If x is in the interval 0 <= minx <= x <= maxx and
;    y is in the interval 0 <= miny <= y <= maxy, then
; then (logand x y) is in
; the interval 0 <= (logand x y) <= (min maxx maxy).

; Note that we can't raise the lower bound because if x and y have no bits in
; common (as in x=4 and y=8), their logand is in fact 0.

; computing logand for each combination.  The threshhold chosen above just
; allows us to compute the bounds on 10-bit x 10-bit logands.  It takes a total
; of 0.066123 seconds to compute the two bounds on intervals of this size,
; running on a 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 Macbook Pro in CCL.  Note also that the
; way we actually compute the minimal and maximal (see bounds-of-logand below)
; is to compute them separately in two passes over the matrix.  We could
; presumably save a little overhead by computing them in one pass.

; On Why We Need the :USE Hint in the Proof of that the ASH Bounder is Correct

; Consider just the proof of the first concluding conjunct above,

; (TAU-INTERVALP (TAU-BOUNDER-ASH INT1 INT2)).

; After opening up, this is:

;  (TAU-INTERVALP (TAU-BOUNDER-FLOOR
;              (TAU-BOUNDER-* INT1
;                              (TAU-BOUNDER-EXPT2 INT2))
;              (MAKE-TAU-INTERVAL 'INTEGERP NIL 1 NIL 1)))

; We mean to prove this by :forward-chaining from the three correctness lemmas
; for FLOOR, *, and EXPT2.  To use the TAU-BOUNDER-FLOOR-CORRECT theorem, we
; need to have derived:

; [1] (tau-intervalp (TAU-BOUNDER-* INT1 (TAU-BOUNDER-EXPT2 INT2)))

; [2] (tau-intervalp (MAKE-TAU-INTERVAL 'INTEGERP NIL 1 NIL 1))

; We could get [2] in one of several ways but we don't pursue those
; improvements because we'd still be blocked from our ultimate ASH goal by the
; problems raised by [1].  But to elaborate slightly on fixing [2], one
; solution would be to add the :forward-chaining rule:

; (defthm make-tau-interval-x-x
;   (implies (integerp x)
;            (and (equal (tau-interval-dom (make-tau-interval 'integerp nil x nil x)) 'integerp)
;                 (tau-intervalp (make-tau-interval 'integerp nil x nil x))
;                 (in-tau-intervalp x (make-tau-interval 'integerp nil x nil x))))
;   :rule-classes ((:forward-chaining :trigger-terms ((make-tau-interval 'integerp nil x nil x)))))

; Alternatively we could rely on the fact that forward-chaining evaluates
; ground terms and [2] is a ground term, but we have (:executable-counterpart
; make-tau-interval) disabled in these ``second style'' proofs so as to simplify
; the application of our basic rules for tearing apart IN-TAU-INTERVALP and
; INTERVALP of MAKE-TAU-INTERVAL expressions.  (If ground MAKE-TAU-INTERVALs are
; evaluated, we'd have to recode some of those rules so that, for example
; (in-tau-intervalp x (cons dom (cons (cons lo-rel lo) (cons hi-rel hi)))) is
; expanded appropriately.)

; But as noted, we don't try to fix [2] because we're still blocked by [1].

; What does it take to get [1]?  To apply tau-bounder-*-correct we need to
; know that its second argument, (TAU-BOUNDER-EXPT2 INT2), is an intervalp
; [which we can get via tau-bounder-expt2-correct] and we need to know that
; the domain of (TAU-BOUNDER-EXPT2 INT2) is either 'INTEGERP or 'RATIONALP.
; Now in fact the domain of (TAU-BOUNDER-EXPT2 INT2) is one of those two, but
; we don't know which.  (If Y is non-negative, the domain is INTEGERP and if Y
; is negative it is RATIONALP -- but this fact, like the fact that
; tau-bounder-* is weak because it doesn't tell us when the product is an
; INTEGERP -- is not proved here.)  But even we had proved this fact, it
; wouldn't help us because we don't know the sign of Y, forward-chaining
; doesn't do case analysis, and forward-chaining cannot propagage disjunctions.
; The only way to win here is to :USE some rule that puts the necessary
; conditions into the theorem and let the simplifier consider the cases.

; This perhaps calls into question the whole ``second style'' of proof, based
; on forward-chaining from previously proved correctness theorems.  However,
; revisit the discussion on the role of forward-chaining in the comment
; preceding tau-bounder-floor-correct.

; On the Accuracy of the LOGAND Bounder
;
; [This essay was written to be somewhat self-contained and so repeats some basic
; facts before getting to the gist of the matter.]
;
; Tau is capable of tracking finite intervals.  For example, suppose x is known
; to be an integer that lies between two known integer constants, e.g., 0 <= x <= 15.
; This information is treated by tau as a ``type'' in the sense that it can
; be propagated by signatures and other rules available to the system.
;
; Suppose the lower and upper bounds of the interval on x are given by the
; integers lox (``low x'') and hix (``high x''), and the bounds on y are
; loy and hiy.  Obviously then, the bounds on (+ x y) are lox+loy and hix+hiy.
; Note that the bounds on (+ x y) are constants, computed by summing the constant
; bounds on the inputs x and y.
;
; In the same fashion, we wish to bound (logand x y).
;
; A little bit of analysis can provide some rough bounds.  For example, if both
; input intervals are non-negative (i.e., 0 <= lox and 0 <= loy), then
; (logand x y) can be no smaller than 0 and no larger than the minimum of hix and
; hiy.  If both input intervals are strictly negative, (logand x y) is negative
; and can be no smaller than
;
; (- (expt 2 (max (shifts-to-all-ones lox)
;                 (shifts-to-all-ones loy))))
;
; and no greater than the minimum of hix and hiy.  Here, shifts-to-all-ones is
; the function that determines how many times its argument must be right
; shifted to produce -1 (and is thus ceiling of the log base 2 of the negative
; of its argument; e.g., (shifts-to-all-ones -9) = 4).
;
; Using this analysis, if -7 <= x <= -1 and -6 <= y <= -2, then
; -8 <= (logand x y) <= -2.
;
; One can similarly work out analytical bounds for when one of the inputs is
; strictly negative and the other is non-negative, and for when both can range
; over both the negatives and non-negatives.
;
; I have worked out such analytical bounds and proved that they are sufficient
; to actually contain all values of the relevant logand expressions.  However,
; my analytical bounds of logand can be quite inaccurate.  [Footnote: I say
; ``my analytical bounds'' because one could probably work out more accurate
; ones and, indeed, I illustrate the approach below but don't pursue it.]
;
; To give an example of the inaccuracy of my bounds, consider a simple case
; where both x and y range over non-negative values.  Analytically we say that
; (logand x y) in this cases ranges from 0 to the minimal of the upper bounds of
; x and y.  This is obvious since logand will only turn some bits off.
;
; But now consider this example:
;
; lox = (+ (expt 2 31) 8)
; hix = (+ (expt 2 31) 8 7)
; loy = (+ (expt 2 30) 8)
; hiy = (+ (expt 2 30) 8 7)  = 1073741839
;
; The analytical answer says 0 <= (logand x y) <= 1073741839.  But actually, we
; can see that 8 <= (logand x y) <= 15.  Thus both our lower analytical bound and
; our upper analytical bound can be wildly inaccurate.
;
; Part of the project of computing bounds for logand was to address the
; inaccuracy of this analysis.  Notice that despite the magnitude of the bounds
; above, there are only 8 possible values of x and 8 possible values of y.
; Hence, there are only 64 combinations and it is straightforward to evaluate
; logand on those 64 combinations to compute the actual bounds.  I call this the
; ``empirical'' method instead of the (my) ``analytical'' method.
;
; Of course, the empirical method cannot be applied to problems beyond a certain
; small size (as measured by the product of the widths of the two input
; intervals).  This size, called the ``empirical threshhold,'' is set currently
; at 1024^2 or 1,048,576.  This allows us to bound 10-bit by 10-bit logands
; perfectly.  The time it takes to compute both the upper and lower bounds for an
; interval of this size is 0.066123 seconds on a Macbook Pro running CCL on an
; 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7.  Of course, we might wish to lower the threshhold to
; avoid the empirical computation if we decide that it is just too expensive in
; actual proofs.  My gut feeling is that since this only happens when we
; encounter LOGANDs, we can probably afford the 10-bit by 10-bit test.
;
; The approach we adopted in tau-bounder-logand is to first determine the size
; of the problem.  If it is small enough, we use the empirical method.
; Otherwise, we use the analytic method.  We call this combined scheme the
; ``heuristic method.''
;
; In tau-bounder-logand-correct, above, I prove that the heuristic bounds are
; logically sufficient:  they are always wide enough to include the right answer.
;
; Two ill-formed questions swirl in my mind.  It would be nice if someone with a
; more analytical mindset (or a sense of having more time!) made the two
; questions more precise so they could actually be answered.  One question is:
; if we didn't use the empirical method to make some of our bounds perfect,
; how bad would it be?  Of course, the example above shows that the error can be
; about as bad as you can imagine.  Indeed, if the two inputs have exactly one
; bit in common, that bit determines both the upper and lower bounds of the interval
; (they're equal) and all the other bits in the two inputs contribute only to the
; size of the error!  But really, how often do these bad cases happen over random
; input intervals?  This clearly has a precise, abstract answer but I haven't
; pursued it.
;
; The second question is: how much more accurate do it get if we use the
; empirical method on the small problems?  This could help us decide whether the
; empirical method is worth its cost.
;
; Of course, the more meaningful cost/benefit question is: how many more
; theorems (that we're likely to run into) would we prove due to the use of the
; empirical method on small problems?  In the absence of an answer to that more
; meaningful question, an accuracy analysis of tau-bounder-logand is sort of
; irrelevant or, at least to me, of secondary importance.  That's why I'm
; satisfied with a proof of correctness and a half-baked experimental
; determination that the empirical methods sort of seems to probably improve
; accuracy by a meaningful amount.
;
; With these apologies, let me now present my experimental setup and results.
;
; Let k be some natural number.  In the tests below, I use k=5, 10, 15, ..., 50.
; I call k the ``radius'' of a test.  In a test of radius k, I consider all
; combinations of two intervals whose upper and lower bounds are between -k and
; k.  I call this the test set.  More precisely, the test set for radius k is the
;
;  {(make-tau-interval 'integerp nil lo nil hi) : (-k <= lo <= k) & (lo <= hi <= k)}
;
; Note: hi must be at least lo for the interval to be legal.
;
; The test for radius k then chooses every possible combination of intervals from
; the test set and assesses the accuracy of the logand bounder, with and without
; the empirical method.
;
; But how do I ``assess accuracy?''  The only way I know is to use the empirical
; method to determine the true bounds of each combination.
;
; Since the number of combinations in a test set increases exponentially with k,
; this experiment gets computationally expensive.  I therefore limit my tests to
; radii below 50. However, if every interval in every test set is small, then
; they'd all fall below the threshhold for using the empirical method and every
; single result of tau-bounder-logand would be perfect.
;
; To deal with this, I set the thresshold artificially low: 100.  That is,
; tau-bounder-logand uses the empirical method only when product of the size of
; the two intervals is less than 10 * 10.  (To run tau-bounder-logand without it
; using the empirical method at all, I set the threshhold to 0.)
;
; My hypothesis is that even with a relatively low threshhold (so that the number
; of combinations handled correctly ``by definition'' becomes increasiningly
; small compared to the number of combinations), the empirical method improves
; accuracy significantly.  Here are my results.  See the Appendix A for the code
; and resulting raw data from which this table is extracted.

;  k   A      H  (E coverage)
;
;  5   65    100 (99)
; 10   60     87 (80)
; 15   61     87 (58)

;
; In column A I show the percentage of the combinations bounded perfectly by the
; analytical method (i.e., with the threshhold set to 0 so that the empirical
; method is not employed).  Note that it seems to hold steady at about 57% as k
; increases.
;
; In column H I show the percentage of the combinations bounded perfectly by the
; heuristic method (which augments the analytical method with the empirical
; method for combinations under the size threshhold of 100).
;
; In parenthesis I show the percentage of the cases covered by the empirical
; method.  For example, when k=50, the heuristic method is perfect 65 percent of
; the time but only 12% of the cases were handled by the empirical method.
;
; What this shows is that the empirical method increases the accuracy even as it
; addresses a smaller percentage of the cases.  Since the empirical method is
; limited to small cases, I suspect this means that the small cases are handled
; inaccurately by the analytical method a disproportionate number of times.

; In this section I show the raw Lisp code and raw data behind the table above.
;
; ; These bounds aren't always very tight.  Let k be some natural number.
; ; Consider every combination of:
;
; ; -k <= lox <= hix <= k and -k <= loy <= hiy <= k
;
; ; and then compute the predicted bounds of logand.  Then, for every x and y in
; ; the given two intervals, compute the actual lo and the actual hi of (logand x
; ; y).  Let dlo be the distances between the actual lo and the predicted lo, and
; ; let dhi be the comparable hi distance.  Sum dlo and dhi to get a measure how
; ; accurate the interval is.  Sum all the measures across all combinations of
; ; input intervals.

; I now discuss briefly the prospects of refining my analysis so that it is
; inherently more accurate.  I am not optimistic but record my thoughts for
; posterity in case somebody wants to pursue it.
;
; Here is an example of a bad case.  The x interval contains only one element.
; The y interval contains 64 elements, so it is easy to compute the empirical
; answer.  The analytical range is 0 to 3392, but the actual range is 3072 to
; 3104.  Furthermore, there are only two points in the actual range: 3072 and
; 3104.  Here is some Common Lisp code to confirm these statements:
;
; (let* ((lox #b10110000100000)
;        (loy #b00110100000000)
;        (hiy #b00110101000000)
;        (hix lox))
;   (mv-let (rel1 lo rel2 hi)
;           (ibounds-of-logand nil lox nil hix nil loy nil hiy)
;           `((lox ,lox)
; 	    (hix ,hix)
; 	    (loy ,loy)
; 	    (hiy ,hiy)
; 	    (,lo --- ,hi)
; 	    (,(find-minimal-logand lox hix loy hiy) ---
; 	      ,(find-maximal-logand lox hix loy hiy))
; 	    (all ,(let ((ans nil))
; 		    (loop for x from lox to hix
; 			  do (loop for y from loy to hiy
; 				   do (or (member-equal (logand x y) ans)
; 					  (setq ans (cons (logand x y) ans)))))
; 		    ans)))))
; This produces:
;
; ((LOX 11296)
;  (HIX 11296)
;  (LOY 3328)
;  (HIY 3392)
;  (0 --- 3392)       ; analytical interval
;  (3072 --- 3104)    ; actual interval
;  (ALL (3104 3072))) ; all possible actual values of (logand x y)
;
; Let's blow up this example to see why the prediction is so hard.  I discuss
; the example in the text below and, in the ``footnotes'', discuss the
; generalization of the example to whole classes of problems.
;
; bits            a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m  n
; pwr            13 12 11 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
;
; lox = hix = #b  1  0  1  1  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0
; loy       = #b  0  0  1  1  0  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
; hiy       = #b  0  0  1  1  0  1  0  1  0  0  0  0  0  0
;
; Note that as y ranges from loy to hiy, we will generate all possible 6-bit
; patterns in bits i through n, stopping when we finally set bit h.  [Footnote:
; In general we won't generate all h-bit patterns, since we start with the
; pattern given by the low h bits of loy and end with the pattern given by the
; low h+1 bits of hiy, but since in this example, loy and hiy both have all 0s
; below bit h, we will generate all patterns.]  Thus, all the y's in the range
; share the same bits above bit h.  Thus, every logand of x and y will be
; non-zero, because x and every y will always share whatever bits all three
; share above bit h.  In this case that is bits c and d, which is 2^11 + 2^10 =
; 3072.  [Footnote: Clearly we could have an arbitrary number of shared bits
; contributing to this lower bound.]  Furthermore, since there is only one x
; and it has only one bit set below bit h, as y varies it the low order h bits
; of (logand x y) will will either be all 0 or all 0 except for 1 in bit i.
; This will mean that the low order h bits of the logand either contribute 0 or
; 2^5 to the value.  This is how the empirical hi is achieved: lo + 2^5 = 3104.
; This accounts for all (both) of the values of the logand.  [Footnote: By
; choosing an x with multiple bits set below bit h we can arrange for multiple
; values to be generated by the logand.  Precisely which values can only be
; determined, I think, by generating each of the h-bit numbers between the low
; h bits of loy and the low h bits of hiy and loganding those patterns with the
; low h bits of x.]
;
; One could over estimate the maximal amount by which lo will be incremented by
; supposing that there exists a combination in y that will select all of the
; lower h bits of x.
;
; But I've decided that trying to get more accurate analytical bounds is not
; worth the effort.  Instead, I'll just go with the empirical approach.  We'll
; see if this is helpful enough.
