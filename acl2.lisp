; This file cannot be compiled because it changes packages in the middle.

; This file, acl2.lisp, (a) builds the packages for the ACL2 system, (b)
; defines the functions for loading and compiling ACL2 and for running code
; verified using ACL2, and (c) makes a couple of checks concerning minor,
; non-CLTL, assumptions that we make about Common Lisps in which ACL2 is to
; run.

;                            CLTL1/CLTL2
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; For the most part, we program in a subset both of CLTL1 and CLTL2.
; However, there are a few places, notably the name of the main
; package for Lisp symbols, where this is impossible.  So we use the
; read conditional #+CLTL2.  If one wishes to run ACL2 under CLTL2,
; execute the following form before commencing compiling or loading:

;        (push :CLTL2 *features*)

; For example, for Allegro and lispworks (respectively) we have the following.

#+(or ansi-cl draft-ansi-cl-2 lispworks clisp ccl)
(push :CLTL2 *features*)

; We use IN-PACKAGE in a way that is consistent with both CLTL1 and
; CLTL2, namely as a macro (i.e., whose argument is not evaluated) for
; switching *package* to an existing package, value ignored.

(in-package #-CLTL2 "USER" #+CLTL2 "COMMON-LISP-USER")

; Avoid warning, at least in Allegro CL, for use of this variable below.  Note
; that it is set to nil using GNUmakefile when ACL2_COMPILER_DISABLED is set.
(defvar *acl2-compiler-enabled*)

; Changes Made in Support of CMU Lisp

; (0) (The following issue with Cmulisp no longer seems to be true, at least
;     as of Version 19e on Linux.)
;     Cmulisp doesn't support EVAL-WHEN.  This meant that in the #+cmu case
;     I had to put down special code to try to do what other lisps do.
;     Generally, this involved just not checking for certain errors (compiling
;     files that weren't supposed to be compiled) in #+cmu that were checked
;     in other lisps.  In one case, namely the initialization of
;     current-acl2-world, it involved a little more.

; (1) cmulisp switches from *standard-input* to *terminal-io* when the input
;     stream reaches eof; our other lisps all exit to the operating system.
;     This means all the batch jobs we submit via make have to be arranged to
;     exit from cmulisp before eof.  This required changing the top-level
;     makefile and the makefiles of all the community books.  I generally put a
;     `:q #+cmu (lisp::quit)' at the end of each workxxx.
;     These could be replaced simply by `:q (acl2::exit-lisp)'.

; (2) Cmulisp checks type assertions at runtime.  I found two of our assertions
;     violated by actual use.  In fmt-char we mistakenly claimed the string's
;     length was less than 101.  This was a typo -- elsewhere in the same
;     function we claimed it was just a fixnum -- apparently caused by
;     copying a type-declaration and failing to edit it thoroughly.  (Another
;     variable was correctly limited to 101.)

;     In maximal-elements1, used in the selection of induction candidates,
;     we claimed (by using int=) that the scores for an induction candidate
;     are integers when in fact they are rationals.

; (3) Evidently, all functions in cmulisp pass the compiled-function-p test.
;     If you defun foo and immediately get its symbol-function you get
;     an object like #<Interpreted function ...>.  If you ask whether
;     this object is a compiled-function-p you get t.  If you compile
;     foo the symbol-function changes to an object like #<Function
;     ...>, which also passes the test.

;     The fact that everything in a symbol-function field looks like a compiled
;     function killed us in an interesting way.  Most locally, it made
;     compile-uncompiled-*1*-defuns write out an empty file of functions to
;     compile, because everything looked compiled already.  But where that
;     really got us was that we use that function to create TMP1.lisp during
;     the bootstrapping.  TMP1.lisp, recall, contains the mechanically
;     generated executable-counterparts of logic mode functions defined in
;     axioms.lisp.  By not generating these we built an image in which the
;     relevant functions were undefined.  Because of the rugged way we invoke
;     them, catching errors and producing a HIDE term if we can't eval them,
;     we survived the certification of many books before we finally got to a
;     proof that couldn't be done without running one of those functions.
;     The proof, in the bdd community books, required evaling (nth -1 nil), which
;     according to the axioms is nil but which we couldn't deduce because
;     ACL2_*1*_COMMON-LISP::NTH was undefined.

;     My fix was to define and use compiled-function-p! instead of the standard
;     compiled-function-p.  The new function has a #+/-cmu split in it.  In the
;     cmu case I ask

;     (not (eq (type-of (symbol-function fn)) 'eval:interpreted-function))

;     So I say fn is compiled if its symbol-function is not an object like
;     #<Interpreted function ...>.

; (4) CMU Lisp does not allow us to "undefine" a macro-function.  That is,
;     one is not permitted to store a nil into the macro-function
;     field because nil is not a function.  We do this when we
;     implement undo.  We handle it by storing a dummy function
;     instead, and change the notion of when a symbol is virgin to
;     recognize the case that its symbol-function or macro-function is
;     the dummy.

; (5) We made a few fixes and cleanups in order to avoid compiler warnings.

  `(optimize #+cltl2 (compilation-speed 0)

; The user is welcome to modify this proclaim form.  For example, in CCL and
; SBCL, where the "full" target does essentially nothing other than note in
; file acl2-status.txt that the system has allegedly been compiled, the
; following procedure works.

;   # Write :COMPILED to acl2-status.txt.
;   make full LISP=ccl

;   # Next, edit acl2r.lisp with the desired variant of *acl2-optimize-form*,
;   # for example as follows.
;   #   (defparameter cl-user::*acl2-optimize-form*
;   #     '(OPTIMIZE (COMPILATION-SPEED 0) (DEBUG 0) (SPEED 0) (SPACE 0)
;   #                (SAFETY 3)))
;   #

;   # Now start CCL and evaluate:

;   (in-package "ACL2")
;   (save-acl2 (quote (initialize-acl2 (quote include-book)

; Consider replacing cmu on the next line with (or cmu sbcl).  The SBCL manual
; says the following, but a quick test with (or cmu sbcl) yielded no smaller
; .core file size and no quicker (mini-proveall).

;   The value of space mostly influences the compiler's decision whether to
;   inline operations, which tend to increase the size of programs. Use the
;   value 0 with caution, since it can cause the compiler to inline operations
;   so indiscriminately that the net effect is to slow the program by causing
;   cache misses or even swapping.

; Safety 1 for CCL has avoided the kernel debugger, e.g. for compiled calls

;                       READING CHARACTERS FROM FILES
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; Files may be viewed as sequences of bytes.  But Lisp can interpret these byte
; sequences as sequences of characters, depending on so-called character
; encodings.

; For example, through about March 2012 the default character encoding in CCL
; was ISO-8859-1, sometimes known as LATIN-1.  When this changed to UTF-8 a
; failure was reported when attempting to certify community book
; books/workshops/2006/cowles-gamboa-euclid/Euclid/fld-u-poly/coe-fld.lisp,
; apparently because of the following line, where the next-to-last character is
; actually an accented `o' sometimes known as
; #\LATIN_SMALL_LETTER_O_WITH_ACUTE, having code 243.  (The CLISP build fails
; if we use that character here, because at this point we have not yet made the
; adjustments to the character encoding that are done below!)

  ;;; Inverso de la primera operacion

; The accented `o' above is encoded as a single byte in LATIN-1 but as two
; bytes in UTF-8.

; Jared Davis then suggested that we explicitly specify ISO-8859-1, which might
; be slightly more efficient for reading files.  Note that GCL (non-Ansi, circa
; 2010 but probably later) only supports ISO-8859-1 as far as we can tell.  We
; follow Jared's suggestion below.  It seems that character encoding for
; reading from files is controlled differently from character encoding for ACL2
; reading from the terminal.  Jared also suggested setting the terminal
; encoding to ISO-8859-1 as well, and showed us how to do that in CCL.  We have
; been unable to figure out how to do that in some other host Lisps, but since
; files are typically shared between users and (of course) ACL2 reading from
; the terminal is not, the encoding for the terminal seems less important than
; for files.

; Even for files, we assert there is no soundness issue, in the sense that for
; maximum trust we expect each user to certify all books from scratch in a
; single environment.  But in practice, users share books (in particular,
; via the community books); so it is desirable to enforce uniform character
; encodings for files.

; The use of latin-1 could in principle cause problems for those whose default
; Emacs buffer encoding is utf-8.  That's in fact the case for us at UT CS, but
; not on one of our Mac laptops as of this writing (April 2012), probably
; because environment variable LANG is en_US.UTF-8 at UT CS.  But ACL2 users
; don't often save Lisp files with nonstandard characters.  If they have
; occasion to do so, they can evaluate

; (setq save-buffer-coding-system 'iso-8859-1)

; in Emacs buffers before saving into files.  This will happen automatically
; for users who load file emacs/emacs-acl2.el into their emacs sessions.

; At any rate, it seems best to standardize file encodings and leave it to
; individuals to cope with editing issues.

; Without further ado, we set the default encoding for files.  Below, we make
; some attempt to do so for the terminal.  We wrap all this into a function,
; because we have found that for sbcl, upon restart we lose the effect of the
; assignment below.  It seems safest then to do these same assignments at
; startup; see the call of the following function in acl2-default-restart.

(defun acl2-set-character-encoding ()

; (Defconst *var* term) is essentially just (defparameter *var* term).  But
; things are made complicated by the desire not to evaluate term unnecessarily.
; Suppose (defconst *var* term) appears in a certified book, say "book.lisp".
; Then when the events in "book.lisp" are processed, a CLTL-COMMAND is executed
; which causes (defconst *var* term) to be evaluated in the underlying raw
; lisp, assigning a value to *var* in Lisp.  But now suppose that the compiled
; file for another book, say "book2.o", is loaded on behalf of include-book.
; If defconst were just defparameter, term would be evaluated again (yielding a
; presumably EQUAL value), which is an unfortunate waste of computation.

; We avoid this in the code below by saving, on the raw Lisp property list of
; *var*, under the key 'REDUNDANT-RAW-LISP-DISCRIMINATOR, a triple, (DEFCONST
; term . val), giving the term we evaluated to produce the setting of the var
; and the value, val, produced.  When a defconst (defconst *var* term) is
; evaluated, we ask whether *var* has a value.  If not, we just proceed
; normally.  But if it has a value, we insist that the discriminator be present
; and appropriate or else we cause a hard error.  By appropriate in this case
; we mean that it be a DEFCONST such that the value produced last time is EQ to
; the current setting of *var*, and moreover, either the old and new DEFCONST
; have the same (EQUAL) term to evaluate or else the new value is EQUAL to the
; old.  The EQ check is meant to provide some safety if the user has manually
; set *var* in raw lisp, as with setq, since the last defconst to it.

; We anticipate that redundant-raw-lisp-discriminator may be used by the
; support functions for other events, e.g., defstobj.  So the value of that
; property is not necessarily (DEFCONST term . val) but may depend on the kind
; of event that stored it.  The reason we put the discriminator on the raw lisp
; property list of *var* rather than looking in the world of *the-live-state*,
; where we could in principle find an event-landmark, is that we execute many
; defconsts in axioms.lisp, before the world processing functions, like
; getprop, are defined and so the defmacro below must expand to code that can
; be executed in a partially booted ACL2.

; With some thought we might be able to avoid the special cases below for which

; like .cert and @expansion.lsp files, i.e., files that may be written by the
; host Lisp (see the call of prin1 in print-object$-ser) but are read by ACL2.
; Perhaps the issue goes away if we are using the serialize reader and writer,
; as must be the case when we install a reader for #\Y.  We may think all this
; through when there is sufficient reason to do so.  For now, the only problem
; pertaining to our handling of dispatch macro characters is in the case of
; CLISP and ACL2(h), since #\Y is already defined in CLISP -- this function
; causes an error when attempting to build ACL2(h) on CLISP.  Since CLISP is
; much slower than the other six host Lisps that we support, and since ACL2(h)

;                       Remarks on *acl2-readtable*
;
;
; Because read-object calls the Common Lisp function read, read-object
; is a function of the values of the Common Lisp symbols (a)
; *readtable*, (b) *package*, and (c) *features*.  In ACL2, the user can
; specify the package to use, via in-package, which sets the global
; current-package.  The user of ACL2 has no (legitimate) control over the
; readtable, which is set above and discussed below.
;
; As for *features*, we currently permit full use of the *features*
; facility of the Common Lisp reader, with this caveat: it is an
; official part of the ACL2 story that *features* should have the same
; setting throughout all phases of ACL2 usage.  That is, the user must
; set up *features* at the beginning, before starting to use ACL2 and
; the user must then leave *features* alone (even though the
; implementors of ACL2 put :acl2-loop-only onto *features* during
; boot-strapping).  One bad consequence of our *features* policy is that
; verified files will not in general be verifiable or usable in other
; Lisp implementations or installations unless the settings of
; *features* relevant to one's usages of the #+ and #- are the same in
; the two Lisp implementations.  One simple way to obtain peace of mind
; on this topic is for the user not to use #+ or #- at all!  It might be
; cleaner for us simply to prohibit the use of the #+ and #- readmacros
; all together in ACL2.  This could be done at the cost of replacing the
; many uses of #+ and #- in axioms.lisp, and a few other places, with
; some sort of regular macro.
;
; Below is a detailed examination of the default Common Lisp readtable
; from the perspective of ACL2.  We want to make sure that when we read,
; we do not have side effects (e.g. via #.) of ACL2 but will merely
; either (a) cause an error or (b) generate a Lisp object, which we then
; will check with bad-lisp-object before handing it to ACL2 functions.
;
; All of the standard Common Lisp characters are either white space or
; constituent, with the following exceptions, which are read macros:
;
;   "  quote
;   #  number sign
;   '  quote
;   () parentheses
;   ,  comma
;   ;  comment
;   \  single escape
;   `  backquote
;   |  multiple escape
;
; With the exception of number sign, backquote and comma, we certainly
; want all of these readmacros to have their usual Common Lisp
; semantics.
;
; We have defined our own backquote and discussed it above.
;
; We now review the # situation:
;
;   ## and #= are for reading possibly circular stuff
;          bad-lisp-object may run forever
;   #'  reads as function
;          won't hurt anything
;   #(  vector
;          will be rejected by bad-lisp-object
;   #)  signals an error
;          enough said
;   #*  bit vector
;          will be rejected by bad-lisp-object
;   #,  load-time evaluation
;          we shut it off
;   #0-#9 used for infix arguments
;          ok
;   #:  uninterned symbol
;          will be rejected by bad-lisp-object
;   #<  signals an error
;          enough said
;   #\  character object
;          will be checked by bad-lisp-object; see also below
;   #|  start comment, ended by |#
;          ok
;   #<backspace | tab | newline | linefeed | page | return | space>
;       signals an error -- ok
;   #+  and #-
;       see the discussion of *features* above
;   #.  read time evaluation
;          we restrict it
;   #A, #a  arrays
;          will be checked by bad-lisp-object
;   #B, #b  binary rational
;          ok
;   #C, #c complex
;          ok (rejected by bad-lisp-object except for rational components)
;   #O, #o octal
;          ok
;   #P, #p pathname
;          will be checked by bad-lisp-object
;   #R, #r radix-n
;          fine
;   #S, #s structure
;          will be rejected by bad-lisp-object
;   #X, #x hex
;          ok
;
; Eventually, it will be best to define a read function for ACL2 solely in terms
; of ACL2 character reading primitives.  Common Lisp read is ambiguous.  There is
; the ambiguity of backquote described above.  There is the ambiguity of which
; tokens get read as numbers.  To make matters a little more scary, there is
; nothing that prevents a Common Lisp implementation from adding, for example, a
; new # readmacro option that would provide something as potentially catastrophic
; as full-blown sharp-dot.  One obstacle to doing a read within ACL2 this is
; efficiency.  For example, ACL2 does not now support unread-char.  And given the
; requirement that whatever is specified in a guard must be checkable, it is
; unclear now how best to add unread-char since Common Lisp does permit one to
; detect whether a stream is in a ``just unread'' state.  ACL2 could enable one
; to answer such a question, but at the cost of having to store the information
; every time that a character was unread.


;          ACL2's Implementation of the character reader

; We have decided to take full charge of everything that # reader
; does, which is just a part of the way towards writing READ totally
; from scratch.  And we are pretty conservative about what #\ does
; accept; one can always get the characters one wants by using
; code-char.  Notice for example that if we're not careful, then ACL2
; could be potentially unsound when we have 8-bit characters, because
; it's conceivable that
;
; (equal (char-code "#\fifth-control-character") 5)
;
; is a theorem in one Common Lisp and yet
;
; (equal (char-code "#\fifth-control-character") 6)
;
; is a theorem in another.  Bizarre, but apparently not ruled out by
; dpANS.
;
; So, we manage this simply by modifying the character reader so that
; the #\ notation only works for single characters and for Space, Tab,
; Newline, Page, Rubout, and Return; an error is caused otherwise.

; Our algorithm for reading character objects starting with #\ is
; quite simple.  We accumulate characters until encountering a
; whitespace character or a terminating macro character, from the list
; *acl2-read-character-terminators*.  The result must be either a
; single standard character or else one of the names (up to case,
; which we ignore in the multiple-character case) SPACE, TAB, NEWLINE,
; PAGE, RUBOUT, and RETURN.  Otherwise we cause an error.  Note that
; if we do NOT cause an error, then any dpANS-compliant Common Lisp
; implementation's character reader would behave the same way, because
; dpANS says (in the section ``Sharpsign Backslash'') the following.

;    .....  After #\ is read, the reader backs up
;    over the slash and then reads a token, treating the initial slash
;    as a single escape character (whether it really is or not in the
;    current readtable).

; The rather involved description from dpANS in the section ``Reader
; Algorithm'' implies that when a token is terminated without error,
; it must be upon first encountering a whitespace character or a
; terminating macro character.

; Finally, here is an argument that we cannot reasonably allow ACL2 to
; accept character notations of the sort akcl allows, such as #\\112
; for #\J for example.  (By the way, 112 is octal for 74, which is
; (char-code #\J).)  This is sad, because it would have been nice to
; provide a way of reading arbitrary 8-bit characters in ACL2.

; In the following, we refer to documentation from Bill Schelter's
; info version of dpANS.

; So, assume that #\J parses the same as #\\112 (and we'll derive a
; ``contradiction'' of sorts).  The documentation from ``Sharpsign
; Backslash'' below implies that #\\112 parses as the character whose
; name is [STRING-UPCASE applied to] the 4-character string \112.  So
; if #\\112 parses as #\J, then the name of the character #\J is
; "\\112".  Then, the documentation for ``char-name'' (part of which
; is also below) implies that CHAR-NAME returns the character name,
; and hence (CHAR-NAME #\J) must be "\\112".  But probably this isn't
; true of the implementation (it's not true for akcl or allegro, for
; example).  And, it seems really dangerous for us to redefine
; CHAR-NAME in ACL2.

; What's worse, if we apply the first part of this argument to
; #\Newline, we see that the name of the character #\Newline is
; "\\12", which directly contradicts the final passage below from
; dpANS.

; In what follows we'll quote from dpANS (an emacs Info version).  We
; quote here from three sections, separated by ++++++++++++++++++.

; New ACL2 users sometimes do not notice that they are outside the ACL2
; read-eval-print loop when in a break.  See the discussion of "PROMPTS" in
; interface-raw.lisp for how we deal with this.  For GCL CLtL1, we currently
; (as of GCL version 2.6.6, and still at GCL version 2.6.12) need a patch for
; built-in function si::break-level in order to avoid going into raw Lisp in
; the default state, i.e., without having executed (set-debugger-enable t).
; This requires a package change, so we put that patch in a file that is not
; compiled; the present file serves nicely.  (Perhaps there's a better way?)

; However, we abandon this prompts mess for ANSI GCL, where it is not necessary
; in order to stay out of the debugger.
