; Clause Histories

; Clauses carry with them their histories, which describe which processes
; have produced them.  A clause history is a list of history-entry records.
; A process, such as simplify-clause, might inspect the history of its
; input clause to help decide whether to perform a certain transformation.

(defrec history-entry

; Important Note: This record is laid out this way so that we can use
; assoc-eq on histories to detect the presence of a history-entry for
; a given processor.  Do not move the processor field!

  (processor ttree clause signal . cl-id)
  t)

; Processor is a waterfall processor (e.g., 'simplify-clause).  The
; ttree and signal are, respectively, the ttree and signal produced by
; the processor on clause.  Each history-entry is built in the
; waterfall, but we inspect them for the first time in this file.

; Essay on Parent Trees

; Structurally, a "parent tree" or pt is either nil, a number, or the cons
; of two parent trees.  Parent trees are used to represent sets of
; literals.  In particular, every number in a pt is the position of some
; literal in the current-clause variable of simplify-clause1 and the tree
; may be thought of as representing that set of literals.  Pts are used
; to avoid tail biting.  An earlier implementation of this used "clause-tails."
; We explain everything below.

; "Tail biting" is our name for the insidious phenomenon that occurs when
; one assumes p false while trying to prove p and then, carelessly,
; rewrites the goal p to false on the basis of that assumption.  Observe
; that this is sound but detrimental to success.  One way to prevent
; tail biting is to not assume p false while trying to prove it, but we
; found that too weak.  The way we avoid tail biting is to keep careful
; track of what we're trying to prove, which literal we are working on,
; and what assumptions have been used to derive what results; we never use
; the assumption that p is false (or anything derived from it) to rewrite
; p to false.  Despite our efforts, tail biting by simplify-clause is
; possible.  See "On Tail Biting by Simplify-clause" for more.

; The easiest to understand use of parent trees in this regard is in
; linear arithmetic.  In simplify-clause1 we setup the
; simplify-clause-pot-lst, by expressing all the arithmetic hypotheses of
; the conjecture as polynomial inequalities.  When new inequalities are
; introduced, as when trying to relieve the hypothesis of some rule, we
; can combine them with the preprocessed "polys" to quickly settle certain
; arithmetic statements.  To avoid duplication of effort, our
; simplify-clause-pot-lst contains polys derived from all possible
; literals of the current clause.  This is because a great deal of work
; may be done (via linear lemmas and rewriting) to derive a poly about a
; given suggestive subterm of a given literal and we do not want to do it
; each time we assume that literal false.  Note the ease with which we
; could bite our tail: the list of inequalities is derived from the
; negations of every literal so we might easily use an inequality to
; falsify the literal from which it was derived.  To avoid this, each poly
; is tagged with one or more parent trees.  Intuitively the poly derived
; from an inequality literal is tagged with that literal.  But other
; literals may have been used, e.g., to establish certain terms rational,
; so one must think of the polys as being tagged with sets of literals.
; Then, when we are rewriting a particular literal we tell ourselves (by
; making a note in the :pt field of the rcnst) to avoid any poly
; descending from the goal literal.  Similar use is made of parent trees
; in the fc-pair-lst -- a list of preprocessed conclusions obtained by
; forward chaining from the current clause.

; The problem is made subtle by the fact that the literals we are
; rewriting change before we get to them and thus cannot be recognized by
; their structure alone.  Consider the clause {lit1 lit2 lit3}.  Now
; suppose we forward chain from ~lit3 and deduce concl.  Then fc-pair-lst
; will contain (concl . ttree) where ttree contains a parent tree
; acknowledging our dependence on lit3.  We may thus use concl when we are
; working on lit1 and lit2.  But suppose that in simplifying lit1 we
; produce the literal (not (equal var 27)).  Then we can substitute 27 for
; var everywhere and will actually do so.  Thus, by the time we get to
; work on the third literal of the clause above it will not be lit3 but
; some reduced instance, lit3', of lit3.  If the parent tree literally
; contained lit3, it would be impossible to recognize that concl was to be
; avoided.

; Therefore, we actually refer to literals by their position in the
; current-clause of simplify-clause1 (from which the preprocessing was
; done) and we keep careful track as we simplify what the original pt for
; each literal was.  As we scan over the literals to simplify we maintain
; a map, an enumeration of pts, giving the pt for each literal.  Thus,
; while we actually go to work on lit3' above, we will actually have in
; our hand the fact that lit3 is its parent.  Keeping track of the parents
; of the literals we are working on is made harder by the fact that
; sometimes literal merge.  For example, in {lit1 lit2 lit3} lit1 may
; simplify to lit3 and thus we may merge them.  The surviving literal is
; given the parent tree that contains both 1 and 3 so we know not to use
; conclusions derived from either.  The rewrite-constant, rcnst, in use
; below simplify-clause1 contains as one of its fields the
; :current-clause.  Thus, given the rewrite-constant and a pt it is
; possible to recover the original parent literals.

; We generally use "pt" to refer to a single parent tree.  "Pts" is a list
; of parent trees, implicitly in "weak 1:1 correspondence" with some list
; of terms.  By "weak" we mean pts may be shorter than the list of terms
; and "excess terms" have the nil pt.  That is, it is ok to cdr pts as you
; cdr down the list of terms and every time you need a pt for a term you
; take the car of pts.  There is no need to store the nil pt in tag-trees,
; so we don't.  Thus, a commonly used convention is to supply a pts of nil
; to a function that stores 'pts, causing it to store no pts.

; In the early days we did not use parent trees but "clause-tails" -- the
; tail of clause starting with the parent literal.  This was adopted to
; avoid the confusion caused by duplicate literals.  But it was rendered
; unworkable when we implemented the Satriani hacks and started
; substituting for variables as we went.  It also suffered other problems
; due to sloppy implementation.

; Essay on Tag-Trees

; If you add a new tag, be sure to include it in all-runes-in-ttree!

; Tags in Tag-Trees

; After Version_4.2 we switched to a representation of a tag-tree as an alist,
; associating a key with a non-empty list of values, rather than building up
; tag-trees with operations (acons tag value ttree) and (cons ttree1 ttree2).
; Note that we view these lists as sets, and are free to ignore order and
; duplications (though we attempt to avoid duplicates).   Our motivation was to
; allow the addition of a new key, associated with many values, without
; degrading performance significantly.

; Each definition of a primitive for manipulating tag-trees has the comment: "
; Note: Tag-tree primitive".

; See all-runes-in-ttree for the set of all legal tags and their associated
; values.  Some of the tags and associated values are as follows.

; 'lemma

; The tagged object is a rune.

; 'pt

; The tagged object is a "parent tree".  See the Essay on Parent Trees.
; The tree identifies a set of literals in the current-clause of
; simplify-clause1 used in the derivation of poly or term with which the
; tree is associated.  We need this information for two reasons.  First,
; in order to avoid tail biting (see below) we do not use any poly that
; descends from the assumption of the falsity of the literal we are trying
; to prove.  Second, in find-equational-poly we seek two polys that can be
; combined to derive an equality, and we use 'pt to identify those that
; themselves descend from equality hypotheses.

; 'assumption

; The tagged object is an assumption record containing, among other things, a
; type-alist and a term which must be true under the type-alist in order to
; assure the validity of the poly or rewrite with which the tree is associated.
; We cannot linearize (- x), for example, without knowing (rationalp x).  If we
; cannot establish it by type set reasoning, we add that 'assumption to the
; poly generated.  If we eventually use the poly in a derivation, the
; 'assumption will infect it and when we get up to the simplify-clause level we
; will split on them.

; 'find-equational-poly

; The tagged object is a pair of polynomials.  During simplify clause
; we try to find two polys that can be combined to form an equation we
; don't have explicitly in the clause.  If we succeed, we add the
; equation to the clause.  However, it may be simplified into
; unrecognizable form and we need a way to avoid re-generation of the
; equation in future calls of simplify.  We do this by infecting the
; tag-tree with this tag and the two polys used.

; Historical Note from the days when tag-trees were constructed using (acons
; tag value ttree) and (cons-tag-trees ttree1 ttree2):

; ; The invention of tag-trees came about during the designing of the linear
; ; package.  Polynomials have three "arithmetic" fields, the constant, alist,
; ; and relation.  But they then have many other fields, like lemmas,
; ; assumptions, and literals.  At the time of this writing they have 5 other
; ; fields.  All of these fields are contaminants in the sense that all of the
; ; contaminants of a poly contaminate any result formed from that poly.  The
; ; same is true with the second answer of rewrite.

; ; If we represented the 5-tuple of the ttree of a poly as full-fledged fields
; ; in the poly the best we could do is to use a balanced binary tree with 8
; ; tips.  In that case the average time to change some field (including the
; ; time to cons a new element onto any of the 5 contaminants) is 3.62 conses.
; ; But if we clump all the contaminants into a single field represented as a
; ; tag-tree, the cost of adding a single element to any one of them is 2
; ; conses and the average cost of changing any of the 4 fields in a poly is
; ; 2.5 conses.  Furthermore, we can effectively union all 5 contaminants of
; ; two different polys in one cons!

; The following function determines whether val with tag tag occurs in
; tree:

(defun tag-tree-occur (tag val ttree)

; Note: Tag-tree primitive

  (let ((pair (assoc-eq tag ttree)))
    (and pair ; optimization
         (member-equal val (cdr pair)))))

(defun remove-tag-from-tag-tree (tag ttree)

; Note: Tag-tree primitive

; In this function we do not assume that tag is a key of ttree.  See also
; remove-tag-from-tag-tree, which does make that assumption.

; remove-tag-from-tag-tree, which does not make that assumption.

  (remove1-assoc-eq tag ttree))

; A Little Foreshadowing:

; use.

; We have occasion for "fake-runes" which look like runes but are not.
; See the Essay on Fake-Runes below.  One such rune is shown below,

; enabled.  When this rune is used, its use is not recorded in the

; ; But starting in Version_3.2, we keep tagged objects unique in tag-trees, by

; Assumptions

; We are prepared to force assumptions of certain terms by adding
; them to the tag-tree under the 'assumption tag.  This is always done
; via force-assumption.  All assumptions are embedded in an
; assumption record:

(defrec assumnote (cl-id rune . target) t)

; The cl-id is the clause id (as maintained by the waterfall) of the clause
; currently being worked upon.  Rune is either the rune (or a symbol, as per
; force-assumption) that forced this assumption.  Target is the term to which
; rune was being applied.  Because the :assumnotes field of an assumption is
; always non-nil, there is at least one assumnote in it, but the cl-id field in
; that assumnote might be nil because we do not know the clause id just yet.
; We fill in the :cl-id field later so that we don't have to pass such static
; information all the way down to the places where assumptions are forced.
; When an assumption is generated, it has exactly one assumnote.  But later we
; will "merge" assumptions together (actually, delete some via subsumption) and
; when we do we will union the assumnotes together to keep track of why we are
; dealing with that assumption.

(defrec assumption
  ((type-alist . term) immediatep rewrittenp . assumnotes)
  t)

; An assumption record records the fact that we must prove term under
; the assumption of type-alist.  Immediatep indicates whether it is
; the user's desire to split the main goal on term immediately
; (immediatep = 'case-split), prove the term under alist immediately
; (t) or delay the proof to a forcing round (nil).

; WARNING: The system can be unsound if immediatep takes on any but
; these three values.  In functions like collect-assumptions we assume
; that collecting all the 'case-splits and then collecting all the t's
; gets all the non-nils!

; Assumnotes is involved with explaining to the user what we are doing.  It is
; a non-empty list of assumnote records.

; We now turn to the question of whether term has been rewritten or not.  If it
; has not been, and we know the context in which rewriting should be tried, it
; is presumably a good idea to try to rewrite term before we try a full-fledged
; proof: a proof requires converting the type-alist and term into a clause and
; then simplifying all the literals of that clause, whereas we expect many
; times that the type-alist will allow term to rewrite to t.  One might ask why
; we don't always rewrite before forcing.  The answer is simple: type-set
; forces and cannot use the rewriter because it is defined well before the
; rewriter.  So type-set forces unrewritten terms often.  The problem with the
; simple idea of trying first to prove those terms by rewriting is that REWRITE
; takes many additional context-specifying arguments, the most complicated
; being the simplify-clause-pot-lst.  Having set the stage for an explanation,
; we now give it:

; Rewrittenp indicates whether we have already tried to rewrite term.  Recall
; that relieve-hyp first rewrites and forces the rewritten term only if
; rewriting fails.  Thus, at least within the rewriter, we will see both
; rewritten and unrewritten assumptions coming back in the ttrees we generate.
; Rewrittenp is either a term or nil.  If it is a term, forced-term, then it is
; the term we were asked to force and term is the result of rewriting
; forced-term.  We use the unrewritten term in a heuristic that sometimes
; throws out supposedly irrelevant hypotheses from the clauses we ultimately
; prove to establish the assumptions.  See the discussion of "disguarding."  If
; rewrittenp is nil, we have not yet tried to rewrite term and term is
; literally what was forced.  The simplifier will collect the unrewritten
; assumptions generated during rewrite and will rewrite them in the
; "appropriate context" as discussed below.

; The view we take is that from within the rewriter, all assumptions are
; rewritten before being forced.  That cannot be implemented directly, so
; we do it cleverly, by rewriting them after the force but not telling
; the user.  It just seems like a good idea for the rewriter, of all the
; processes, to produce only rewritten assumptions.  Now those rewritten
; assumptions aren't maximally rewritten.  For example, an assumption
; might rewrite to an if and normalization etc. might produce a provable
; set of assumptions.  But we do not use normalization or clausification on
; assumptions until it is time to hit them with the full prover.

; The following record definition is decidedly out of place, belonging as it
; does to the code for forward-chaining.  But we must make it now to allow
; us to define contain-assumptionp.  This record is documented in comments
; in the essay entitled:  "Forward Chaining Derivations - fc-derivation - fcd"

  (rune target term type-alist rewrittenp immediatep force-flg ttree)

; Warning:  Rune may not be a rune!  It may be a function symbol.

; This function adds (implies type-alist' term) as an 'assumption to ttree.
; Rewrittenp is either nil, meaning term has not yet been rewritten, or is the
; term that was rewritten to obtain term.  Rune is the name of the rule in
; whose behalf term is being assumed, and rune is being applied to the target
; term target.  If rune is a symbol then it is actually a primitive
; function symbol and this is a split on the guard of that symbol.  There is
; even an exception to that: sometimes rune is the function symbol equal.  But
; the guard of equal is t and so is never forced!  What is going on?  In
; linearize we force term2 to be real if term1 is real and we are
; linearizing (equal term1 term2).

; The type-alist actually stored in the assumption record, type-alist', is not
; type-alist!  We remove from type-alist all the entries depending upon
; assumptions.  It is legitimate to throw away any hypothesis, thus we can
; delete the entries we choose.  Why do we throw out the type-alist entries
; depending on assumptions?  The reason is that in the forcing round we
; actually generate a formula representing (implies type-alist' term) and this
; formula does not encode the fact that a given hyp depends upon certain
; assumptions.

; Because assumptions can be generated during forward chaining, the type-alist
; may contain 'fc-derivations tags among its ttrees.  These records record how
; a given hypothesis was derived and may itself have 'assumptions in its ttree.
; We therefore consider a ttree to "contain assumptions" if it contains an
; fc-derivation that contains assumptions.

; It could be thought that the creation of type-alist' from type-alist is
; merely an efficiency aimed at saving a few conses.  This is not correct.
; This change has a dramatic effect on the size of our ttrees.  Before we did
; this, it was possible for a ttree to contain an assumption which (by virtue
; of the :type-alist) contained a ttree which contained an assumption which
; contained a ttree, etc.  We have seen this sort of thing nested to depth 9.
; Furthermore, it was frequently the case that a ttree contained some proper
; subttree x which occurred also in an assumption contained in the parent
; ttree.  Thus, the ttree x was duplicated.  While the parent ttree was small
; (in the sense that it contained on a few nodes) the tree was very large when
; printed, because of this duplication.  We have seen a ttree that contained 5
; million nodes (when explored in this root-and-branch way through 'assumptions
; and 'fc-derivations) but which actually was composed of only 100 distinct
; (non-equal) subtrees.  Again, one might think this was a problem only if one
; printed out the ttree, but some processes, such as expunge-fc-derivations, do
; root-and-branch exploration.  On the tree in question the system simply hung
; up and appeared to be in an infinite loop.  This fix keeps ttrees small (even
; when viewed in the root-and-branch way) and is crucial to our practice of
; using them.

; Once upon a time, we allowed rune to be nil.  We have since changed that and
; now use the *fake-rune-for-anonymous-enabled-rule* when we don't know a
; better rune.  But we have put a check in here to make sure no one uses the
; nil "rune" anymore.  Wanting a genuine rune here is just a reflection of the
; output routine that explains the origins of each forcing round.

; Force-flg is known to be non-nil; it may be either t or 'weak.  It's tempting
; to allow force-flg = nil and handle that case here (trivially), but the case
; structure in functions like type-set-binary-+ suggests that it's better to
; deal with that case up front, in order to avoid lots of tests that are
; irrelevant (since the same trivial thing happens in all cases when force-flg
; is nil).

; This function is a No-Change Loser, meaning that if it fails and returns nil
; as its first result, it returns the unmodified ttree as its second.  Note
; that either force-flg or nil is returned as the first argument; hence, a
; "successful" force with force-flg = 'weak will result in an unchanged
; force-flg being returned.  If the first value returned is nil, we are to
; pretend that we weren't allowed to force in the first place.

; At the time of this writing we have temporarily abandoned the idea of
; allowing force-flg to be 'weak:  it will always be t or nil.  See the comment

; We are about to get into the linear arithmetic stuff quite heavily.
; This code started in Nqthm in 1979 and migrated more or less
; untouched into ACL2, with the exception of the addition of the
; rationals.  However, around 1998, Robert Krug began working on an
; improved arithmetic book and after a year or so realized he wanted
; to make serious changes in the linear arithmetic procedures.
; Robert's hand is now felt all over this code.


; Essay on the Logical Basis for Linear Arithmetic.

; This essay was written for some early version of ACL2.  It still
; applies to the linear arithmetic decision procedure as of Version_2.7,
; although some of the details may need revision.

; We list here the "algebraic laws" we assume.  We point back to this
; list from the places we assume them.  It is crucial to realize that
; by < and + here we do not mean the familiar "guarded" functions of
; Common Lisp and algebra, but rather the "completed" functions of the
; ACL2 logic.  In particular, nonnumeric arguments to + are defaulted
; to 0 and complex numbers may be added to rational ones to yield
; complex ones, etc.  The < relation coerces nonnumeric arguments to 0
; and then compares the resulting numbers lexicographically on the
; real and imaginary parts, using the familiar less-than relation on
; the rationals.

; Let us use << as the "familiar" less-than.  Then
; (< x y) = (let ((x1 (if (acl2-numberp x) x 0))
;                 (y1 (if (acl2-numberp y) y 0)))
;            (or (<< (realpart x1) (realpart y1))
;                (and (= (realpart x1) (realpart y1))
;                     (<< (imagpart x1) (imagpart y1)))))

; The wonderful thing about this definition, is that it enjoys the algebraic
; laws we need to support linear arithmetic.  The "box" below contains the
; complete listing of the algebraic laws supporting linear arithmetic
; ("alsla").

; However, interspersed around them in the box are some events that ACL2's
; completed < and + have the ALSLA properties.  To enable us to use the theorem
; prover, we define some new symbols like < and + and prove that those symbols
; have the desired properties.  This is a bit tricky because the completed <
; and + must be defined in terms of the partial < and + which work on the
; rationals and complexes, respectively, and we do not want to rely on any
; built in properties of those primitive symbols.

; Therefore, we constrain three new symbols, PLUS, TIMES, and LESSP which you
; may think of as being the familiar, partial versions of +, *, and <.
; (Indeed, the witnesses in the constraints are those primitives.  The
; encapsulate below merely exports the properties that we are going to assume.)
; Then we define completed versions of these functions, called CPLUS, CTIMES,
; and CLESSP and we prove the ALSLA properties of those functions.

; Note: This exercise is still suspicious because it involves equality
; goals between arithmetic terms and there is no reason to believe that our
; "untrusted" linear arithmetic isn't contributing to their proof.  Well, a
; search through the output produces no sign of "linear" after the
; encapsulation below, but that could indicate an io bug.  A more convincing
; proof would be to eliminate the use of the arithmetic data types altogether
; but that would be a little nasty, faking rationals and complexes.  A still
; more convincing proof would be to construct the proof formally, as we hope to
; do when we have proof objects.

; Thus ends the ALSLA.  However, there are, no doubt, a few more that we
; will discover when we implement proof objects!

; Note that in Multiplication by Positive Preserves Inequality we require the
; positive to be rational.  Multiplication by a "positive" complex rational
; does not preserve the inequality.  For example, the following evaluates
; to nil:
; (let ((c #c(1 -10))
;       (x #c(1 1))
;       (y #c(2 -2)))
;  (implies (and ; (rationalp c)          ; omit the rationalp hyp
;                  (< 0 c))
;           (iff (< x y)                  ; t
;                (< (* c x) (* c y)))))   ; nil

; Thus, the coefficients in our polys must be rational.

; As of Version_2.6, we now use a different term-order when ordering
; the alist of a poly.  Arith-term-order is almost the same as
; term-order (which was used previously) except that 'UNARY-/ is
; `invisible' when it is directly inside a 'BINARY-*.  The motivation
; for this change lies in an observation that, when reasoning about
; floor and mod, terms such as (< (/ x y) (floor x y)) are common.
; However, when represented within the linear-pot-lst, (BINARY-* X
; (UNARY-/ Y)) was a heavier term than (FLOOR X Y) and so the linear
; rule (<= (floor x y) (/ x y)) never got a chance to fire.  Now,
; (FLOOR X Y) is the heavier term.

; Note that this function is something of a hack in that it works
; because "F" is later in the alphabet than "B".  It might be better
; to allow the user to specify an order; but, if the linear rules
; present in the community books are representative this
; is sufficient.  Perhaps this should be reconsidered later.

;; Historical Comment from Ruben Gamboa:
;; I thought about adding lines here for real numbers, but since we
;; cannot construct actual real constants, I don't think this is
;; needed here.  Besides, I'm not sure what the right value would be
;; for a real number!

; Warning: Keep this in sync with fn-count-1.

; We return a triple --- the variable count, the function count, and the
; pseudo-function count --- derived from term (and the three input
; accumulators).  "Invisible" functions not inside quoted objects are ignored,
; in the sense of the global invisible-fns-table.

; The fn count of a term is the number of function symbols in the unabbreviated
; term.  Thus, the fn count of (+ (f x) y) is 2.  The primitives of ACL2,
; however, do not give very natural expression of the constants of the logic in
; pure first order form, i.e., as a variable-free nest of function
; applications.  What, for example, is 2?  It can be written (+ 1 (+ 1 0)),
; where 1 and 0 are considered primitive constants, i.e., 1 is (one) and 0 is
; (zero).  That would make the fn count of 2 be 5.  However, one cannot even
; write a pure first order term for NIL or any other symbol or string unless
; one adopts NIL and 'STRING as primitives too.  It is probably fair to say
; that the primitives of CLTL were not designed for the inductive construction
; of the objects in an orderly way.  But we would like for our accounting for a
; constant to somehow reflect the structure of the constant rather than the
; structure of the rather arbitrary CLTL term for constructing it.  'A seems to
; have relatively little to do with (intern (coerce (cons #\A 'NIL) 'STRING))
; and it is odd that the fn count of 'A should be larger than that of 'STRING,
; and odder still that the fn count of "STRING" be larger than that of 'STRING
; since the latter is built from the former with intern.

; We therefore adopt a story for how the constants of ACL2 are actually
; constructed inductively and the pseudo-fn count is the number of symbols in
; that construction.  The story is as follows.  (z), zero, is the only
; primitive integer.  Positive integers are constructed from it by the
; successor function s.  Negative integers are constructed from positive
; integers by unary minus.  Ratios are constructed by the dyadic function quo
; on an integer and a natural.  For example, -2/3 is inductively built as (quo
; (- (s(s(z)))) (s(s(s(z))))).  Complex rationals are similarly constructed
; from pairs of rationals.  All characters are primitive and are constructed by
; the function of the same name.  Strings are built from the empty string, (o),
; by "string-cons", cs, which adds a character to a string.  Thus "AB" is
; formally (cs (#\A) (cs (#\B) (o))).  Symbols are constructed by "packing" a
; string with p.  Conses are conses, as usual.  Again, this story is nowhere
; else relevant to ACL2; it just provides a consistent model for answering the
; question "how big is a constant?"  (Note that we bound the pseudo-fn count;
; see fn-count-evg.)

; Previously we had made no distinction between the fn-count and the
; pseudo-fn-count, but Jun Sawada ran into difficulty because (term-order (f)
; '2).  Note also that before we had
; (term-order (a (b (c (d (e (f (g (h (i x))))))))) (foo y '2/3))
; but
; (term-order (foo y '1/2) (a (b (c (d (e (f (g (h (i x)))))))))).

; Proof.  Suppose ... < t3 < t2 < t1 is an infinite descending sequence. ...,
; (M t3), (M t2), (M t1) is weakly descending but not infinitely descending and
; so has a least element.  WLOG assume ... = (M t3) = (M t2) = (M t1).  By the
; finiteness of the inverse image of (M t1), { ..., t3, t2, t1} is a finite
; set, which has a least element under L, WLOG t27.  But t28 L t27 and t28 /=
; t27 by t28 < t27, contradicting the minimality of t27.  QED

; If (TERM-ORDER1 x y nil) and t2 results from replacing one occurrence of y
; with x in t1, then (TERM-ORDER1 t2 t1 nil).  Cases on why x is less than y.
; 1. If the number of occurrences of variables in x is strictly smaller than in
; y, then the number in t2 is strictly smaller than in t1.  2. If the number of
; occurrences of variables in x is equal to the number in y but the fn-count of
; x is smaller than the fn-count of y, then the number of variable occurrences
; in t1 is equal to the number in t2 but the fn-count of t1 is less than the
; fn-count of t2.  3. A similar argument to the above applies if the number of
; variable occurrences and fn-counts are the same but the pseudo-fn-count of x
; is smaller than that of y.  4. If the number of variable occurrences and
; parenthesis occurrences in x and y are the same, then (LEXORDER x y).
; (TERM-ORDER1 t2 t1 nil) reduces to (LEXORDER t2 t1) because the number of

; current-clause used in the production of the poly.

; The parents field is generally a list of parents and is set-eql to the union
; over all 'pt tags in ttree of the tips of the pts.  (But see the comment
; labeled ":parent wart" in linear-b.lisp for an exception.)  It is used in the
; code that ignores polynomials descended from the current literal.  (This used
; to be done by to-be-ignoredp, which used to take up to 80% of the time spent
; by add-poly.)  See collect-parents and marry-parents for how we establish and
; maintain this relationship, and ignore-polyp for its use.

; Rational-poly-p is a boolean flag used in non-linear arithmetic.  When it is
; true, then the right-hand side of the inequality (the polynomial) is known to
; have a rational number value.  (But note that for ACL2(r), i.e. for
; #+:non-standard-analysis, the value need only be real.  Through the linear
; and non-linear arithmetic code, references to "rational" should be considered
; as references to "real".)  The flag is needed because of the presence of
; complex numbers in ACL2's logic.  Note that sums and products of rational
; polys are rational.  When rational-poly-p is true we know that the product of
; two positive polys is also positive.

; Derived-from-not-equalityp keeps track of whether the poly in question was
; derived directly from a top-level negated equality.  This field is new to
; v2_8 --- previously its value was calculated as needed.  In the rest of this
; comment, we address two issues --- (1) What derived-from-not-equalityp is
; used for.  (2) Differences from earlier behavior.

; (1) What derived-from-not-equalityp is used for: In process-equational-polys,
; we scan through the simplify-clause-pot-lst and look for complementary pairs
; of inequalities from which we can derive an equality.  Example: from (<= x y)
; and (<= y x) we can derive (equal x y).  However, the two inequalities could
; have themselves been derived from the very equality we are about to generate,
; and this could lead to looping.  Thus, we tag those inequalities which stem
; directly from the linearization of a (negated) equality with
; :derived-from-not-equalityp = t.  This field is then examined in
; process-equational-polys (or rather its sub-functions), and the result is
; used to prune the list of candidate inequalities.

; (2) Differences from earlier behavior:
; Previously, the function descends-from-not-equalityp played the role of the
; new field :derived-from-not-equalityp.  This function was much more
; conservative in its judgement and threw out any poly which descended from an
; inequality in any way, rather than only those which were derived directly
; from a (negated) equality.  Matt Kaufmann noticed difference and provoked an
; email exchange with Robert Krug, who did the research and initial coding
; leading to this version of linear).  Here is Robert's reply.

;   Matt is right, I did inadvertantly change ACL2's meaning for
;   descends-from-not-equalityp.  Perhaps this change is also responsible
;   for some of the patches required for the regression suite.  However,
;   this change was inadvertant only because I did not properly understand
;   the old behaviour which seems odd to me.  I believe that the new
;   behaviour is the ``correct'' one.  Let us look at an example:
;
;   Input:
;
;   x = y       (1)
;   a + y >= b  (2)
;   a + x <= b  (3)
;
;   After cancellation:
;
;   y: x <= y      (1a)
;      b <= y + a  (2)
;
;      y <= x      (1b)
;
;   x: x + a <= b  (3)
;
;      b <= x + a  (4) = (1b + 2)
;
;   I think that some form of x + a = b should be generated and added to
;   the clause.  Under the new order, (3) and (4) would be allowed to
;   combine, because neither of them descended \emph{directly} from an
;   inequality.  This seems like the kind of fact that I, as a user, would
;   expect ACL2 to know and use.  Under the old regime however, since (1b)
;   was used in the derivation of (4), this was not allowed.
;
;   This raises the qestion of whether the new test is too liberal.  For
;   example, from
;
;   input:
;   x = y
;   a + x = b + y
;
;   We would now generate the equality a = b.  I do not see any harm in
;   this.  Perhaps another example will convince me that we need to
;   tighten the heuristic up.

; [End of Robert's reply.]

; Note: In Nqthm, we thought of polynomials being inequalities in a different
; logic, or at least, in an extension of the Nqthm logic that included the
; rationals.  In ACL2, we think of a poly as simply being an alternative
; representation of a term, in which we have normalized by the use of certain
; algebraic laws governing the ACL2 function symbols <, <=, +, and *.  We
; noted these above (see ALSLA).  In addition, we think of the operations
; performed upon polys being just ordinary inferences within the logic,
; justified by still other algebraic laws, such as that allowing the addition
; of inequalities.  The basic idea behind the linear arithmetic procedure is
; to convert the (arithmetic) assumptions in a problem (including the
; negation of the conclusion) to their normal forms, make a bunch of ordinary
; forward-chaining-like inferences from those assumptions guided by certain
; principles, and if a contradiction is found, deduce that the original
; assumptions imply the original conclusion.  The point is that linear
; arithmetic is not some model-theoretic step appealing to the correspondence
; of theorems in two different theories but rather an entirely
; proof-theoretic step.

; We expect polys to meet the following invariant implied in the discussion
; above:
; 1. The leading coefficient is +/-1
; 2. The leading unknown:
;    a. Is not a quoted constant --- Not much of an unknown/variable
;    b. Is not itself a sum --- A poly represents a sum of terms
;    c. Is not of the form (* c x), where c is a rational constant ---
;       The c should have been ``pulled out''.
;    d. Is not of the form (- c), (* c d), or (+ c d) where c and d are
;       rational constants --- These terms should be evaluated and added
;       onto the constant, not used as an unknown.
;    Some of these are implied by others, but we check them each
;    independently.

; Mini-essay on looping and linear arithmetic

; Robert Krug has written code to solve a problem with infinite loops related
; to linear arithmetic.  The following example produces the loop in ACL2
; Versions 2.4 and earlier.

;  (defaxiom *-strongly-monotonic
;    (implies (and (< a b))
;             (< (* a c) (* b c)))
;    :rule-classes :linear)
;
;  (defaxiom commutativity-2-of-*
;    (equal (* x y z)
;           (* y x z)))
;
;  (defstub foo (x) t)
;
;  (thm
;   (implies (and (< a (* a c))
;                 (< 0 evil))
;            (foo x)))

; The defconst below stops the loop.  We may want to increase it in the future,
; but it appears to be sufficient for certifying ACL2 community books.  It is
; used together with the field loop-stopper-value of the record linear-pot.
; When a linear-pot is first created, its loop-stopper-value is 0 (see
; add-poly).  See add-linear-lemma for how loop-stopper-value is used to detect
; loops.

; Robert has provided the following trace, in which one can still see the first
; few iterations of the loop before it is caught by the loop-stopping mechanism
; now added.  He suggests tracing new-and-ugly-linear-varp and worse-than to
; get some idea as to why this loop was not caught before due to the presence
; of the inequality (< 0 evil).

; Historical note:

; The following functions --- add-polys0 and its callees --- have been
; substantially rewritten.  Previous to Version_2.8 the following
; two comments were in add-poly and add-poly1 (which no longer exists)
; respectively:

; Add-poly historical comment

; ; This is the fundamental function for changing a pot-lst.  It adds a
; ; single poly p to pot-lst.  All the other functions which construct
; ; pot lists do it, ultimately, via calls to add-poly.
;
; ; In nqthm this function was called add-equation but since its argument
; ; is a poly we renamed it.
;
; ; This function adds a poly p to the pot-lst.  Since the pot-lst is
; ; ordered by term-order on the vars, we recurse down the pot-lst just
; ; far enough to find where p fits.  There are three cases: p goes
; ; before the current pot, p goes in the current pot, or p goes after
; ; the current pot.  The first is simplest: make a pot for p and stick
; ; it at the front of the pot-lst.  The second is not too bad: cancel p
; ; against every poly of opposite sign in this pot to generate a bunch
; ; of new polys that belong earlier in the pot-lst and then add p to
; ; the current pot.  The third is the worst: Recursively add p to the
; ; rest of the pot-lst, get back a bunch of polys that need processing,
; ; process the ones that belong where you're standing and pass up the
; ; ones that go earlier.

; Add-poly1 historical comment

; ; This is a subroutine of add-poly.  See the comment there.  Suppose
; ; we've just gotten back from a recursive call of add-poly and it
; ; returned to us a bunch of polys that belong earlier in the pot-lst
; ; (from it).  Some of those polys may belong here where we are
; ; standing.  Others should be passed up.
;
; ; To-do is the list of polys produced by the recursive add-poly.  Var,
; ; positives, and negatives are the appropriate components of the pot
; ; that add-poly is standing on.  We process those polys in to-do that
; ; go here, producing new positives and negatives, and set aside those
; ; that don't go here.  The processing of the ones that do go here may
; ; create some additional polys that don't go here.  To-do-next is the
; ; accumulation site for the to-do's we don't handle and the ones our
; ; processing creates.

; Add-poly is still the fundamental routine for adding a poly to the
; pot-lst.  However, we now merely gather up newly generated polys and
; pass them back out to add-polys --- changing the routines which
; add polys to the pot list from a depth-first search to a
; breadth-first search.

(defun add-poly (p pot-lst to-do-next pt nonlinearp)

; This is the fundamental function for changing a pot-lst.  It adds a
; single poly p to pot-lst.  All the other functions which construct
; pot lists do it, ultimately, via calls to add-poly.

; This function adds a poly p to the pot-lst and returns 3 values.
; The first is the standard contradictionp.  The second value, of
; interest only when we don't find a contradiction, is the new pot-lst
; obtained by adding p to pot-lst.  The third value is a list of new
; polys generated by the adding of p to pot-lst, which must be
; processed.  We cons our own generated polys onto the incoming
; to-do-next to form this result.

; An invariant exploited by infect-new-polys is that all of the new
; polys in any linear pot occur at the front of the list and no polys
; are ever deleted.  That is, if this or any other function wants to
; add a poly to the positives, say, it must cons it onto the front.
; In general, if we have an old linear pot and a new one produced from
; it and we want to process all the polys in the positives, say, of the
; new pot that are not in the old one, it suffices to process the first
; n elements of the new positives, where n is the difference in their
; lengths.

; Note:  If adding a poly creates a new pot, its loop-stopper value is set to
; 0.  This is changed to the correct value (if necessary) in
; add-linear-lemma.
