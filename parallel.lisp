; Section: To Consider.  The following might be good to address as time
; permits.

;   Change the piece of work list to an array (perhaps result in a faster
;   library because of less garbage.

;   Make removing closures from the queue destructive, in particular with
;   regard to early termination.

;   Recycle locks, perhaps for example in wait-on-condition-variable-lockless.
;   See this same comment in parallel-raw.lisp.

;   Provide a way for the user to modify *core-count*, including inside the
;   ACL2 loop.  If we allow for changing *core-count*, then we need to think
;   about allowing for changing variables that depend on it, e.g.,
;   *unassigned-and-active-work-count-limit* (perhaps by changing them to
;   zero-ary functions).  If you consider making such a change, then think
;   about how functions cpu-core-count and cpu-core-count-raw might be
;   relevant.

;   Modify the coefficient (currently 2) in the definition of
;   *unassigned-and-active-work-count-limit*.  Evaluate such modifications with
;   testing, of course.

; End of Section "To Consider".

; ; with-prover-time-limit is used, then the main thread (which is the one
; ; calling waterfall-step) has a catch (implemented by the call there of
; ; catch-time-limit5) that will only catch throws to that tag from the SAME
; ; thread.  We will get in trouble if a spawned thread's call of rewrite does
; ; such a throw.
;
; ; Warning: Moreover, if we use this code, consider modifying the
; ; rewrite-constant to store the value of :limit in
; ; rewrite-args-granularity-table.  Otherwise, we have to go to the world with a
; ; potentially slow getprop every time we call rewrite-args-par-big-enough.
; ; Maybe that's just noise, but maybe it's expensive.
;
; ; We initially set the value of (the unique key) :limit to nil in
; ; rewrite-args-granularity-table, so that in fact we do not do such

; Parallelism wart: when set-verify-guards-eagerness is 0, and there is a guard
; violation in subfunctions that are evaluating in the non-main-thread, we get
; errors that aren't user friendly (the errors occur in the non-main-threads).
; I think that the solution to this problem might necessitate catching the
; errors and re-causing them.  Hitting ctrl+c causes the main thread to abort
; waiting on the result from those threads, and allows the interactive session
; to resume.  David says that he may have already fixed this for spec-mv-let,
; and for the other parallelism primitives, the solution may be for the closure
; to bind *ld-level* to the value inherited from each thread's parent.  As of
; this writing (1/13/2012), we can see the unfortunate need for control-c in
; the following example:
; (defun f (x) (declare (xargs :guard (integerp x))) (+ x x))
; (defun g ()
;   (declare (xargs :guard t :verify-guards nil))
;   (plet ((a (f (car (make-list 1000000))))
;          (b (f (car (make-list 1000000)))))
;         (+ a b)))
; (g)

; The definition of with-output-lock can be found as (deflock <comments>
; *output-lock*) in ACL2 source file axioms.lisp.

; Parallelism wart: it is still possible in ACL2(p) to receive an error at the
; Lisp-level when CCL cannot "create thread".  An example of a user (Kaufmann)
; encountering this error is shown below, with community book
; concurrent-programs/bakery/stutter2.  In March 2012, Kaufmann's laptop could
; sometimes exhibit this problem (a 2-core machine with 4 hardware threads).
; There are two possible ways to fix this problem.  The first is to set the
; default-total-parallelism-work-limit to a lower number so that it never
; occurs (but this costs performance).  Kaufmann suggests that we should also
; catch this particular Lisp error and instead cause an ACL2 error, similar to
; the error in function not-too-many-futures-already-in-existence.  This may be
; harder than one might initially think, because our current mechanism for
; catching errors in child threads involves catching thrown tags and then
; rethrowing them in the thread who is that child's parent.

; The error looks like the following:
