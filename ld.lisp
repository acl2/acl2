; file loader.

(defun default-print-prompt (channel state)

; This is the default function for printing the ACL2 ld loop prompt.  A typical
; prompt looks like: ACL2 !>, where the number of >'s indicates the ld-level.
; The prompt is printed by (fmt "~@0~sr ~@1~*2" a channel state nil), where a
; is an alist computed from current-package, ld-level, default-defun-mode,
; guard-checking-on, and ld-skip-proofsp, and #\r is bound to "" except for the
; #+:non-standard-analysis version, where it is bound to "(r)".  To keep from
; consing up this alist every time, we memoize it, storing in 'prompt-memo the
; tuple (pkg level skipp defun-mode+ gc-on a), where defun-mode+ is the
; default-defun-mode except in raw-mode, where defun-mode+ is nil.  Thus, if
; the current settings are as in the memo, we use the a in the memo.
; Otherwise, we compute and store a new memo.

; Warning:  If you change the default prompt format, be sure to change it
; in eval-event-lst, where we print it by hand.

; We copy alist (reversing it) onto new-alist, checking that each pair in it
; binds an LD special to a legitimate value.  We open the requested files as we
; go and replace the file names with the open channels.  We also accumulate
; into channel-closing-alist the pairs necessary to close (with close-channels)
; the channels we have opened.  We return a pair consisting of the new-alist
; and the final channel-closing-alist.  See chk-acceptable-ld-fn1-pair for an
; explanation of co-string and co-channel.

; Implementation Note: This odd structure has the single redeeming feature that
; if any given pair of alist causes an error, we have in our hands enough
; information to close any channels we might have opened thus far.  If we get
; all the way down alist without causing an error, the channel-closing-alist
; will be used in the acl2-unwind-protect cleanup form and enable us to "close
; on pop" -- which was its original purpose.  But an earlier coding of this
; function suffered from the problem that we could open several channels and
; then, right here, cause an error (e.g., the proposed 'current-package setting
; is bad).  If that happened, those open channels would never be closed.  It is
; still possible to "lose" an opened channel: abort this function after some
; files have been opened.

; This flaw cannot be fixed, at least with the current set of primitives.  To
; close a channel we must have the channel.  We don't have the channel until
; after we have opened it, i.e., the way we get our hands on a channel in ACL2
; is to open a file, but the way we close a channel is to call
; close-output-channel on the channel object (rather than the file).  Thus,
; there is no way we can unwind protect code that opens a channel so as to
; guarantee to close the channel because we can't get the object we are to
; "cleanup" (the channel) until after we have "modified" (opened) it.  So there
; is a window of vulnerability between the time we open the channel and the
; time we stash it away in some location known to our cleanup form.  During
; that window an abort can cause us to lose a channel in the sense that we do
; not close it.  Now we can make that window much smaller than it is now.  As
; things stand now we are vulnerable to aborts from the time we start
; processing alist here until we finish and enter the acl2-unwind-protect in
; ld-fn that "binds" the ld specials.  But all this vulnerability means is that
; lisp fails to close some opened channels during an abort.  If such a thing
; happens, the user could detect it with some poking around.  For example, he
; could just type

; (open-output-channel-p 'ACL2-OUTPUT-CHANNEL::STANDARD-CHARACTER-OUTPUT-i
;                        :character state)

; for a bunch of i starting at 0 and see if there are some he doesn't know
; about.  This is not a catastrophic error.  It is as though the abort placed
; in the open-output-channels field of the state an additional channel or two.
; The only way, as far as we can see, that this can be a problem is in the
; sense of resource exhaustion: operating systems (and thus lisps) generally
; allow a finite number of open channels.

; If we someday endeavor to plug this hole some additional care must be taken
; because the act of opening an ACL2 channel (in raw lisp) is non-atomic -- we
; have to open the stream, generate a channel symbol, and store some stuff on
; the property list of the symbol.  So an abort there can cause an
; irretrievable loss of an open channel unless the problem is addressed down
; there as well.

; Finally we would just like to note that soft errors are handled perfectly
; here in the sense that if some channels are opened and then we get a soft
; error, we close the channels.  And aborts are handled perfectly once we get
; outside of the window of vulnerability discussed.

; when t, indicates that an error occurred, e.g., an ill-formed keyword command
; was read.  The error message has been printed.  Keyp, when non-nil, indicates
; that form is the parsed form of a keyword command.  The list of objects
; actually read is the non-nil value of keyp and that list, without the
; enclosing parentheses, should be printed instead of form.  Thus, if :kons is

;           The Tall Texas Tale about  BIG-CLOCK

; Like any Lisp system, it may be said, loosely speaking, that ACL2
; typically reads a form, evaluates it in the current state, and
; prints the result.  This read-eval-print activity in ACL2 is done by
; the function ld-fn.  When the user enters ACL2 by invoking (LP),
; ld-fn is called to do the work.

; The read phase of the read-eval-print activity is done with the
; read-object function, which calls the Common Lisp read function.
; This read is influenced by *package*, *readtable*, and *features*,
; as described in acl2.lisp.

; The semantics of an ACL2 read-eval-print cycles is best described
; from the logical point of view via the logic programming paradigm, to
; which we digress momentarily.  In the Lisp paradigm, one thinks
; of an interaction as always being something like

; >  (fact 3) = ?

; wherein a variable free term is evaluated to obtain a suitable
; value, say 6.  In logic programming, as in Baroque or Prolog, one
; can ask a question like:

; ? (fact x) = 6

; i.e. does there exist an x whose factorial is 6?  The system then
; attempts to answer the question and may find one or several values for
; x that does the job, e.g. 3.  In fact, one can even imagine asking

; ? (fact x) = y

; to obtain a variety of values of x and y that satisfy the relation.
; Or might might merely be informed that that, yes, there do exist
; values of x and y satisfying the relation, without being given x and
; y explicitly.

; The point of this digression is merely to mention the well-known
; (but non-Lispish) idea that the input to a computation need not
; always be given entirely in advance of the commencement of a
; computation.  In truth, even in regular Common Lisp, the input is not
; really always given entirely in advance because the characters that
; may appear in *standard-input* or the file system need not be known
; before evaluation commences.  ACL2 employs this ``incompletely
; specified at evaluation commencement'' idea.

; From the logical point of view, an ACL2 ``state'' is any object in
; the logic satisfying the state-p predicate, q.v. in axioms.lisp.
; There is a long comment in axioms.lisp under the heading STATE which
; describes the many fields that a state has.

; At the beginning of any interaction with the top-level ACL2 ld-fn,
; there is a ``partial current state'', which may be partially
; perceived, without side-effect, in Common Lisp, but outside of ACL2,
; by invoking (what-is-the-global-state).  This partial current-state
; includes (a) the names, types, and times of the open input and
; output channels (but not the characters read or written to those
; channels), (b) the symbols in the global table, (c) the t-stack, (d)
; the 32-bit stack, and (e) the file clock.  We say that an object o
; satisfying state-p is ``consistent with the current partial state''
; provided that every fact revealed by (what-is-the-global-state) and
; by examination of the bound globals is true about o.

; In Lisp (as opposed to Prolog) the input form has no explicit free
; variable.  In ACL2, however, one free variable is permitted, and
; this variable, always named STATE, refers, loosely speaking to the
; ``value of the state at the time of input''.  In ACL2, the variable
; STATE includes the input via files and channels.


;                   Common LISP IO

; If we have a Common Lisp system that is connected to an IO system,
; then at each tick of time, the system may (a) print a character,
; byte, or object to any of the open streams, (b) read a character,
; byte, or object from any of the open streams, (c) open a file for
; reading or writing and (c) close an open stream.

; Suppose that old and new are two objects satisfying state-p and that
; we have an implementation of ACL2 in a Common Lisp which is
; connected to an IO system.  We say that old and new are ``IO
; consistent with the Common Lisp IO system's behavior in the time
; period between old and new'' provided that the relationships between
; the various io fields of old and new are just what happened.  For
; example, suppose that old and new are different only in that in new
; on one input character channel one character has been consumed.
; Then that is consistent with a Common Lisp IO system in which the
; stream corresponding to the channel was read to get just one
; character.  As another example, suppose that old and new are
; different only because a file is now on read-files that was not
; there before and file-clock has been ticked twice and the two most
; recent values of the file clock are the open and close time of the
; read file.  Then that is consistent with a Common Lisp IO system in
; which a stream for a file of the read file's name was opened and
; consumed and the characters read were exactly the characters
; associated with the file name in readable-files at the file-clock
; upon open.  This concept needs to be completely and fully spelled
; out, but we believe it is all boring and obvious:  the file clock is
; to keep track of the opening and closing times.  The read-files and
; written-files entries record closing times and contents.  The
; readable-files and input channels entries record characters actually
; consumed.

; In the extremely important degenerate case, old and new are
; consistent with the Common Lisp IO system's behavior over a time
; interval if all the fields of old and new are identical, excepting
; only the global-table, stacks, and big-clock entries, and no IO
; occurred in the time interval.


;                        The ACL2 ld theorem

; Let us suppose, without loss of generality, that run is a function
; of one argument, state, that has been defined by the user, and
; accepted by ACL2.  Let us further suppose that run returns a single
; state value.  (There is no loss of generality here because any
; particular arguments or output value that the user wishes to provide
; or see can be placed in state globals.  For example, one could add
; two to three by defining run as (defun run (state) (f-set-global
; 'foo (+ 2 3)))).  Let us suppose that an ACL2 interaction of the
; form

; ACL2 !> (run state)

; completes.  What is the theorem that describes the relationship
; between the old current partial state and the new current partial
; state?  The theorem is that (a) there exists an object, old, which
; satisfies the predicate statep and an object, new, which also
; satisfies the predicate statep such that old is consistent with the
; partial current state at the time of the input and new is consistent
; with the partial current state at the time of the output (b) new and
; old are IO consistent with the Common Lisp IO system's behavior in
; the time period between the beginning and ending of the evaluation
; (c) new = (trans-eval '(run state) nil old t), and (d) (run old) =
; (trans-eval '(run state) nil old t) except in the big-clock field.

; In the important degenerate case in which no io occurs, this means
; essentially that there exists (in the constructive sense) a
; big-clock entry in old which is ``large enough'' to perform the
; trans-eval of the input form without ``running out of time''.  ACL2
; does not reveal to the user how much ``time'' was required, but
; merely guarantees that there exists a sufficiently large amount of
; time.  In fact, because we ``jump into compiled code'' in
; raw-ev-fncall, we have no way of efficiently keeping track of how
; much time has been used.

; Note that there is no commitment to a uniform value for big-clock
; across all ACL2 interactions.  In particular, there obviously exists
; an infinite sequence of forms, say (fact 1), (fact 2), (fact 3),
; ....  which would require an infinitely increasing series of
; big-clocks.  An ACL2 evaluation effort may fail for a variety of
; reasons, including resource errors and certain design decisions,
; e.g. the detection that a function should not be clobbered because
; there is already a function by that name with a symbol-function
; property.  If evaluation fails, some characters may nevertheless
; have been printed or read and state may have been changed.

; Changes made March 9-16, 2009 (after v3-4), for more efficient handling of

; The Essay on Skip-proofs was redone, and a new Essay on Soundness Threats was

; idea is that we have eliminated state globals 'skipped-proofsp and
; include-book-alist-state, instead tracking more in the world
; (e.g. include-book-alist-all).  See in particular install-event, which
; handles such matters, and note that maybe-add-command-landmark no longer does
; so.  (We also changed include-book-fn and encapsulate-fn for this purpose.)
; We added state global 'skip-proofs-by-system to help (again, see
; install-event).

; Of course, there were miscellaneous supporting changes, some in comments.  In
; particular, we (about a month later) eliminated chk-certification-worldxxx.
; Also, eval-event-lst now returns an extra element, which can be a natural
; number we can supply to nthcdr to eliminate some expense from our call of
; pkg-names in certify-book-fn.  This value is passed to
; process-embedded-events, and back from it in the case that the caller is
; 'certify-book.

; We also changed checksum usage so that we don't include the expansion-alist
; with the events from the actual book.  For calls of check-sum-obj on event
; lists that support the handling of certificates, we now use only the events
; from the book ev-lst and no longer include events in the expansion-alist.
; Instead, we rely on the checksum of the cert-obj, which is still
; incorporated in the certificate, for ensuring that we have the right
; expansion-alist.  Notice however that this extra security disappears when
; state global 'book-hash-alistp is true.

; The difference between puff and puff* is that puff* iterates puff across the
; region generated by the first puff until there are no more commands that are
; puffable.  Before continuing, we illustrate how we determine the bounds of
; the region in question.  We bound the region with relative command numbers.
; Suppose we are asked to puff* cd, where cd points to relative command number
; 12 below.

; 12   cmd1   ; ptr = 12 = the relative command number indicated by cd
; 13   cmd2
; 14   cmd3   ; mx = latest command

; Then mx, above, will be 14 and ptr will be 12.  Observe that there are two
; commands then that are not part of the region to be puffed, namely commands
; 13 and 14.  Now after puffing once, we will have something like:

; 12   cmd1a
; 13   cmd1b
; ...
; 19   cmd1h
; 20   cmd2
; 21   cmd3

; Observe that the new max command number is 21.  The region to be recursively
; puffed now lies between 12 and 19, inclusive.  The last two commands, now
; numbered 20 and 21, are outside the region.

; Let k be (- mx ptr), i.e., 2 in this example and, in general, the number of
; commands not in the region.  Then in general we should recursively puff
; commands whose numbers are between ptr and (- max k), where max is the
; current maximum relative command number, inclusive.  Initially this region
; contains just one command, the one we are to puff first.  ;

; Essay on Metafunction Support, Part 2

; For the first part of this essay, see ``Metafunction Support, Part
; 1'' in axioms.lisp.  This code is here at the end of ld so that it
; can use all our utilities and functions.

; We here turn to the problem of defining the uninterpreted functions
; that can actually be executed within a meta-level function.  Review Part 1 of
; the essay for the background and basic strategy.  We take up from there.

; Note: You can add other uninterpreted functions linked to theorem
; prover :program functions.  However, you should obey the following
; rules.

; (1) Of course, the metafunction context must be rich enough (or made
; rich enough) to provide the necessary arguments.  If you change the
; structure of metafunction-context, you must modify the accessors
; defined above mfc-clause, in axioms.lisp, or else the build will fail
; with a redefinition error.

; (2) Include STATE as an argument to the uninterpreted symbol,
; whether it is otherwise needed or not.

; Essay on Saved-output

; Starting with Version_2.9.2, ACL2 has the capability of running not only with
; output inhibited but also with output saved, to be printed upon demand by pso
; and pso! (see their documentation).  This capability is controlled by state
; global variables whose names start with SAVED-OUTPUT-, namely:
; 'saved-output-reversed, 'saved-output-token-lst, and 'saved-output-p.  State
; global 'print-clause-ids was also introduced at the same time, in order to
; allow printing of clause ids with output inhibited in order that the user can
; observe progress of the proof.

; Why do we need both 'saved-output-p and 'saved-output-token-lst?  The latter
; records the output that the user wants saved (typically, :all or nil).  The
; former activates the saving of output, which is why it is bound to t in
; with-ctx-summarized.  The idea is that we do not want to save output that
; comes from top-level calls by the user that are not event forms, so
; 'saved-output-p remains nil at the top level.

; Perhaps we should add a mechanical check that there are no nested calls of
; io?, since such calls could confuse our mechanism for saving output.

; Implementation note: Calls of io? on a given body take as an argument a
; listing of all the free variables of that body.  After the definitions below,
; a macro call (av body) will print out such a list.
