;                            TRACE stuff

; This file is allegro-acl2-trace, with modifications.

; CCL's trace facilities are somewhat limited.  However it does have a
; function, advise, which is sufficiently general to allow it to imitate GCL's
; trace facilities as provided within ACL2.  This function seems to have
; limited documentation, but see the file ccl/lib/encapsulate.lisp in the
; CCL sources.

; We put over into old-trace the macro for trace that comes with CCL.
; Thus one can type (old-trace foo) and get the effect that (trace
; foo) would have previously provided.  We do not guarantee that using
; old-trace works well with trace$, however.
