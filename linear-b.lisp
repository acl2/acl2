; We continue our development of linear arithmetic.  In particular,
; we define the functions add-polys and linearize.

(defun polys-from-type-set (term force-flag dwp type-alist ens wrld ttree)

; If possible, we create a list of polys based upon the type-set
; of term.

; Warning: This function should not be used with any terms that are
; not legitimate pot-vars.  See the definition of good-pot-varp.
; Assuming that term is a legitimate pot-label --- meets all the
; invariants --- we do not have to normalize any of the polys below.

; We check that term is OK and throw an error if not.  It would,
; however, not be very expensive to wrap the below in a call to
; normalize-poly-lst, and thereby avoid the potential error situation.

; Suppose linearize is called on some term, term.  The output of
; linearize is either nil, (list (list poly1 poly2)), or (list (list
; poly1) (list poly2)).  An answer of the first form means "no
; arithmetic information can be extracted from the assumption that
; term is true."  An answer of the second form means "both poly1 and
; poly2 are true if term is true."  An answer of the third form means
; "either poly1 or poly2 is true if term is true."

; This functions takes two polys and an operation, op, and constructs
; the answer returned by linearize.  Op is either 'and or 'or and
; determines whether we construct (list (list poly1 poly2)), when
; op='and, or (list (list poly1) (list poly2)), when op='or.

; However, there are two special cases.

; First, it is sometimes the case that we want to construct an 'and
; but only have one poly, the other one being nil.  This may happen
; when we were going to construct an 'or but noticed that one branch
; is contradictory.  When this happens it is always poly1 that is nil
; and poly2 that we want to return.

; Second, it may happen that either or both of the polys are silly in
; the sense that they are based on false assumptions.  Since silly polys
; are logically true, we act accordingly.  Thus, if we are to return
; a conjunction and one of the polys is silly we return the other.
; But if we are to return a disjunction and one is silly, we return nil,
; meaning we could extract no arithmetic information.  For example,
; suppose poly2 is silly and we are to return (list (list poly1) (list poly2)).
; Then the silliness of poly2 means the second disjunct is true, which
; is represented here as (list (list poly1) nil).  That, by the way, was
; nqthm's answer in this case.  However, this disjunct gives the caller
; no help because it means either poly1 is true or T is true.  So we
; just tell the caller "no information".

; Note about Nqthm:  As remarked above, nqthm's linearize can return
; (list (list poly1) nil).  How is this used?  It is put on the
; split-lst when we start adding polynomials to the pot.  We then see if
; we can get a contradiction from one side and if so, we assume the other.
; We certainly can't get a contradiction from the nil side.  Suppose
; we got a contradiction from the other.  Then we'd assume the other
; side, which is a no-op.  The end result is that returning such an
; answer causes work but is guaranteed to have no effect.

; It is unlikely that we can generate a silly poly2 without generating a
; silly poly1, since silliness stems from requiring a false rationalp
; assumption.  However, rather than convince ourselves that they are
; both silly if either is, we'll just check both.

; rationalp-flg is only used in non-linear arithmetic, this seems like a minor
; break from our traditional propagation of parent trees.  We considered making
; a similar change for all calls of base-poly in this function, but that led to
; a proof failure in community book
; books/workshops/2004/schmaltz-borrione/support/routing_defuns.lisp that
; looked like it would be painful to fix, and we took that as a sign that such
; loss of backward compatibility could be painful for other users, and

; This is a strange one.  It can happen that the

; saw this happen in a bug reported by Jun Sawada.  Suppose (<= 2 (foo
; x)) is a :LINEAR lemma about foo.  Suppose we wish to prove (not
; (equal 1 (foo 3))).  This should be obvious.  But we assume the
; negation of the conclusion and get (foo 3) = 1.  We then find the
; linear lemma and instantiate it to get (<= 2 (foo 3)).  We then
; rewrite-linear-concl and get (<= 2 1), which we eval to 'nil!  If we
; do not recognize that we've succeeded here, we do not prove the
; theorem because all manner of other heuristics prevent us from using
; (<= 2 (foo x)) against the current literal.  Not surprisingly, this
; is an example of tail biting: we've used the negation of the goal to
; prevent ourselves from proving it!  One could probably construct a
; more insidious example of tail biting from this example -- an
; example that is not solved by the hack here of recognizing when eval
; solved our problem -- by arranging for rewrite-linear-concl to
; rewrite the inequality to something that we can't use but which
; doesn't eval to nil.

; This function linearizes every term in term-lst, using the parity
; indicated by positivep, and type-alist and wrld.  This effectively
; assumes true/false (as per positivep) each term in term-lst and produces
; some polys.  Ttrees is in weak 1:1 correspondence with term-lst and
; enumerates the parent trees to use for each term in all the polys
; generated for the term; if ttrees is nil, no parent tree is stored.

; We return two values, poly-lst and split-lst.  The first is a list of
; polys that may be assumed true.  I.e., all these polys are implied by the
; assumption of term-lst.  The second is a list of doublets (lst1 lst2),
; such that each lst is a list of polys and the assumption of term-lst
; implies one of either lst1 or lst2 for each doublet.
